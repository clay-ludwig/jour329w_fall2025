    "content": "SAN MATEO, Calif. – On a cool Friday morning in April, the halls of California’s San Mateo High School were full of students chatting, running to class or trying to find their friends. \nBut one common sight in high schools across the country was and always is absent from the halls of San Mateo: cellphones. \n“When you look at the crowd, kids are not buried in their phone,” said Yvonne Shiu, the school’s principal. “They have grown to value being in the moment.”\nSan Mateo High School Principal Yvonne Shiu works in her office on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nStudents at the public high school about 20 minutes south of San Francisco have been prohibited since 2019 from using their cellphones while in school — from bell to bell. Schools nationwide, including some in Maryland, are now increasingly imposing such bans, but San Mateo was one of the earliest and largest schools in the country to implement a complete ban on cellphones during school hours.\nAt the start of each day, each of the 1,600 students lock their phone in a magnetically sealed pouch, created by the San Francisco-based company Yondr, that won’t be opened until the school day ends.\nThe decision to introduce Yondr pouches was the school’s attempt to tackle the increasingly pervasive effects of cellphone and social media overuse on its student body: cyberbullying, loss of sleep, self-esteem issues and endless distractions in class. \nTeachers and administrators quickly embraced the program, saying it restored their grasp on students’ attention in class. Some even said if the school were to end the program, they’d leave.\nAs schools around the country implement similar cellphone bans, San Mateo offers a six-year track record of how a cellphone ban can force young people to focus and, in many cases, feel better. \n“If schools can help alleviate some of those expectations and pressures about appearance and performance and embarrassment, and take away some of those elements that a lot of kids really struggle with and are confronted with, that is a benefit to them and to the school community and the school culture,” said Casey Teague, a longtime world history teacher at the school.\nA slow start\nThe decision to implement the Yondr program at San Mateo began with observation and a trial run.\nOne of its faculty members, Alicia Gorgani, observed a similar cellphone ban at San Lorenzo High School, a smaller school in the area, and brought the idea to San Mateo’s teachers and administrators.\nAdam Gelb, San Mateo’s assistant principal at the time, said seeing the cellphone ban in action at San Lorenzo “blew [his] mind.” \n“Students were engaged with one another,” he said. “They were interacting. They were playing card games. They were playing out on the yard. They were goofing around. They were in circles, talking to each other.”\nGelb helped bring the program to San Mateo, which tested Yondr pouches in a few classrooms in spring 2019.\nTeague, who’s worked at the school for more than 20 years, was one of those first instructors to pilot the program. He said he decided to try out the Yondr pouches in his class after noticing students’ smartphones were constantly bombarding them with notifications.\n“By 2018, every kid had a phone. That wasn’t anything new,” Teague said. “But the distracting nature of the phone was becoming more and more obvious.”\nSan Mateo health education teacher Brittany Dybdahl poses for a portrait on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nHealth education teacher Brittany Dybdahl said leading up to the ban, the school was seeing an increase in cyberbullying and drama stemming from online activities.\nEmbarrassing moments or conflicts among students had the risk of getting captured on video and being immortalized online.\n“It basically created way more opportunities for students to be emotionally impacted throughout the school day,” Dybdahl said. “And that would, of course, affect their academics and learning.”\nAfter the pilot program, and many discussions with students and their parents, San Mateo implemented the program schoolwide beginning in the 2019-20 academic year.\nSome teachers were apprehensive about the cellphone ban, thinking it would create more work for first-period teachers to check that each student had their phones sealed away. \nBut those checks quickly became part of the daily routine, said physics teacher Patrick Thrasher.\nAnd after seeing the impact the program had on their students, most faculty members got on board, Thrasher said.\n“There was such a pretty clear, drastic difference in the classroom,” he said. “It was just night and day.”\nSan Mateo’s cellphone ban was not even a year old when the COVID-19 pandemic moved all learning online for a year starting in March 2020. But the school decided to continue the cellphone ban when students returned to the classroom in 2021.\n“They do spend enough time already on screens that, you know, seven hours a day here at school [without screen time] is not going to kill them,” Shiu said.\nThe student reaction\nEnforcement of the ban hasn’t been entirely without issues. \nSan Mateo faculty members said some students — albeit a small percentage — are determined to bypass the Yondr pouches and keep their phones on them. Some put calculators, hard drives or other phone-shaped objects in their Yondr pouches. Others put old, unused “burner phones” in their pouches while keeping their personal phone on them.\nSan Mateo junior Lulu Bertolina poses for a portrait on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nBut many San Mateo students, like junior Lulu Bertolina, embraced the program. She said the Yondr program was one of the reasons she enrolled at San Mateo.\n“Having our phones [in Yondr pouches] made it easier to make friends, because I can’t go off on my phone and not make conversation with people,” she said. “It almost forced it — in a really good way.”\nFor San Mateo senior Siddharth Gogi, the absence of phones made the school feel more welcoming. He said students aren’t glued to their phones playing video games at lunch or distracted on social media in class.\n“Conversations move past surface level when you have that time to talk to one another,” said Gogi, San Mateo’s three-time class president who graduated this spring. \nHe acknowledged, though, that some students are concerned about not having quick access to their phones in case of an emergency.\nIn the early 2000s, many schools repealed their cellphone restrictions after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.\nBut Shiu said it’s better if students don’t have access to their phones during an emergency. The pouches prevent students and family members from sharing misinformation or flooding 911 with calls overwhelming first responders and the cellphone network.\n“In any emergency, we want students to be focused on the adult giving the information,” Shiu said.\nThe experts \nTo hear the experts tell it, there’s an overriding good reason for schools to ban cellphones. Cellphone use and social media sites can both have a serious impact on young peoples’ well-being. \nExtensive cellphone use during the day has a “direct correlation with a decline in mental health,” said Annette Anderson, the deputy director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.\n“We also know that cellphone use late into the evening has a disruptive factor in our young people getting enough sleep and then being attentive enough in the morning,” Anderson said.\nYoung people are grappling with the reality that the phone in their hand could be doing them harm. A Pew Research Survey released in April found almost half of U.S. teens age 13 to 17 agreed social media sites have a mostly negative impact on kids their age.  \nSan Mateo wellness counselor Helen Citrin poses for a portrait on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nSan Mateo wellness counselor Helen Citrin said a cellphone ban can provide students a much-needed break from their phones.\nFor students who are highly anxious or struggle managing their emotions, Citrin said, not having access to a cellphone can help as it prevents them from constantly texting their parents.\n“That pouch offers a boundary,” she said.\nOne recent study echoed this sentiment. Independent research on school cellphone bans is limited, but a 2024 study conducted by Yondr found that students saw a 15% increase in the likelihood they received a passing grade after their school implemented Yondr pouches. The report also found a 44% decrease in behavioral referrals after implementation.\nData from San Mateo paints a mixed picture of the school’s performance since implementation of the cellphone ban. Math and English test scores declined from 2019 through 2024, but both the graduation rate and preparedness for college and careers have inched upward. Meanwhile, the suspension rate increased.\nGelb offered an explanation for the rise: “Everybody was forced to communicate in person, so you had more people talking, and there’s more chance for someone to say the wrong thing or be in the wrong place.”\nBut, he added, the premeditated incidents and cyberbullying disappeared from the school day.\nA growing trend\nAlthough San Mateo might have been early to the cellphone ban movement, it’s among growing company now. \nState and local governments and school districts across the country are now considering — or have already passed — policies on cellphone use in school. Yondr boasts that millions of students from all 50 states are now using its pouches.\nA San Mateo High School student shows off a Yondr pouch on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nWhile there is no statewide ban in Maryland, more than a third of its public schools prohibit cellphone use, Capital News Service reported in October. Several school districts, including Howard and Baltimore counties, have passed a total ban. \nAbout 30% of U.S. schools now have a ban on cellphone use throughout the school day, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.  \nThat percentage is likely to rise. In the nation’s largest state, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation last year requiring all public and charter schools in California to create a policy to reduce or ban cellphone use during school hours by July 1, 2026, but left each school or school district to decide the specifics of their policy. \nAnd recently, New York joined the more than two dozen other states instituting a complete ban on cellphones during school hours.\nDemocratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said the decision comes as part of the state’s efforts to protect youth mental health.\n“Our young people succeed when they’re learning and growing, not clicking and scrolling,” Hochul said in a statement in May.\nA model to follow? \nSan Mateo faculty and staff said the school’s careful implementation of the Yondr program and the conversations it had with families and educators led to its success. \nBut several San Mateo faculty members said Yondr alone can’t solve youth mental health issues stemming from social media and personal devices. \nThe exterior of San Mateo High School on April 11, 2025. Since 2019, students at the school have been prohibited from using their phones during the school day. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nThe second students leave school grounds, they once again have access to their phones and can browse as much as they want. Citrin, the school’s wellness counselor, said many of the students she deals with stay up late into the night doomscrolling, or texting or video chatting with friends.\nThat being the case, Gelb said schools should also teach students how to develop a healthy relationship with their phone and social media.\nThe pouches also carry a financial impact on schools. \nEach student at San Mateo receives a free Yondr pouch at the beginning of the school year, but each replacement costs $15. In total, Shiu estimated the school spends about $20,000 a year on Yondr pouches.\nHowever, San Mateo teachers and administrators said the program’s benefits outweigh its costs.\n“From a school perspective, it keeps kids off of their phone during class time,” Citrin said. “Because the main focus here is education, that’s what the purpose is, and that’s what the use is benefiting.”",

    "content": "Karen Siska-Creel, Anne Arundel County’s school health and support director, knows from experience that if a problem pops up in the community, it won’t take long for it to appear in schools.\nWhen the opioid epidemic began to spread in Anne Arundel County around 2016, Siska-Creel  saw local fire departments establish pop-up stations to help people suffering from addiction. But it wasn’t until a high schooler pleaded with school nurses and the health department for help with their addiction that she realized the depth of need in the public school system.\n“The nurse tried and tried and tried — so did the school counselor — tried to plug this student into services. And we couldn’t do it,” Siska-Creel said. “The child left, was very upset, left, didn’t show up for two weeks, and had died of an overdose.” \nWithin the next year, Siska-Creel helped create the Screening Teens to Access Recovery Program in Anne Arundel County Public Schools. Called the STAR program, it’s a partnership with the county Department of Health that allows school nurses to pair middle and high schoolers with substance abuse treatment services. Siska-Creel said since its inception, about 50 students have been referred to services. \nFor Ryan Voegtlin, the assistant superintendent of student services at Anne Arundel County Public Schools, the program was born from a “gap in service” in substance abuse treatment for youth. \n“It’s no like we have hundreds of kids coming to access screening through the STAR Program every year,” Voegtlin said. “But it is an opportunity for them to get a screening and to get pointed in the right direction.”\nHow it works\nAbout a day after the STAR Program’s launch was announced, Siska-Creel said, a student walked into their school’s nurse’s office with a paper in hand.\n“‘My dad said to either get help or don’t come home,’” Siska-Creel recalls the student saying. \nThe youngster, who went to their nurse’s office, was then given an iPad in a private room, where they were connected to a licensed therapist and asked questions about their possible addiction or mental health struggles. The same process is used for any student in the program, Siska-Creel said. \nFrom there, the student will then receive a list of services, said Darin Ford, the program manager of the adolescents and family services division in the health department.\nThe STAR Program also requires a student’s consent for their parents or guardians to be told about them seeking services, Ford said. \n“It really creates a safe space for teens, for youth, to feel like they don’t have to worry about what others might be thinking about them. It’s all protected,” Ford said. “It’s really, especially during this day in age, for teens to know if they’re dealing with substance use or substance misuse, that there’s a safe space for them to go to get the help that they need.”\nThe health department will check in with a student who sought services a week after their screening to see if they contacted the resources or needed any others, Ford added. This way, the program provides treatment that lets students come when they need it — a strategy highly recommended when treating substance abuse, according to Jen Corbin, the director of Anne Arundel County’s crisis response. \nContinuing to push students to receive treatment could be read as applying too much pressure, Ford said.\nThe strategy — scientifically recognized as the Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment approach — is widely used to identify people who might show symptoms of addiction or possibility of developing an addiction in the future, according to the National Institute of Health. \nIt’s mainly used for youth and is expanding beyond doctors’ offices, an approach that studies in the Journal of Adolescent Health evaluated to be highly effective, especially once they’re added to schools. \n“When you ask the question, ‘What was the age that you first used the substance? What substance was it?’ Most of the gateway stuff was, ‘I used at 13, 14, 15,’” Corbin said of her screenings at Safe Stations, a program that she helped start that hosts mental health and substance abuse screenings in the county’s police and fire stations. “The conversation grew to, do we need to go back to making sure we’re educating our kids?” \nOrigin and limitations\nUnder the STAR Program, school nurses’ offices act as the safe stations where students can be connected to treatment, Corbin said..\n“When someone comes walking in, they’re more likely to grab the hand of the person out and say ‘Hey, I’m ready to get help,’ versus if I go to you and say ‘Hey, you overdosed, would you like help?’” Corbin said. “They may not be ready, they may not even want to talk to you, they may deny overdosing.”\nOther school systems, such as in King County, Washington state, have somewhat different programs. There, the Snoqualmie Valley School District administers screenings to all middle school students. \nFamilies are also able to withdraw their students from taking the screening, according to the district’s website. The same goes for some state-mandated programs, such as one established in Massachusetts in 2016. \nBut Anne Arundel County Public Schools are taking a different approach: one that relies on students to seek help.\n“There’s a balance in really respecting the student, just like you would respect an adult,” Ford said. “It’s really client-centered and motivated, versus directive.” \nDown to the numbers\nResearchers discovered that programs such as STAR are generally effective. In a Journal of Adolescent Health study conducted in 2022, researchers discussed student-based programs like STAR with 26 students in middle school — or grades six to eight — who had received screenings and interventions. The surveyed students overwhelmingly said they were satisfied with the approach, the study found.\nSharon Reif, a faculty member at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management in Massachusetts and lead author of another 2022 paper in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that screening and intervention services such as the STAR Program are typically low cost. \nBut her study also acknowledged the costs of these programs are generally unknown past being integrated into schools that can receive state or federal grant funding.\n“The issue is when you’re outside of those healthcare settings, insurance tends to actually say, ‘No, we’re not going to pay for things that are out there,’ even if they’re sort of healthcare,” Reif said. “And if you want to get kids, if you want to get youth, the healthcare setting is not the best place to get them, because they’re not there that often in the way that older people are.”\nThe implementation cost also depends on who conducts the screenings, Reif added. Having a doctor screen students is typically more expensive than having a school nurse or other aide do it, Reif said.\n“Having a doctor do something is very expensive, having a nurse is less expensive, having a PA or an aide is less expensive,” Reif said. “So it partly gets to that in terms of, how do you pay for it, and whose time is the most valuable?” \nSafe Stations is predominantly funded by grants from the Anne Arundel County Health Department, Corbin said. The STAR Program is also primarily funded by the department, as well as Anne Arundel County Public Schools for its middle school portion. \nA 2024 Maryland Community Health Resources Commission showed more than $6 million in grants allocated toward the Anne Arundel County Department of Health for Thrive Behavioral Health, one of the contracting services that conducts screenings for middle schoolers, along with other substance abuse grants.\n“It’s just continuing in getting the word out and figuring out where those gaps are and offering services,” Voegtlin said. “Definitely scouring for grants where we can find grants that meet our needs. That’s the name of the game right now.”\nAnne Arundel County has continued to increase funding for its Health Department. Its budget has increased by nearly 23% since fiscal 2023, according to county budget documents. \nMoving forward\nAbout 48.5 million people suffered from a substance abuse disorder in 2023, according to a survey conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nBut of that amount, just about 7.1 million people received treatment.\nThe state’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey does not track addiction, but it does study drug use by Maryland high school students. The latest survey, from the 2022-23 school year, showed 11.1% of high school students statewide had used prescription opioids without a prescription.  That’s down from 15.2% 10 years earlier, but drug abuse continues to be a grave concern for those who work with teens.\nFor Voegtlin, ensuring students know where the services are is most important for the program to grow, while also protecting students’ autonomy in the process.\n“It’s just kind of this balance,” Voegtlin said. “We want kids to come, but don’t want them to feel stigmatized about going there, right?”\nAs struggles with substance abuse evolve, Siska-Creel said she’s not sure where the STAR Program will grow, either. She focuses on the community to tell next steps about the program, she added.\n“It’s really what’s ever going on in the community,” Siska-Creel said. “I’ll see it in the schools. It eventually comes in.”",

    "content": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on April 22 about whether families have the right to excuse their children from public school lessons featuring books with LGBTQ+ themes.\nThe case, which originated in Maryland’s largest school system, raised a national debate of how schools will address religious and family rights in public education.\nMontgomery County Public Schools, a religiously diverse school system serving about 160,000 students, expanded its school curriculum in 2022 to include books featuring LGBTQ+ characters.\nSome Montgomery County schools allowed families to excuse their children from lessons where the books were read aloud. But in March 2023, the school system banned the opt-out policy and said parents would no longer be notified when the books were read.\nA group of Muslim, Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox parents then sued the system, arguing that their constitutional right to religion lets them pull children from lessons regarding gender and sexuality. After lower courts disagreed with the parents, they took their case to the higher court.\nThe targeted books in this case include titles such as “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” which features two men getting married and “Love, Violet,” which tells the story of a girl who develops a crush on a female classmate.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard more than two hours of arguments about the case on April 22. Many justices voiced that they had read through the books themselves.\nEric Baxter, the attorney representing the Montgomery County parents, said banning the opt-out policy violates parents’ ability to direct their children’s religious upbringing. In a school system where many students opt out of lessons daily for a variety of reasons, Baxter said, there is no basis for denying opt-outs for religious reasons.\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. emphasized that the school board is not required to change its curriculum, but simply provide an opt-out option for parents.\n“Why isn’t that feasible?” Alito said. “What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?”\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh, a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, said he is “mystified” how it came to this. Kavanaugh said he does not understand how an opt-out policy is not possible when every other school board in the county implements opt outs for a variety of reasons.\n“I’m just not understanding feasibility,” he said.\nKavanaugh expressed similar sentiments to Alito, stressing that parents are not asking the school board to change classroom instruction, but instead give their children the ability to be excused from certain lessons.\nJustice Elena Kagan said that she suspects many non-religious parents are not thrilled about the board’s revocation of the opt-out policy.\nBut Kagan also questioned the limits of implementing an opt-out policy. She asked if religious parents who objected to course material, regardless of their child’s age or the material’s content, would immediately receive an opt out.\n“It will be like opt outs for everyone,” Kagan said.\nAlan Shoenfeld, the attorney representing the school board, said children encounter ideas in the classroom daily that conflict with their religious beliefs, but learning about them does not burden free exercise of religion\nThe opt-out policy would require schools to find alternative classrooms, extra supervision and substitute lessons to accommodate students missing class, he added.\nLiberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson appeared to support the school board’s decision to eliminate the opt-out policy.\nSotomayor questioned if simply exposing children to books, such as by displaying them on library shelves or reading them to children, meant coercion.\nShe questioned how the court a should draw a line in terms of using religious grounds to opt children out of other lessons — including on topics such as evolution, interracial marriage and women’s rights. Sotomayor asked if schools must guess at what parents deem a violation of their religious beliefs.\nIn a White House briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said U.S. President Donald Trump “believes strongly that parents should have a greater say in their children’s education.”\n\n\nAbout 66% of Maryland voters said it is inappropriate for public school teachers to discuss acceptance of LGBTQ+ people with students in kindergarten to third grade, according to a 2022 survey of 810 voters conducted by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland.\nThe Supreme Court will release its final ruling on the case in June.",

    "content": "Malik Crozier, a 17-year-old football player from Brigham City, Utah, is a member of two teams.\nOne is the football team at Box Elder High School, where Crozier is a wide receiver. Another is NIL Club, a national online service that unites sports boosters and high school athletes around the United States. Last year, Crozier said, he received payments from NIL Club of approximately $100.\nCrozier said he and about thirty teammates have joined NIL Club. He refers to the company as “a fundraiser that your child gets to keep.”\n“This has definitely helped me with gas and extra school stuff,” he said.\nIn high school sports, getting paid isn’t prohibited for all athletes anymore. In 41 states and Washington, DC, athletic associations permit high school players to be compensated for use of their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL). They can profit from pitching products on social media, posing for selfies at a supermarket grand opening and a lot more.\nIn contrast, most high school associations ban collectives. Collectives pay athletes as NIL deals do but are different in that the money received comes from boosters and family members, among others.\n\n“ This has definitely helped me with gas and extra school stuff.”\n— Malik Crozier, high school football player, Brigham City, Utah\n\nAccording to the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association’s handbook, collectives are “groups of alumni, boosters, parents or other people that form a corporation, non-profit organization or other entity to facilitate NIL earnings for student-athletes at a specific school.”\nStates including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida have adopted rules to keep collectives out of high school sports. Officials voice concern that wealthy schools will form well-funded clubs and will dominate over teams with less money.\n“Collectives promote recruiting. We don’t want to see that within our schools. We don’t want to jeopardize the competitive nature of our athletics,” Mark E. Byers, Chief Operating Officer of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, told Capital News Service.\n\n“Collectives promote recruiting. We don’t want to see that within our schools.”\n— Mark E. Byers, Chief Operating Officer of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association\n\nAndrew Warner, Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association athletic director, noted that collectives raise concern for high school sports in part because, “They violate the separation between individual NIL and student-athlete attachment to schools.”\nIn contrast to high school rules banning them, collectives are an accepted part of college sports and can be a decisive factor in recruitment of top athletes. At three Power Four Conference schools — the University of Texas, Ohio State University and Louisiana State University — collectives distributed more than $20 million last year, according to 247sports.com.\nNIL Club doesn’t call itself a collective but operates like one in some basic ways, including the fact that it takes in money from donors and distributes it to athletes. On its website, NIL Club notes that it is different from collectives “as these [NIL Club] communities are run by students, not by adults or boosters.”\nNIL Club unites high school athletes with sports boosters but doesn’t label itself a collective. (Screenshot of NIL Club website)\nCrozier said he discovered the platform over the summer when a friend sent him a link. After joining, athletes like Crozier generate income by creating content such as photos and videos and sharing them to the website. NIL Club, created by a technology company called YOKE, charges a monthly fee for access to the player-generated content which is behind a paywall. Part of the subscription fees goes to players like Crozier.\nHow many high school and college players participate in NIL Club is difficult to determine. The homepage on NIL Club’s website refers to 250,000 “participating students.”\nMick Assaf, co-chief executive officer, said that NIL Club’s goal is to be “a helpful partner to the state associations.”\n“We believe the platform can help high school students and state associations better understand NIL as a whole,” Assaf said in an interview with CNS.\nMore stories: High School Sports & NIL: How dollars are changing the game\nNIL Club’s venture into high school sports has been rocky. Last year, Georgia’s High School Association issued a warning to players that if they signed up with NIL Club – and were paid by boosters for online content – they risked losing their sports eligibility, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\nIn 2024, the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association also singled out NIL Club for apparent violations of the state’s NIL policies.\nOn the NIL Club website, some students used labels that included school names and sports. TSAA noted that led to confusion about whether schools were sanctioning NIL activity, according to a report in The Tennessean. NIL Club also permitted students to upload photos wearing school uniforms with logos and the school name. That violated the state’s high school NIL policy about use of school intellectual property.\nAt Box Elder High School in Utah, Crozier believes in NIL Club. In fact, he wishes the company would do more to promote the football team’s presence on its website to fans and family members.\n“They would probably pledge more because a lot of them played for Box Elder,” he said.",

    "content": "After Achilles Bardos learned about the internet in the 1990s, he thought to himself, “Why not in psychology?”\nA school psychology professor, Bardos talked with his colleagues about using the web to quickly collect data on student behavior. A few years later, he and his colleagues created the Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System, or BIMAS. \n“It was identifying kiddos, students, through parents or through teacher ratings and the kids themselves who were able to tell us, ‘Hey, we are OK, some of us are not as OK and some of us really need lots of supports,’” Bardos said. \nThe BIMAS — now the BIMAS-2 —  is one of several behavioral health screenings used in schools throughout the United States. Yet amid a youth mental health crisis that, according to federal statistics, means 40% of high schoolers reported feeling sad or hopeless in 2023, computer-based mental health screenings remain fairly uncommon in America’s public schools. \nA 2021 survey found 12.8% of school districts that responded have policies calling for mental health screenings. Another study from that same year found only 5.4% of schools offered behavioral health screenings to all their students. \nBardos said no Maryland schools use his company’s screening tool. But other screening tools are in use in the state’s schools, said Sharon Hoover, co-director of the National Center for School Mental Health, which is based at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n“However, schools also may have concerns about being responsible for universal screening of students because they may then feel responsible for addressing any identified issues,” Hoover said. “Often schools do not have the resources to implement and respond to mental health screening, especially if done without community partnerships.”\nIn some cases, then, schools only use screening tools in particular grades. At the Green Bay Area Public School District in Wisconsin, for example, fifth- and eighth-graders are the only ones screened. Christina Gingle, a school official in Green Bay, said screenings the district uses allow staffers to more quickly identify students in need.\nShe said the BIMAS-2 “has greatly strengthened our ability to be able to support the mental wellness of our students.”\nWhat’s in a screening?\nBardos is now CEO of EduMetrisis, the company that publishes the BIMAS-2, which calls on respondents to fill out a 34-question form. The respondent can either be a teacher, a parent, the student themself or a combination of the three.\nBardos said schools can begin screening students as early as pre-K. The earlier a school implements screenings and follows up with the appropriate interventions, the better the outcome is going to be, he said.\nThe respondent fills out the form online and the responses are immediately collected in a database for school officials to examine. It takes about five minutes to fill out the form, Bardos said. \nThe form asks the respondent to rate whether the student has performed a specific behavior in the past week on a five-point scale from never to very often. The questions range from how often the student followed directions to how often they threatened or bullied others.\nAnother question asks students how often they have thought of hurting themselves. Bardos said that question gives the first initial indication that a student needs help. \n“It’s just a little opening to a box that says to you, ‘Please take a look at me,’” he said.\nAnother common behavioral health screening is the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment, or DESSA. \nThat screener evaluates students on six different competencies: optimistic thinking, relationship skills, self-management, responsible decision-making, social awareness and self-awareness.\nLike the BIMAS-2, respondents complete the DESSA online. Respondents can be students, teachers or parents. The respondent, like in the BIMAS-2, is asked how often the student performs a certain behavior on a five-point scale from never to almost always.\nSome of the questions include: “During the past four weeks, how often did the student keep trying when unsuccessful?” and “During the past four weeks, how often did the student believe they can achieve their goals?”\nThe DESSA groups students into three different categories based on how they respond to its questions: strength, typical and need for instruction — equivalent to above average, average and below average.\nThere are two versions of the DESSA. DESSA-mini is a shorter, eight-question form meant to serve as a benchmark for districts and help them gather information about the entire student body, said Evelyn Johnson, vice president for research at Riverside Insights, the company that publishes the screening tool.\nThe full DESSA assessment, which can evaluate individual students, has 40 questions. Middle and high school students can complete the assessment on their own.\nJust like Bardos’ test, the DESSA can be used with students in grades K-12.\nEquipped with information from the DESSA, “schools can start thinking about: How can I help this student build on the strengths they already are demonstrating to then develop skills in other areas that are going to serve them well?” Johnson said.\nScreenings in schools\nIn its screening guide, the National Center for School Mental Health recommends schools start small when they begin screening students — and that’s what the Green Bay area schools did.\nThe district is in its second year of implementing the BIMAS-2. Gingle, the district’s associate director of pupil services, said district officials favored a slow rollout to make sure they could address students’ concerns, especially if they mentioned self-harm.\nThe district chose to only screen students in the fifth and eighth grades because those are critical times in their lives — just before they transition from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school.\nGingle said the district created an intervention guide and conducted trainings for teachers, administrators and parents before implementing the screening tool. \n“I think it has been really well-received and [is] hopefully preventing any types of crises and keeping students in really that least restrictive setting to receive the level of needed care,” she said.\nIn Northern Virginia, Alexandria City Public Schools took a more comprehensive approach by screening all students from kindergarten to grade 12.\n“What we’re trying to do is identify those life skills students have already learned and things, but also try to enhance ones that might need to be developed as it relates to social emotional competencies,” said Victor Martin, the district’s executive director of student support teams.\nMartin’s district has been using the DESSA for three years. He said the district chose to use that screening tool because it measures social and emotional learning, or the process in which people develop their identities, manage their emotions and create relationships.\nThe district screens students twice a year. Teachers fill out a shorter assessment for students in kindergarten through eighth grade. It takes about two minutes to fill out the form for each student, Martin said.  \nIn high school, students complete a longer assessment on their own. It takes them about 20 minutes to complete, according to Martin. \nThe district then compiles the data and uses it to help its student support teams and teachers provide small group instruction, while other students may be referred for individual or online counseling.\n“Perhaps you might see that an entire grade level is maybe struggling with relationship skills, and maybe that’s an opportunity for us, in collaboration with the classroom teacher, to work on providing lessons that might help with building relationship skills,” Martin said. \nUsing that approach, some schools in the district have seen entire grade levels improve from the fall assessment to the spring assessment.\n“We’ve seen students improve to a strengths-based level because of strategies and interventions that have been put in place by those schools,” Martin said.\nA reluctance to screen\nStudents in Green Bay and Alexandria can opt out of the screenings if their parents prefer — but elsewhere, many school districts are entirely opting out of behavioral health screenings, or limiting their use, for a number of reasons.\nA 2023 poll published in Phi Delta Kappan found the public has mixed views on mental health assessments in schools. Of those that responded to the survey, 45% said schools should assess students only when their parents or guardians request it, 39% said schools should assess all students and 14% said schools should not assess students.\n\nSometimes school officials worry parents are going to be upset if their children are screened, said Elizabeth Connors, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.\nShe said that worry is often unfounded. “I don’t think there’s often that much resistance, but it certainly does happen,” she said. “So that’s why we encourage schools to be reaching out to their parents.”\nYet the screenings have caused a stir in some places. When Wake County schools in North Carolina implemented the BIMAS-2, some parents objected to the idea that teachers would be evaluating the behavioral health of their students.\n“I don’t think it’s fair to put the teachers in the position to have to analyze the students in this way,” Rachael Ayscue, the parent of a high schooler, told ABC11 in Raleigh-Durham in 2019. “They’re educated in the curriculum that they’re teaching, not in behavioral science.”\nStudents sometimes object to the screenings, too. In 2022, Isaiah Steinberg, at the time a student at Jamesville-Dewitt High School in upstate New York, wrote an essay criticizing the BIMAS-2 in the school newspaper, the RamPage. He said students were reluctant to complete the screening, and for a good reason.\n“The truth is that J-D students are nervous that they will be singled out by their counselors and administrators, people who they often do not know or trust very well,” Steinberg wrote.\nAnother potential limitation of mental health screenings is the cost. For example, it would cost a school district the size of Green Bay over $70,000 each year to use the BIMAS-2.\nSigns of success\nThere’s evidence, though, that the screenings do some good.\nA March 2025 study by University of Nebraska researchers found the BIMAS-2 “effectively identifies at-risk students, offering an effective approach to addressing adolescent mental health needs in rural communities.”\nAnd a 2017 study of low-income kindergarteners evaluated with the DESSA found the screening accurately evaluated their self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making.\nBoth Gingle and Martin mentioned screenings are just one data point they look at when they consider a child’s mental well-being.\nMartin said Alexandria schools wouldn’t automatically put a child into therapy based on the results of the screening. “We would take that in consideration with attendance and grades and disciplinary reasons and concerns from the teacher,” he said.\nConnors said that’s the right approach. She likens mental health screenings to vision screenings in schools. \n“Just because you, you know, fail that vision screening, it doesn’t mean that you need glasses. You actually need to go to the optometrist, and they’re going to have sharper tools there,” she said. \nA lower score on the screening just means that school officials should follow up with those students and understand whether the student would benefit from some kind of service, she added. \nDespite the occasional concerns of parents and students elsewhere, Gingle and Martin said the response from parents to the screenings in their schools has been positive. Both said their districts have made sure to do outreach to parents to make sure they understand the screenings and how they are conducted.\nConnors said when school districts start doing mental health screenings, they begin to understand their students have a lot of mental health needs that, without screenings, may have gone unnoticed. \n“Once you identify one student who otherwise might have fallen through the cracks, you realize how essential this is to supporting student mental health and well-being and success,” Connors said.\nClarification: An earlier version of this story said DESSA had 72 questions, but that was for the assessment’s previous version. The updated version of DESSA includes 40 questions, and the story has been edited to reflect that fact.",

    "content": "PHILADELPHIA — You won’t find swings, slides or a kickball field outside Rhawnhurst School. Instead, the school’s “playground” is a vast expanse of barren blacktop with just a lone basketball hoop.\nYet at this aging two-story elementary school in this deeply diverse Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood, play is not just encouraged, but deeply embedded in the school’s culture. \nFor the past six years, Rhawnhurst has partnered with Playworks, a national nonprofit dedicated to enhancing children’s well-being by engaging them in safe, meaningful play. The program targets life skills that are important to the children’s academic success. \n“At this age, play is a foundation,” said Samiyah Saunders, Rhawnhurst’s in-house Playworks staffer, known to students as Coach Samiyah. “They learn through play.”\nThe 23-year-old Playworks coach, often called the school’s celebrity, spends two weeks each month leading the children in games like duck, duck, goose and human knot. What the kids don’t realize is that Saunders’ structured recess games teach them lessons in confidence, conflict resolution and inclusivity.\nPlayworks officials believe recess — often regarded as a way for kids to burn energy — can help students learn and mature.\n“Children have the right to play, and it’s the language that they understand,” said Tia Mathisen,  Playworks’ Pennsylvania executive director. “It’s the language that they learn through the best across cultural/language barriers.” \nSince its founding in 1996, Playworks has partnered with more than 3,000 schools nationwide. During the 2023-24 school year, the organization was active in more than 1,300 schools, and thanks to a $295,000 state grant, Playworks is now active in Maryland, in Anne Arundel County elementary schools.\nThe Playworks approach seems to work, both nationally and at Rhawnhurst.\nAt schools implementing Playworks, teacher-reported rates of bullying and exclusionary behavior were 43% lower compared to schools not using the program, according to an evaluation  by Mathematica Policy Research and the John W. Gardner Center in 2013. And a 2017 Rand Corp. review found that Playworks boosted student behavior, class readiness and safety while cutting down on bullying.\nAt Rhawnhurst, “once Playworks started, there was so much less fighting and arguing, and they were actually playing games that they enjoyed to play and it kept them busy,” said Michelle Bernardi, a fifth grade teacher at the school. “It was just a wonderful difference.”\nGame Time \nRhawnhurst’s recess may look like typical elementary school chaos — with kids running, shouting and playing — but underneath the noise is structure. Students know the expectations, and they’re given clear choices: a variety of games to join if they so choose. \nAt the start of each 20-minute recess, students line up in single file and listen closely for their “repeat after me” instructions, a set of expectations focused on playing safely, including others and showing respect on the blacktop. \nRecess staff or older student mentors then present the games they will be running that day, whether it’s monkey in the middle, soccer or something new. \n“It’s an open recess with more options,” said Sean Finn, the school’s guidance counselor. \nThird graders at Rhawnhurst School play “human knot” during recess. (Christina Walker/Capital News Service)\nPlayworks also introduced Class Game Time into the school day. During her two weeks on site, Saunders pulls nearly every class, along with their teachers, outside for 35 minutes to learn a new game. \n“Instead of the teachers sitting off to the side on their phones, on their computer doing work, they’re involved directly in the games,” Finn said. “They’re running and playing and jumping through hula hoops and racing.”\nThat approach strengthens relationships among teachers and students, Bernardi said.\n“[During class games] you can just talk to them on a different level,” she said. “They might bring up something that you wouldn’t have a chance to talk with them about in class.”\nAll the play at Rhawnhurst also depends on “climate staff:” employees who manage students’ lunch periods and recess, giving teachers a break. These staffers also often step in as teacher aides and handle conflicts.\n“The staff have bought in,” Rhawnhurst principal  Joy Kingwood-Ellis said. “Climate staff really need to be developed, and they want to be treated like professionals, and I think Playworks really gives them a template to work from.”\nThe Playworks approach includes conflict resolution tools for students, which are important because many student spats tend to arise in the recess yard, Mathisen said.\nBut staffers said kids are increasingly able to manage their own disagreements.\nRoshambo, or more commonly known as rock-paper-scissors, is Playworks’ — and now Rhawnhurst’s — preferred way to settle an argument. It may sound simple, but the staff at Rhawnhurst said the students view it as fair and use it often with or without adult intervention.\n“We work with kids to help give them agency on, ‘what does it look like when there is a conflict? How do you resolve that?’” Mathisen said.  \nFewer conflicts \nSince introducing Playworks, Rhawnhurst has seen a transformation in school climate, marked by fewer conflicts and almost no bullying, according to teachers and staff. Kingwood-Ellis said she hasn’t suspended a student in years.\n“This office has seen drastically less incidents of conflicts,” Finn said. “We got it out of our system [during recess], we were able to connect with friends, you know, connect with an adult, and get whatever we need kind of out of our system and reset ourselves.” \nBut Rhawnhurst, an elementary school with more than 600 students, is not a typical Playworks school. \nRhawnhurst has partnered with Playworks for more than six years, and a Playworks staff member is on-site for 40 hours per month. Typically, Playworks aims to make its program sustainable and self-sufficient, often staying for a few years until the school can maintain the practices independently. \nThis has not yet happened at Rhawnhurst, which hosts a large number of immigrant and refugee students. More than 27 languages can be heard in the school’s hallways, but Playworks officials said their program helps break down those language barriers. \n“[Rhawnhurst] just loves us,” Mathisen said. “Because of the different languages that they have, they are a unique case, and they can see truly the benefit of how play really has infused with their school and how kids are able to connect and really make progress and friends so much faster despite the language barriers.” \nFinn noted the program has also contributed to improved attendance, as students are eager to participate in recess and class game time.\nElsewhere, many teachers struggle to manage behavior in the classroom. A 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 68% of elementary school teachers report dealing with behavior issues daily. The same percentage indicated they have experienced verbal abuse from students, while 55% have encountered physical violence.\nBut things are different at Rhawnhurst.\nFinn said thanks to Playworks, students with trauma or behavioral challenges often become better at self-regulating and managing their emotions. \n“We want to continue that relationship [with Playworks], because we’re always evolving with our immigrant and refugee population, but we’re also evolving as professional educators here,” Finn said. “It’s invaluable to our school climate.” \n‘Junior coaches’ \nFor some of Rhawnhurst’s students, recess isn’t just playtime — it’s a job.\nOut on the schoolyard, you can find a select group of fourth and fifth graders leading the younger students during recess, sometimes wearing their official purple Playworks T-shirts and blowing their whistles. They raise their voices to announce which games are available that day, take charge of the activities and ensure the games run smoothly while adults focus on safety.\nThese fourth and fifth graders are part of the Junior Coaches Program, where they take on shifts throughout the week to help guide recess for kindergarten through second grade. In the process, they build leadership skills and confidence that extend far beyond the playground.\n“We can inspire kids and we can prove that we’re responsible,” said Rayanne Musa, a fourth-grade student in the program.   \nJunior Coach Gracious Gray, a fifth grader at Rhawnhurst School, leads a game of Monkey in the Middle during recess for the younger grades. (Christina Walker/Capital News Service)\nFinn oversees the 18 junior coaches at Rhawnhurst.\n“There’s a real social-emotional component to having them grow as leaders, practicing being assertive and not aggressive on the playground or not passive on the playground, collaborating, cooperating with each other,” Finn said. “These are our future leaders.” \nWhile the junior coaches lead many of the recess games, Saunders can focus on identifying students who don’t have anyone to play with or those who want to try a different game than what was originally offered. \nLeen Tay, a fourth-grade junior coach at Rhawnhurst, said having students like her out on the playground is especially important for the younger kids. Coaches are more than role models; they can also be friends who feel more approachable and trustworthy than adults.\n“When we play with them … they feel like they have someone they can trust,” Tay said. “When I play with them I understand how they feel.”\n‘An important time’\nWhile Playworks has had a noticeable impact at Rhawnhurst, even its supporters acknowledge it may face challenges at other schools. \nFor one thing, Playworks isn’t free. The organization said establishing its Playworks coach service typically costs between $60,000 and $65,000 per school, although schools with more than half their students on free or reduced-price lunches are eligible for a subsidy that pays up to 50% of the costs.\nIn schools without climate staff, implementing Playworks could be more difficult. That’s because in such schools, Playworks puts more pressure on teachers to participate in training and recess, all on top of their existing responsibilities.\n“[Having climate staff] builds more support and more community,” Saunders said. “If you’re putting so much on a teacher, they’re not giving 100% in the places that matter.”\nHowever, many schools across the nation with Playworks do not have climate staff. \n“Playworks works best with any school that has full buy-in,” Mathisen said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a teacher or school aid or climate staff.” \nIn addition, not everyone agrees on how structured play should be. A 2020 study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found “unstructured play in addition to mindfulness intervention is effective in promoting students’ happiness and playfulness, both of which may help maintain mental health and well-being.” However, that study also noted unstructured play led to increased disruptive behavior.\n“There are people who really feel like play should be kind of free from adults and rules,” said Geetha Ramani, a human development professor at the University of Maryland’s College of Education. “I take a little bit of a … different feel about that, because I think that you can have sort of structured or guided play and have it be really rewarding and meaningful to the kids and still be an opportunity for it to be playful.”\nRamani stressed recess gives children time to refocus and prepare for the classroom.\n“[Recess is] a really important time,” Ramani said. “We’re seeing recess time often kind of being decreased, but it’s really important to maintain that time, otherwise it’s going to be hard for children to sort of stay focused for long periods of time.” \nTargeting play is potentially a piece of the solution to the nation’s growing behavioral problems in elementary schools, the professor said. \n“Play becomes really important, both kind of free and structured play,” Ramani said. “So … [students] have opportunities to learn in ways that may be more age-appropriate, and so I think, you know, targeting play as a potential way to help is important.”\nGracious Gray, fifth grader and junior coach at Rhawnhurst, said the program lets her feel like a big sister and brings back memories of her own younger days. \nShe said for some of the younger students, the extra support Playworks provides on the playground can make all the difference.\n“There’s kids that don’t really have anyone to play with. … I can step in and play with them and make them feel wanted,” Gray said. “It’s my responsibility to influence little ones so they could be like us one day and be kind people.”",

    "content": "Listen to this story:\n\nMaryland’s high school graduation rate climbed to 88% in 2024, reaching its highest point since 2017, according to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.\nThe 2024 data from MSDE shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points from 2023-2024, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.\n“Last year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that’s a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,” said Theresa Timmons Parrott, an MSDE official focused on multilingual education. “It’s a step in the right direction, but it’s not the finish line.”\n\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools reported a graduation rate of 89%, two percentage points above the state average. North County High School in Glen Burnie, a Title I school, achieved a 7% increase in its graduation rate.\nBob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, said “every student group is different, and so it’s providing students with what it is that they need on an individual basis to be successful.”\n“A nearly full-point jump in overall graduation rate is a very significant accomplishment,” said Mosier. “We also had six schools that increased by two percentage points or more.”\n﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\nMosier credited the district’s progress in part to Project Graduation, a systemwide initiative launched two years ago to provide tailored support to students at risk of not finishing high school on time.\n“It really is a laser-like focus on individual students and what those students need in order to graduate, graduate on time,” Mosier said about the project. “We put that in place two years ago, … and we’re starting to see that pay off now.”\nIn Baltimore City, the four-year graduation rate rose by one percentage point for the 2023 graduating class. MSDE said the district focused on ninth-grade intervention and reducing chronic absenteeism, two predictors of long-term academic success. According to MSDE’s public dataset, Baltimore also saw improved outcomes among English language learners and students experiencing homelessness.\nStatewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students’ graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.\nThe graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps. Several of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint — including community school models and increased funding for English language learners — align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.\n“If you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we’re seeing pay off,” Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by tenth grade.\nWhile the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future has driven recent graduation gains, lawmakers enacted adjustments this year due to a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, passed in April 2025, includes a three-year delay in implementing teacher collaborative time and provisions to freeze increases in funding if state revenues significantly decline.​\nStill, regional disparities persist. While some districts reported graduation rates above 90%, others, particularly in rural counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, sit at 80% and below. Education advocates say these gaps underscore the need for continued investment and monitoring.\n﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n“This is great news for Maryland,” State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright said in a press release from MSDE. “When we set high standards, deliver strong instruction, and invest in proven supports, our students show that they will exceed expectations.”\nAs the 2025 graduating class enters its final year, educators and policymakers are cautiously optimistic. The latest data suggests that Maryland’s post-pandemic recovery is underway, however state education officials say it will require long-term commitment to equity, funding and student support services to maintain.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS — Maryland mental health advocates and providers are relieved coming out of this year’s legislative session, where state lawmakers decided against a drastic cut in funding to the state’s year-old, big-money program aimed at improving the mental health of its young people.\nThe Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, created under the state’s ambitious and expensive education reform plan called the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, will receive $70 million from the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget to award mental health providers in its second round of grants. That’s up from the $40 million Gov. Wes Moore originally suggested spending. \nBut with some money left over from funding this past fiscal year, the consortium plans to allocate closer to $98 million in grants. Legislators previously allocated $119.7 million over two years to set up the consortium and issued its first $111 million of grants in February 2024.\nPartly as a result of those grants, more than 80% of Maryland public schools now have some sort of mental health service available for students. And mental health advocates said the additional funding means the state’s effort will continue to reach a large percentage of the state’s children.\n“This is a critical investment that’s ensuring students in every corner of our state have the resources and support necessary to learn and thrive,” said Dan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland. “We couldn’t be happier.”\nThe consortium provides mental health funding for dozens of services, including in-school counseling, substance abuse treatment and peer support groups for families and students. \nBut at the beginning of this year’s difficult legislative session where the General Assembly would have to fill a $3 billion budget hole, Moore proposed a spending plan that allocated only $40 million to the youth mental health effort — even though he once proposed the program should receive $130 million for fiscal year 2026. \nThe General Assembly, however, passed a bill on the last day of the legislative session that added $30 million to the youth mental health budget on top of what Moore had proposed, leaving many relieved for the future of the program. \nSen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat representing Montgomery and Howard counties, said this decision was crucial for the future of the consortium and the youth mental health programs it funds.\n“I think when you’re trying to address the mental health needs of the entire state, you can’t really do it piecemeal,” Hester said. \nIf funding for the consortium had been limited to the amount suggested in Moore’s budget, “you would have to redo the entire program,” Hester added.\nThe consortium’s grant allocations are designed around a “hub and spoke” model that aims to include community organizations in the program. The hubs, or organizations already established in Maryland’s counties, including churches and community centers, help promote and run the services of the spokes, or mental health programs. Both are funded through consortium grants.\n“The hub and spoke model would not have worked at $40 million,” Hester said.\nWhile the community organizations are in different stages of operation in each county, Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, said the funding provided will allow for the program to move closer to full implementation this upcoming year.\nLuckner said a good number of active service providers have applied for the second round of funding, which the consortium is expected to issue by June 30. \nThe initial 127 grants were projected to serve about 150,000 people, “and they’re well on their way to do that globally,” Luckner said at Thursday’s consortium meeting. \nLuckner said he believes within two years, as many as 22 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions will either have a fully operational or almost fully operational youth mental health hub.\n“We should just take a moment and celebrate that accomplishment that the consortium is achieving,” Luckner said. \nService providers agree. Jan Guszynski is the project manager for Prosper, an app that, under Uneo Health, provides mental health check ins-for adolescents. The app received $1.4 million grants to provide services in Prince George’s, Frederick and Calvert counties.  \nBefore the legislation was passed confirming $70 million in consortium funding for fiscal year 2026, Guszynski said she was worried for the future of not only mental health services but for the students using them.\n“I really, really hope that we do not see these resources shuttered or too heavily impacted as time goes on,” Guszynski said. “Because it’s hugely important.”\nThose resources won’t likely get shuttered or too heavily impacted if the General Assembly sticks with the outline it set in the budget it just passed, which projects $100 million in youth mental health funding in fiscal year 2027 and $100 million annually after that.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Jaden Smith, a second-year master’s student in social work at Howard University, is already doing something not enough people do. He’s working in a public high school, offering what he calls “big brother love” to his students. \nSmith, who started work at Bard High School Early College DC in Southeast Washington last fall while completing his degree, said he’s now doing the same “noble” work that his mother did: serving as a school social worker.\nAnd thanks to a Howard program that aims to place social work students in schools in hopes that they’ll work there full-time when they graduate, others are doing similar work. In the program’s first two years, 22 second-year master’s students have been placed in schools in the nation’s capital to increase and diversify the school social work labor force, especially where they are needed the most.\nIt’s called Project PRESS, which stands for Preparing Responsive and Effective School Social Workers. And the pilot program addresses a pressing need: a shortage of social workers in schools both in D.C. and nationwide. \nWhen Project PRESS started in 2023, there were 95 school social worker vacancies in D.C. public schools, said Sandra Jeter, an assistant professor of social work at Howard, at a panel about the project in December. And according to the School Social Work Association of America, no state in the union meets the recommended benchmark of one social worker for every 250 students.\nJeter, who launched Project PRESS with a five-year, $2.6 million federal grant, said social work programs at other universities could establish similar efforts to address the nationwide shortage of school social workers. \n“I think PRESS can definitely be a model or just be an organization that offers this training to different universities that are developing social workers, whether they have a school social work focus or not,” Jeter said. “I think any university can adopt this model or work with me on expanding the model.” \nIntensive training\nProject PRESS aims to motivate social work students to do something many of their predecessors have decided not to do: work in schools.\n“The Project PRESS program is a really exciting thing to see to get students excited about the school social work profession,” said Allie Perez, a representative of the School Social Work Association of D.C. \nThis yearlong program puts Howard social work students through two weeks of intensive training before they are placed at one of 11 participating schools. Students in the program receive a $10,000 stipend to ease some of the financial stresses of placement in a city school. \nSocial workers have different responsibilities than counselors and school psychologists. School social workers tend to work with specific students for long periods of time and create treatment or action plans.\n“We do the mental health support, but we also take a more systemic view and we really focus on connecting people to resources and helping them remove barriers to those resources,” Perez said.\nSchool counselors are more likely to focus on academic and career development compared to school social workers that are helping students with socio-emotional challenges. \nA school psychologist has the ability to diagnose students and perform psychosocial assessments, Jeter said. \nThe services that a school social worker provides, especially to underserved students, have a trickle-down effect on how a student performs, said Gloria Cain, an assistant professor at Howard’s School of Social Work and a faculty member with Project PRESS. \n“Social work is a discipline that really focuses on individuals within the context of their environment,” Cain said. \nThe need \nProject PRESS focuses on sending students to D.C.’s Wards 7 and 8, historically Black and low-income areas located south of the Anacostia River.\nJeter said she believes these areas not only lack investment from the city but lack support rooted in the Black perspective that focuses on issues and trauma people often experience in majority Black and low-income communities. \nThe program focuses on culturally responsive training, which prepares program participants to engage with different student populations. It also teaches trauma-informed training, which promotes awareness of the systemic and individual trauma students carry with them so the student is not retraumatized. \nRacist incidents, poverty, food insecurity and homelessness are just some of the traumas students can carry with them that impact their performance in school. A main goal of the program is to interrupt these factors and use education as a gateway to success, Cain said.\nKyaus Washington, a 2024 graduate of Howard’s master of social work program, said it’s important for social workers to know when students have experienced such traumas.\n“Traumatic events happen to people and whenever you kind of understand that and try to understand from the person’s perspective, then you’re able to kind of tailor your modality to be effective based on the traumatic experience,” Washington said. \nWashington works as a school-based expansion clinician at Lorraine H. Whitlock Elementary School in Ward 7. He noted negative experiences with therapists and the nation’s long history of medical racism can lead to a sense of relief when a young Black student sees a Black social worker.\n“People automatically have this shared sense of community with each other,” Washington said. “If they see, you know, me, a Black man walking into the school, my Black male students could automatically connect with me from that one shared identity.” \nMore from Youth mental health: What works?\nContinued barriers\nWashington keeps fidget toys and Play-Doh in his office to create a safe and fun place for students to come as a reward for good behavior.\n“Students tend to like to come to my office because other people in the building are relatively hard on them,” he said. “And I’m like that safe space where you can always come in here and hang.” \nWashington is among the 60% of program participants that were hired in D.C. public schools after their participation in Project PRESS. Many other students are looking to apply in schools but are facing issues with licensure, a barrier reflected across the country for Black social work students. \nA 2022 report from the Association of Social Work Boards reported a 45% pass rate of the licensing exam for Black participants compared to 84% of white participants.  Jeter said Project PRESS hopes to address this licensure gap through a prep course taught by Washington, along with other resources provided to students. \nSocial work students in Project PRESS are required to work at least 20 hours per week at their placement on top of their graduate coursework. Washington and Smith said this workload was manageable, but mentioned other students in their program felt burnout from the work. \nIn their  students’ training weeks, they were taught mindfulness exercises and yoga to find ways to relax and have been offered other resources of support. \nWhile at their placements, program participants are able to complete case consultations with school students, parents and teachers to address the broader issues impacting a student’s performance. They also act as sources of support for students in their caseload. Smith has helped his students find jobs or add others to his caseload if they regularly come to his office. \n“When you consistently show up for them and invest in them truly, I feel like we’re going to really reap the benefits of all that as a society,” Smith said. \nProject PRESS solely focuses on master’s degree students who are interested in school social work. Jeter only selects second-year graduate students for this program as she said they know where they want to be. \n“We can’t just go there and get this experience and leave. It’s important for us to become a part of the community,” Jeter said. “Our students should become a part of the community even after they graduate.”\nWhile Smith entered the master’s program unsure of becoming a school social worker, he is now planning on working in D.C. public schools after he graduates. \nHe sees the pipeline between Howard and D.C. public schools as necessary to give students the services that they need. \n“There’s so much negative stuff, like spewing the news and stuff like that, about what was going on with the youth and everything, but there hasn’t been a lot of people who’ve been willing to offer solutions and be action-oriented,” Smith said. \nNext steps\nOne major roadblock could stand in the way of Project PRESS, however: the Trump administration’s ban on funding for programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.\nJeter said she hasn’t heard anything about the program’s federal grant being suspended. And while a federal lawsuit has temporarily put the DEI ban on hold, she remains worried.\n“If funding cuts continue, we will have even fewer resources for vulnerable and marginalized populations, less supportive programs like Project PRESS that aim to support students pursuing careers in the helping profession like social work and education, and more strain on an already overwhelmed social services system,” Jeter said. \nSandra Jeter, an assistant professor at Howard University’s School of Social Work and the creator of Project PRESS, poses for a portrait. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nFaculty and students alike hope for the continuation of this program.   \n“For you to have something stable and consistent structured, it kind of puts your mind at peace when you have all this other school stuff to worry about,” Smith said. \nA survey completed by the first-year cohort revealed 100% of respondents reported the training effectively prepared them for the hiring process and their work in schools, Jeter said. She said she believes this is a clear demonstration of how the program is accomplishing one of its goals: supporting students. \nAnother goal of Project PRESS is to see if the work students are doing in their placements is having a trickle-down effect on issues like tardiness or school suspensions, Cain said. \nThis program is close to Jeter’s heart, not only for her attachment to D.C. public schools but for what the program can mean for future generations. \n“My nephews and nieces are being educated in D.C. schools now, and so I know when I was younger and experienced anxiety and depression I didn’t have a social worker,” Jeter said. “I’m happy that I’m a part of the process to get at least my niece and nephew support if they would ever need it.”",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — Under the scorching sun and dressed in her corporate blouse and skirt, Sarah Newman sat on the stairs leading up to the Department of Education’s entrance. \n“I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong by spending time at the place I otherwise would have been at on a Wednesday,’’ Newman said. A green work bag containing books and an office laptop stood beside her.\nThe department closed its headquarters building in Washington as well as regional offices on Wednesday, but Newman sat on the stairs from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. to protest her job loss. \nNewman, who lives in northern Virginia and worked with the department for 13 years, was part of staff that faced layoffs on Tuesday that impacted nearly a half of the department’s workforce — a reduction from 4,133 to 2,183 workers, according to the agency’s website. \nNewman worked with the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education under the department. Her work entailed administering grant programs to support students from pre-K to 12th grade, and collecting and analyzing data on student performance, testing and graduation rates to ensure the grant programs’ effectiveness. \nNewman said “it feels unjust” losing her job, but while she worries about her future and braces herself for the start of her administrative leave on March 21, she is most fearful of the impacts the staff reduction will have on students.\n“I worry about the persistent kind of inequality that we continue to see,” Newman said. “Kids aren’t getting the same experience as one another and I really worry that it will get significantly worse.”\nWASHINGTON – Two women stand outside of the Department of Education on Wednesday, protesting cuts made to that agency’s workforce. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nThe department’s Office of Civil Rights also faced layoffs on Tuesday, eliminating the entire investigative staff in seven of its 12 regional branches. The civil rights branch is responsible for ensuring equal access to education, prohibiting discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal funds and investigating civil rights violations in schools across the nation.\nThe Department of Education’s other functions include managing federal loans for college, distributing Pell grants, supporting programs for students with disabilities, providing funding to high-poverty schools and supporting students and schools affected by natural disasters.\n“The Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students and competitive grantmaking,” according to a statement from the agency.\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon, nominated by President Donald Trump, said in a statement that the staff reduction “reflects the Department of Education’s commitment to efficiency, accountability and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents and teachers.” \nBut Joe Murphy, who was let go on Tuesday after working at the department for 10 years, said the firing of workers will have a noticeable impact.\n“I’m very afraid that with the elimination of all of the people within these offices in the department, the delivery of the resources to the grantees, those being the states, is going to be delayed or cut off completely,” he told Capital News Service. “If they (the Trump administration) can’t get the grants out at all, and if it’s their goal to save money and stop these grants, that’s against what is written into law by Congress.”\nMurphy, from Dumfries, Virginia, worked as a management and data analyst and carried out duties similar to Newman’s. He said working with the department was rewarding. He reminisced about the time he worked on a project that gave grants to Native American students. \n“It was unbelievably gratifying,” Murphy said. “Because we took a population that is frequently underserved in terms of resources, and it gave us a way of proving that they need more resources.”\nMembers of the public dropped by the department’s building Wednesday to express their dismay about the Trump administration’s actions.\nPeople posted signs around the department’s granite garden bed that read “Department of Education is not a ‘Bureaucratic Bloat,’” referencing a statement McMahon made Tuesday on Fox News. Other posters read, “Employers want to hire an educated workforce,” “You did NOT keep ‘all the right people’ … You kept Elon!”\nLesley Fera, who previously worked as a substitute teacher, flew from Los Angeles to Washington to protest against the downsizing of various federal agencies under Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Fera said she wanted to show solidarity with workers from the department.\n“I can’t see how this does not affect education and accessibility to education when people are relying on the public school system,” said Fera, who wore a red shirt that read: “Stop the billionaire coup.”\n“My heart is with education and the programs that will be decimated because of this,” she said.\nKaren Sandoe, a retired teacher who taught in southwest Virginia for 30 years and comes from a family of four generations of educators, sat beside a poster she made that said: “(Re) Tired teacher supporting Dept. of Ed.”\n“When history reflects on this, and it will,” Sandoe said, “I want my grandchildren to know that their grandmother stood up for education and for their future.” \nNewman, still sitting on the stairs, sipped from a cup of coffee to get her through the day.\n“This place has been my home away from home,” Newman said about the Education Department. “I feel like I’ve created this life for myself, and I’m proud of that. It feels under attack.”",

    "content": "POCOMOKE CITY, Md. — Worcester County’s Pocomoke High School opened its doors as usual to 352 students on a bright but chilly Thursday last December. A mix of mellow pop hits played in the background, and students at the school made their way to their first-period class welcomed by staffers with smiles and hellos.  \nThe scene in this small town in the southernmost part of Maryland’s Eastern Shore clashed with the image of a modern high school rife with rifts and cliques. That’s because the school welcomes all students and treats them with respect, Pocomoke senior Josie Stevens said. \n“Every day I get to come in and everyone’s already in a good mood,” said Stevens, who is active in the school’s Marine Corps Junior ROTC program.\nFor Principal Jenifer Rayne, this positive environment is a result of the school’s adoption of “restorative practices,” a social science technique that downplays traditional discipline methods such as suspensions in favor of building meaningful relationships among students and teachers. \nPocomoke High School Principal Jenifer Rayne. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nIn Worcester County, restorative practices appear to be working. District officials credit restorative practices with creating an atmosphere that led to a 28% drop in violent incidents across all schools in the past year.\nWith a majority-minority population and 70% of the student body listed as economically disadvantaged by U.S. News & World Reports, Pocomoke High School is breaking all academic odds. The school is currently tied for the highest graduation rate in Maryland, according to U.S. News & World Report rankings. The class of 2024 achieved a 100% graduation rate.\nRayne attributed the school’s success to its collaborative culture.\n“We don’t need to feel like we have to protect ourselves here,” Rayne said. “We feel accepted, and there is a community-wide goal, including the students, to make sure that our school stays a safe place.”\nBackground and beginnings\nRestorative practices are based on the principle that conflict impacts the school community as a whole, so it must be resolved by community-building measures. \nFormer Pocomoke High School Principal Annette Wallace led the integration of restorative measures into the school between 2012 and 2018. \nAll schools in the county have since implemented restorative practices, with many ramping up their effort in the past two years. The recent ramp-up included dozens of professional development days in the summer of 2023 for faculty and staff, who then introduced “community-building circles” where students and teachers can discuss issues within each school. \nThe transition shifted the focus on discipline to a more situational approach, where troubled students are encouraged to talk their way through problems and repair what was harmed, whether it is another student’s feelings or a physical object.\nThe new approach appears to have created a calmer atmosphere in the county’s schools. During the 2022-23 school year, 432 violent incidents were reported in the district — while in 2023-24, there were only 285, according to Wallace, who now serves as chief safety and academic officer for grades 9-12 at Worcester County Public Schools. \nThere hasn’t been a single fight reported in the fall semester at Pocomoke High School, according to Rayne.  \nPocomoke High School was not the same place a decade ago. Wallace said the hallways were full of conflicts, and a student even punched a teacher in the face in 2010.\nRasheeda Collier, who graduated in 2009 and is now a restorative practices administrator at Pocomoke, laughed when asked how the school environment could have changed if these practices had been implemented when she attended the school. Collier recalled a different method of conflict resolution.\nSuspension rates were high, and students weren’t given the chance to explain their actions or discuss their deeper-rooted issues leading to misbehavior. \n“It was a different time,” Collier said. “They felt like suspension was more effective in punishment — versus now, we’re looking at research and we’re looking at data and we’re looking at the outcomes. Suspension is not effective for children. Restoring, rebuilding, repairing, promoting empathy, compassion — that’s a more effective purpose than suspension.”\nConflict and consequences\nCollier now runs the LIFT — Learning Interventions for Transformation — classroom, where students who misbehave are referred. There, they discuss what they did wrong and how to move past it.\nSuspensions are now rare at Pocomoke High School. Instead, students work with Collier in the LIFT classroom to discuss why they acted a certain way. \nStudents also set goals to help them break their pattern of negative behavior, Rayne said. These strategies can include self-regulation or self-control. Students check in with Collier for a period of time depending on the severity of their actions, and keeping those students in class is a priority. \n“We’re not doing hardcore punishment,” Collier said. “We’re doing a rebuilding process with them, which is important because [students] feel safe.”\nRasheeda Collier, Pocomoke High School’s restorative practices administrator, poses for a portrait while holding a note a student had written to her. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nCollier said these practices appear to prevent students from making the same mistakes twice. Pocomoke had 50% fewer students with multiple referrals for bad behavior from September through December than it did in the same period a year earlier, Rayne said. \n“Our students are still able to learn, and they’re actually able to grow in the area of social-emotional strategies,” Rayne said. \nThe school also offers conflict resolution circles — or restorative conferences — for students when they are involved in verbal or physical altercations between other students or teachers. These conflict resolution circles are led by a trained mediator and allow both parties to reflect on their roles in the problem and how they can move on from it.\nSnow Hill High School junior Dai’Jon Johnson participated in a restorative conference after an altercation with a teacher. During the conversation, the pair realized their argument was a misunderstanding. They talked their way through their issues.\n“I got what I had to say off my chest and the teacher did, too, and we all hugged at the end,” Johnson said. “It was cool. … I feel like it really helps you see the other side of people.”\nMore from Youth mental health: What works?\nBuilding community\nRestorative practices involve much more than a reimagined approach to school discipline. They also get students and teachers talking in hopes of preventing disciplinary problems.\nClassrooms use “community-building circles” at least once a week to help students and teachers find common ground with differing emotions and experiences. \n​​“Through positive relationship building, you build stronger character in your students,” Wallace said. \nThe circles offer students and teachers an opportunity to share their thoughts on the question of the day and interact through active listening. \n“At first, I wasn’t too keen on it,” said Stevens, the Pokomoke senior. “I actually really do think it does help [keep] the classroom together, especially with our small classroom sizes in Pocomoke.”\nShe said students learn more about their peers’ personalities through discussion questions such as: “What superpower would you want to have?” or “What are you doing for winter break?” These simple questions open space for students to connect. \n“I like knowing more about the people around me,” Stevens said.\nKanye Reid, a junior at Pocomoke, said the circles offer a safe place for those who often don’t speak up in class. \nKanye Reid, a Pocomoke High School junior, speaks about his involvement in the school community, including the process of delivering morning announcements. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\n“For more personal questions as well, if you want to share, it offers a space … so you’re not just stuck suffering in silence,” Reid said. \nTeachers also benefit from community-building circles and discuss personal stories and facts they otherwise wouldn’t have the chance to share. The circles humanize teachers and help students see their instructors as individuals who have their own set of passions and hardships, according to Snow Hill High School government teacher David “D.J.” Draus. \n“It pays off down the road when you go back to being a teacher and you’re asking [students] to do some challenging things … they don’t want to do as learners,” Draus said. “You have to basically ask them to trust you … and you can’t just build trust in students by being a teacher of content.” \nCriticism and implementation\nThe use of restorative practices is growing in the nation’s schools — but not without some criticism.\nThe National Center for Education Statistics reported 59% of schools in their subject pool utilized restorative practices in 2022, up from 42% four years earlier. Parents Defending Education, a nonprofit designed to “keep politics out of education,” reported 1,474 school districts nationwide participate in the practices. \nParents Defending Education claims restorative practices can lead to a lack of accountability for students involved in violent or disruptive behavior. The organization also raised concerns the practices could prioritize “feelings” over actual consequences, which could halt learning. \nThe Delmarva Parent Teacher Coalition, a Salisbury, Maryland, parent-teacher group, agrees restorative practices help create excuses for a child’s bad behavior. \n“Restorative Practices does reduce the number of suspensions, expulsions, arrests and juvenile referrals not because it’s effective, but because it’s designed to downplay, minimize and prevent reporting in the name of ‘social justice,’” editors wrote in a 2024 article called, “Why School ‘Restorative Practices’ are Destructive.”\nMembers of the Delmarva Parent Teacher Coalition declined an interview request.\nHowever, supporters of restorative practices said these criticisms may not be enough to discredit the work done at Pocomoke High School and other Worcester County schools. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPocomoke High School faculty members monitor and move throughout a hallway during a class period.

Right: The exterior of Pokomoke High School. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\n \nWallace said for restorative practices to work, all students and staff must be on board. \n“It’s worth the time,” Wallace said.\nInvesting in students to provide conflict resolution strategies and promote community will help kids focus on staying in the classroom, she said. When conflict rates drop, students spend more time learning.  \n“Those are hours and hours of time our school administrators and our teachers got back with kids, and hours of time our kids got back in instruction,” Wallace said.\nThe talk-heavy approach intrinsic to restorative practices comes naturally to some, Rayne said. She said through ample training sessions and community investments, any educator can come to adopt — and appreciate — restorative practices. \n“That’s what happy humans do,” Rayne said. “We’re restorative.”",

    "content": "Baltimore city principal Yetunde Reeves makes it a priority to encourage strong attendance at her school. Reeves, principal of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, said improving attendance is the first step in educating her students.\n“We have just made it like a big deal here and it’s something that we have a campaign around,” Reeves said. “Every time I interact with a student, I always look at their attendance.”\nStudent absenteeism rates have proliferated across the state and the country since the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of Maryland students are absent from school each year.\nHere’s what we know.\n\nWhat causes chronic absenteeism?\nChronic absenteeism, when students miss 10% or more of school, has surged across the nation after the COVID-19 pandemic. This means many students are missing out on at least 18 days of school each academic year.\nIn Maryland, nearly 27% of students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year, an increase of over 7% from 2018, according to Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) data. Chronic absenteeism in Maryland reached almost 40% in 2022.\nAbsenteeism can be caused by a variety of factors, according to Jing Liu, an assistant education professor at the University of Maryland.\nSchool climate can contribute to absences, especially if students don’t feel safe or a sense of belonging to the school, Liu explained. Some students may move homes frequently or have the responsibility to take care of their siblings. Others may deal with personal health issues.\n“There’s no single reason for student absenteeism,” Liu said. “It’s really complex in terms of the interplay between the individual student, their family, their school environment and even their community.”\nHaving 10 absences across all subjects in 9th grade reduces both the probability of a student graduating and enrolling in college by 2%, according to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Economics. Liu, who contributed to the study, said missing school can lead to lower test scores and grades.\nWhich Maryland counties are facing the highest rates of chronic absenteeism?\nBaltimore City had the highest chronic absenteeism rate of all 24 Maryland jurisdictions, with nearly half of all public school students chronically absent last school year.\nReeves said transportation can be a barrier to Baltimore city students, especially when some travel more than an hour and a half to attend school.\n \n\nTwo Baltimore City schools had chronic absenteeism rates higher than 90% last school year. Some schools with a high chronic absenteeism are alternative high schools or serve students with special needs.\nRates were also especially high for high school students. Last school year, 35% of Maryland high school students were chronically absent from school, compared to about 23% of elementary school students.\n \n﻿\nAbsenteeism rates are higher among Hispanic and Black students. Last school year, over 45% of Hispanic students and over 40% of Black students were chronically absent from school, according to state data. Over 24% of white students and almost 17% of Asian students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year.\nHow can chronic absenteeism be addressed at schools?\nPrincipal Eugenia Young spends many nights worrying about the students absent from class at her Baltimore City high school.\nYoung is the principal of Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School, an alternative high school that serves adult students who are often many credits away from graduation. Excel Academy had an attendance rate of 44% last school year, according to Baltimore City Public Schools.\n“Our kids don’t get educated, they will struggle,” Young said. “That means the country will struggle, that means the city of Baltimore will struggle.”\nDespite Excel Academy’s high rate of chronic absenteeism, the high school won an award from Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott after increasing its daily attendance by 16% between 2023 and 2024.\nEffective strategies to combat absenteeism included putting students on attendance contracts and scheduling parent conferences, Young said. The school also provided incentives like gift cards or snow tubing trips.\n“Kids really want to do those experiences, because they know in a normal setting, that’s not something that their parents may be able to afford for them to do,” Young said. “They’re still kids at the end of the day.”\nSebastian Harris, a senior at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore City, said he has barely missed school throughout his academic career. Some students will still skip school because they get bored or can drive somewhere else, he explained.\n“It’s a problem because it’s affecting more than just what you’re learning today,” Harris said. “It affects tomorrow and the day after and the day after.”\nBut Harris doesn’t just have strong attendance because of the incentives his school offers. Sometimes, it’s the teachers who make a difference. Many students attend Harris’ Spanish class, for example, because his teacher keeps students engaged.\nMonique Keene-King, a pupil personnel worker in Montgomery County Public Schools, said relationship-building can improve student attendance. This can range from dropping by a family’s house or simply complimenting a student in the hallway, she said.\nUltimately, school staff must let students know that they will not give up on them, Keene-King said.\n“We care about kids,” she said. “We want our young people to be productive and successful community members.”\nHow is chronic absenteeism being addressed at a state-wide level?\nBeyond citywide approaches, state education leaders are taking initiative to address chronic absenteeism across Maryland schools. The Maryland State Department of Education stated it is committed to reducing the chronic absenteeism rate to 15% by next school year.\nA Maryland General Assembly bill introduced in January aims to create a chronic absenteeism task force that will make recommendations to the governor by the end of 2025. Another bill introduced in the same month mandates each county board of education to identify the root cause of chronic absenteeism.\nDelegate Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s County), the second bill’s primary sponsor, said finding the root cause of chronic absenteeism at the local level will be a smart use of taxpayer dollars.\n“This will help inform the task force so that they can develop the recommendations that they need,” she said.\nMary Gable, assistant state superintendent at MSDE, said the education department’s current attendance task force is developing a toolkit to address student absenteeism.\nUltimately, school needs to be a place where students feel safe to learn and improve, Gable said. It should be a place, she said, where someone can look at a student and say, “We’re glad you’re here today.”",

    "content": "EDITOR’S NOTE: Because of incorrect information provided to the Local News Network by a source, an earlier version of this story misattributed the fact sheet noted at the end of this story, which advocates for restoring youth mental health funding in Maryland. The Mental Health Association of Maryland published and circulated that fact sheet. The story has been updated accordingly.\nCatholic Charities of Baltimore won state grants to fight chronic absenteeism in three Maryland public school districts by connecting troubled students with the mental health services they need. \nThrive Behavioral Health won state funding to work with students with severe behavioral issues in five school districts to keep the youths from being removed from school — and the agency said its tactics are working.\nOverall, the new statewide youth mental health program that funded those two efforts supported behavioral health services for more than 58,000 students in its first eight months of operations from March through  October 2024.  Four out of every five of Maryland public schools received aid for mental health services under the state’s effort. \nBut as the General Assembly moved to balance Maryland’s fiscal 2025 budget last spring, lawmakers cut funding for the state’s fledgling youth mental health program from Gov. Wes Moore’s recommended $110 million to $40 million. And with the state’s fiscal problems deepening, Moore is recommending the state allocate $40 million annually through 2030 to a program he once suggested should get $130 million a year starting in fiscal 2026.\nMeagan Pantelis, a clinical social worker at Thrive Behavioral Health, said the proposed cuts would decimate services for students that, in many cases, are just getting off the ground.\n“Whenever I found out about that proposed cut, the very first thing that came to mind is that Gov. Moore is wanting to balance a budget on the backs of our children,” Pantelis said. “I just find that to be just egregious. I mean, why are our children the population that we are targeting? Why are they not the population that we want to build up and support?”\nMoore, however, has stressed the state must act to close a structural $3 billion budget gap driven in part by the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan that created the youth mental health program. \n“We only have difficult decisions ahead,” Moore said in his State of the State address in early February. “We must close this $3 billion budget gap.”\nThe mental health crisis\nAmong its many reform efforts, the Blueprint established a new agency — the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports — to manage the new statewide youth mental health effort. The General Assembly then provided the agency with $119.7 million over two years to set up its operations and then issue its first $111 million  in grants in February 2024.\nThere’s a reason why the General Assembly initially invested so much in youth mental health. During the 2022-23 school year, over a quarter of Maryland high school students reported their mental health was not good at most or all times, according to a Maryland Department of Health survey. \nMore from Youth mental health: What works?\nThe percentage was only slightly lower for middle school students, with 22% reporting their mental health was not good at most or all times. Even more students in both middle and high school reported feeling sad or hopeless for at least two weeks in the past year. \n“We all know generally that there’s a mental health crisis,” said Lorianne Moss, the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission program manager. “So as sort of the preamble to our first call for proposals, we laid out some data.”\nThat data, from the Centers for Disease Control, showed 40% of high school students experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Citing such statistics, the consortium urged mental health programs and nonprofits across the state to apply for funds. \nApplicants requested a total of $380 million in grants, said Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, which oversees the consortium. That’s more than three times more than the consortium had to allocate.\nNevertheless, the state funded mental health service providers in every county. The program also allows service providers to offset treatment costs if families do not have access to insurance, or if students have high copays. \nWhile Luckner and Moss praised the achievements from the first round of grants, they declined to comment on its uncertain future. \nPreventing suicide\nPreventing youth suicide is one of the consortium’s key goals, said Dr. John Campo, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Sixteen of the consortium’s 129 grants so far focus on suicide prevention.\nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and third for people ages 15-24, according to the most recent CDC data.\n “Suicide kills more young people in that age group than cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, infections of all kinds, meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, COVID — the whole nine yards,” Campo said. “Add them all together, suicide kills more people than all those things combined.” \nCampo, who is also vice president of psychiatric services at Kennedy Krieger Institute, a Baltimore facility that specializes in treating people with neurological, developmental and psychological issues, was invited to join the consortium because of his expertise in the field. \nSuicide rates among youth and young adults increased 62% nationwide from 2007 to 2021, according to the CDC. Meanwhile in Maryland, the teen suicide rate increased by more than a third from 2014 through 2022.\nCampo said the state’s health care system has been ill-equipped to deal with that increase.\n“Mental health crisis isn’t a priority in most emergency departments,” Campo said.\nCampo is one of the co-chairs of the consortium’s best practices subcommittee, a group that developed a list of evidence-based mental health practices for grantees to implement. \nEach program targets a different facet of the mental health crisis. The responses are also tailored to the varying levels of severity of the mental health conditions different age groups experience. \nThe consortium found through surveys targeted at both students and parents that 90% of students and families were satisfied with the services.\n“A lot of these practices have been tested,” Campo said. “If regional organizations adopt them and implement them with fidelity, we really do want to believe that there will be positive outcomes associated with it.”\nFrom the city to the shore\nThe youth mental health crisis touches all of Maryland, and so does the state’s response — but grants are tailored to the vast differences among Maryland’s urban, suburban and rural communities.\nIn Baltimore City, the 11 grants the consortium issued take into account a stigma surrounding mental health services, said Jennifer Cox, director of the University of Maryland School Mental Health Program, which received a $970,000 grant to run a number of programs.\n“We think in Baltimore City, we have to be a little bit more creative than just saying, ‘Come get help,’ ” Cox said. “We know we have good things to offer, we just need to find a good way to offer it.”\nIn working with trusted community organizations such as churches and youth centers, the program has been able to reach people who would otherwise not seek out mental health treatment, Cox said. \nServices range from in-school counseling from certified clinicians to parent and caregiver education programs. \n“We have to invest in it in a significant way now and going forward for the next 30 years because so many of our young people are suffering,” said Britt Patterson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “As a result, the adults in their lives are also struggling.”\nThe consortium funded a similar but much larger array of programs in Prince George’s County, which received $24.9 million — the most of any county. The funding will set up a mobile response team to respond to young people experiencing mental health crises while increasing online and in-person counseling and other services. \nOne of the county’s largest grants, totaling $2.7 million, went to EveryMind, a nonprofit that is vastly expanding its mentoring and therapy offerings as part of what it calls “Project Wellness.” Projects include training sessions for parents and school staff to teach them more about mental health, including how to manage crises.\n“This initiative will create a supportive environment where students and families can truly flourish, meeting their mental health needs with compassion, cultural sensitivity and care,” said Patrice Harrell-Carter, director of Project Wellness.\nMeanwhile, the state’s efforts on the largely rural Eastern Shore stress increasing access to treatment in a region that’s short of professionals to respond to the youth mental health crisis. According to the October 2024 report, “Investing in Maryland’s Behavioral Health Talent,” Maryland is nearly 50% short of the mental health workers it needs. \n“There’s a resounding message of, we just need more,” said Beth Anne Dorman, CEO of For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center that received a grant to expand its services in Kent County, the state’s least populous. “We need more.”\nCaroline County, where two organizations won grants to expand their mental health services, faces the same situation, said Derek Simmons, the county’s superintendent of schools. \n“We are a rural county that is less wealthy than a lot of parts of the state,” said Simmons, co-chair of the consortium’s best practices committee. “So access to behavioral health is near and dear, and a real challenge where I’m at.”\nAn uncertain future\nYet the state budget crunch looms as a threat to its youth mental health efforts.\nIf the General Assembly agrees with the funding levels suggested in the governor’s budget, programs that just started last year may have to be eliminated, said Del. Eric Ebersole, a Democrat who represents parts of Baltimore and Howard counties.\n“That group worked in good faith to bring providers online,” said Ebersole, a consortium member. “If the government loses them, can you get them back?”\nDan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said the proposed cut in planned funding comes at a time when youth mental health care is more important than ever.\n“At a time when 18% of high school students and 24% of middle school students have seriously considered suicide in the past year, a reduction of this size in school mental health funding could prove disastrous,” Martin said.\nIf the General Assembly approves Moore’s budget proposal, the grants distributed by the program in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 combined will be cut 28% from the total amount distributed the prior two years.\nAsked for comment, Moore’s office stressed the governor’s proposed allocation for fiscal year 2026 and beyond is exactly what the General Assembly approved for 2025.\n“Gov. Moore is maintaining the current level of funding for the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports,” wrote a spokesperson from the governor’s office. “The Governor strongly supports behavioral health treatment for Maryland’s children, and maintaining current levels of funding during the state’s budget crisis reflects that commitment.”\nBut the Moore spokesperson’s statement ignored that only a year ago, a Moore budget proposal called for significantly expanding funding for the consortium to $130 million annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2029. Instead, the current proposal allocates $40 million per year through fiscal year 2030.\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland is urging action to try to persuade the General Assembly to restore funding to a higher level. The organization is circulating a fact sheet with information on the consortium, the work it’s done and what a permanent cut in funding would do to students and schools. \n“Use the above information and write an email to your legislators asking them to restore funding to the Community Supports Partnership Fund,” the fact sheet said. “Provide testimony (either written or oral or both) opposing the cut” at General Assembly hearings. \nAnd under the “why is funding needed” section, the Mental Health Association fact sheet reads: “Dramatic worsening of the behavioral health of children and youth over the last decade.”",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS – Gov. Wes Moore’s proposal to freeze and cut funding to some programs under Maryland’s 10-year education reform plan is running into major objections from advocates.\nThese cuts could alter the existing law under the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, but controversial measures like freezing funding for schools in high-poverty areas have left the fate of both the bill and the state’s budget unknown.\n“This is a cut to everyone, but it’s a specific cut to students living in poverty, black and brown students, multilingual students,” said Riya Gupta, interim executive director of Strong Schools Maryland. “But it’s going to hurt every single student and teacher in Maryland.”\nOverall the bill would slow the implementation of the Blueprint, an ambitious expenditure plan targeting schools set into motion in 2021 by the legislature without a solid payment method. The move targets the budget crisis by generally reducing state spending on public education. Moore’s bill would decrease state spending in public education by $52.6 million for fiscal year 2026, with $727 million in decreases by 2030, according to the fiscal and policy note on the measure.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA post shared by Maryland Capital News Service (@cnsmd)\n\n\n\nMajor actions in the proposal include freezing funding increases that community schools, or schools that qualify for a concentration of poverty grant, had expected to see. It also pauses the implementation of an initiative giving teachers more collaborative planning time during the workday.\nNearly every seat in Annapolis’ joint-hearing room was filled at a hearing this week, flooded with students in blue shirts wearing their support for the Blueprint. High school students, parents, education advocates and eight Maryland school superintendents testified in opposition to some or all actions in the bill.\nGupta is concerned about the funding freezes for concentration of poverty grants. These grants are based on a formula calculating the amount of funding required per student. While community schools were set to see a significant increase in funding per student in the initial law, this bill proposes keeping funding at the same level it is currently.\n“We know anytime we disinvest in schools, bad things happen, and that’s just a fact,” Gupta said.\nLike Gupta, some lawmakers are worried about Moore’s proposal, specifically the cuts to community school funding.\n“It seems that this is the time that we should be wrapping our arms around our children who are in poverty, who are disproportionately kids of color, and we should be lifting those kids up,” Committee Chair Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a Democrat representing Howard County, said to a panel supporting the bill, including Moore’s chief of staff Fagan Harris.\n“I don’t like to say pause, it’s a cut,” Atterbeary continued, referring to the proposal to freeze funding to community schools. “When you cut the funding you are leaving a gap where some kids are quite frankly going to be caught out there and left behind.”\nAlong with the funding freeze, the bill would also delay the phase-in of collaborative time, a blueprint initiative requiring that teachers spend 60% of their time with students and the other 40% of their time planning. While this initiative would save the state money, Harris said the delay is due to a teacher shortage.\nTo combat that shortage, the bill proposes establishing a national teacher recruitment campaign. While some lawmakers argued that implementing collaborative time could help boost teacher retention numbers, Harris argued schools do not currently have the bandwidth to implement the program.\n“This proposal gives us the time to build the community of practice in our schools and across our districts that make our teaching profession stronger,” Harris said, in reference to pausing the collaborative time initiative. “It also avoids, frankly, stressing a system where we have a profound teacher shortage.”\nWhile many Democrats are worried about cutting funding for impoverished students, Republicans are worried about the overall spending.\n“The largest takeaway for everyone today should be that Governor Moore’s Administration and the Democratic leaders in Annapolis acknowledged what has been obvious to us for years – that taxes will have to be raised significantly to pay for the Blueprint,” House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, a Republican representing Allegany County, said Wednesday. “This certainly counters the ongoing fallacy that the Blueprint does not contribute to Maryland’s budget crisis.”",

    "content": "Maryland is set to examine their current method of evaluating poverty in schools throughout the next year, potentially opening up a pathway to boost funding for schools with students in need.\nA new study is meant to help address the undercounting of poverty in Maryland public schools according to Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman. The Board of Public Works approved funding for the study at its Dec. 4 meeting.\n“This issue is exacerbated for undocumented students or citizen children of undocumented parents,” Lierman said at that meeting. \nThe current method of tabulating poverty “really penalizes” schools with large numbers of immigrant students, Lierman said.\nThe state currently uses proxy measures, such as eligibility for national programs like Medicaid and SNAP, to calculate aid for public schools, according to the proposal for funds from the Department of General Services.  \nAccording to the Governor’s Office for Children an accurate count of students in poverty is important to ensure that they get adequate resources. The office also told CNS that the “Blueprint for Maryland’s Future created several new school funding streams that rely on counts of low-income students.”\nSchools currently rely on applications for the free and reduced meals program and enrollment in social programs like Medicaid as methods of calculating students in poverty. According to the Governor’s Office for Children, “not all low income families participate in these programs.” \nThe office also said that “districts that provide free school meals to all students under the federal community eligibility program do not collect that data.”\nIn the case of immigrant families, some may not qualify or, as the office told CNS, may be hesitant to enroll and reveal their citizenship status.\nOther data the state might rely upon is out of date. According to Lierman, the Maryland State Department of Education recently proposed using data from 2013 to calculate school poverty in Baltimore City. Lierman said that many public schools have been shuttered in the city since that data was collected.\n“As a Baltimore City Public School mom,” Lierman said, “I’ve got a lot of strong feelings about this.”\nThe board approved the DGS request for $48,000 monthly for “modeling, analysis and providing a presentation on findings.” \nAccording to the Office for Children, a recommendation based on the results of the study will be made to the Maryland General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2025.",

    "content": "In Carroll County, schools are required to notify parents if a student wishes to change their pronouns or otherwise identify as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, according to guidelines published by Carroll County Public Schools (CCPS).\nThis policy contradicts guidelines published by the Maryland State Department of Education, which does not require schools to share information on a student’s sexuality or gender with their parents or guardians.\nCapital News Service analyzed documents obtained from 21 school districts in the state through a Maryland Public Information Act request and found that Carroll County’s school policies on transgender and non-conforming gender students are uniquely stringent in requiring parental notification compared to other counties.\nThe Carroll County school system states parents should be involved in decisions regarding their child’s gender identity including the student’s choice to use their preferred name, pronouns and desired facilities like restrooms and locker rooms in school.\nThe CCPS student services manual states when a student informs the school of their wish to change their gender identity or pronouns, the school will arrange a conference that includes the student, school administrator, school counselor and the student’s parent or guardian.\nAccording to the manual, the conference is mandatory “regardless of the parent or guardian’s knowledge of the student’s status”.\nCCPS and the county school board declined Capital News Service’s request for an interview and declined to provide a comment regarding their policy.\nWendy Novak, a mother to a transgender child attending high school in Carroll County, believes parental notification policies may be harmful to students.\n“Students are the real stakeholders of the system, and by putting parents first, it ignores the fact that there are some abusive parents,” Novak said.\nNovak said the problem is not just that parents need to be notified if their child wants to go by a different pronoun but they would need to give consent.\nFlorence Ashley, assistant professor of law at the University of Alberta, echoes Novak’s sentiment, stating parental notification measures are put in place “for parents who are opposed to their kid being trans and who want to effectively try to discourage their kid from being trans.”\nAshley, who uses they/them pronouns, pushed back on the integrity of a parents ability to know things regarding their child, especially if it will presumably put their child in danger.\n“Knowing so that you can help the child grow in their best interests is one thing,” they said. “Having a right to know even if it’s detrimental to their best interests just because you have this sentiment of entitlement is another and that’s one that I don’t think we can accept.”\nMark Eckstein, co-chair of advocacy for Metro DC PFLAG, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, acknowledged the debate over parental involvement in school matters, particularly for students grappling with identity issues.\n“On the surface, yes, of course, everyone wants a parent to be involved and to be notified of how their kid is doing,” Eckstein said. “The issue arises when there aren’t supportive parents.”\nAccording to Eckstein, teachers should first empathize with the student and ensure they are supported at home before involving parents when the student wishes to change their name or gender identity.\nHe called for state-level action to establish baseline protections.\n“A state like Maryland should come in and provide as much local autonomy as possible, but on certain issues, especially those related to civil rights and discrimination and bias, [it] should provide a floor saying that this is the law,” Eckstein said. “These are the things that should be done to protect, in this case, trans students.”\nIn 2022, Maryland amended and implemented its education policy to include prohibiting discipline of or discrimination against students on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity.\nAlmost a decade ago, the Maryland State Department of Education published “Guidelines for Gender Identity Non-Discrimination” which states that schools are not required to notify parents and should make the decision on parental notification based on consultation with the student. The guidelines recognize that “notifying parents carries risks for the students” in some cases.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education pointed Capital News Service to the “Safe and Supportive Schools for All Students” guide the department released in October, which emphasized all students’ right to privacy.\nThe guide notes that sensitive information related to student gender identity “generally need not be disclosed without the student’s consent”, even though information in official student records must be shared upon parents request.\nThe education department highlighted in the guide that there is no state or federal law that “requires schools to affirmatively disclose this sensitive information to parents”.\nAlthough school districts are not required to follow the guidelines proposed by the state education department – districts set their own policies and guidelines– some school districts, like Montgomery County, aim to align their guidelines with the state.\nAccording to Christopher Cram, director at the Department of Communications in Montgomery County Public Schools, Montgomery County’s goal when creating their guidelines was to be inclusive and recognize that LGBTQ+ individuals “are absolutely a part of our community.”\nOther Maryland counties– including Anne Arundel, Caroline and Frederick– mention parental notification for students who wish to change their pronouns, but in the policies and guidelines reviewed by CNS, none besides Carroll explicitly require it.\nCaroline County, for example, recommends “Case-by-case decisions regarding parent notification should be made in consultation with the student and should reflect all factors that affect the student’s well-being” for high school students in “Transgender Student: Guidelines for Support” from 2021.\nKit Hart, the chapter chair for the Moms for Liberty Carroll County chapter, states parents have a fundamental right to be in charge of their child’s “upbringing, education, moral formation and medical decisions.”\n“That’s a fundamental right that was given to us by God (that) cannot be taken away,” Hart said.\nMoms for Liberty is a conservative parent’s rights group that started in January 2021 with chapters across the country.\nMany Moms for Liberty members are “rightly alarmed” that schools have been overstepping their authority with their kids, and taking parental authority and rights away, according to Suzie Scott, Harford County’s Moms for Liberty chapter chair.\n“I don’t think gender identity should be discussed in schools. It is, first of all, not a scientific concept, and it is something that, if it is discussed at all, should be discussed at home,” Hart said.\nAccording to the Moms for Liberty website, they hold their school board “accountable by maintaining relationships with each of the Board members”.\nSchool district policies are set by these school boards. The Local News Network (LNN) previously reported on the battle for transgender rights being waged in Maryland school districts. Candidates running for school board in 2024 who responded to a LNN survey were nearly split on the issue of parental notification for gender non-conforming students.\nJoanna Bache Tobin, who successfully won re-election to the Anne Arundel County school board last month, told LNN that “enabling students to determine for themselves how they wish to be addressed and referred to is critical to that safe and inclusive environment.”\nNovak and Shaun Maidens, a mother to a transgender high schooler in Carroll County, have attended school board meetings to bring awareness to the issues faced by their children at school.\nNovak and Maidens’ children endured harassment and bullying in high school since coming out.\nAshley emphasizes the importance of trans youth having affirming spaces. For some students, school is the only place they can be themselves, Ashley said.\nMaidens uses interactions she has with others that question her son’s identity as a learning moment to expose others to the complexities and normalities of LGBTQ+ youth.\n“It’s not really parents’ rights,” Novak said. “It’s parents’ rights to control my child too.”",

    "content": "Conservative school board candidates saw sweeping wins across Maryland this week, defying expectations in the largely blue state and solidifying the influence of the 1776 Project PAC, the Republican-aligned organization that endorsed 19 candidates statewide.\nIn total, 11 of the political action committee’s endorsed candidates either won or narrowly led their races as of Friday morning. Candidates backed by the PAC won control of the school boards in Somerset and Calvert counties, while appearing poised to win in Talbot County. Final results await the counting of some mail-in and provisional ballots, which must be counted by Nov. 15.\nCampaign finance records show that the Maryland State Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education — the political arm of the state’s teachers union — spent $516,999.57 during the 2024 election cycle. And the 1776 Project PAC clearly sees the teachers’ union as its defeated rival in the election.\n“Even outspending us by $450,000, the teachers’ union couldn’t beat us in deep-blue Maryland—their message is just too extreme,” said Stefano Forte, executive director of the 1776 Project PAC. “Voters chose raising test scores and graduation rates over their far-left culture war. On Tuesday, common sense won, and that has no price tag.”\nA fourth school district with candidates targeted for defeat by Democrats – Washington County – also flipped to conservative control without the aid of the 1776 Project PAC.\nOf those 11 winners endorsed by that conservative PAC, six had also been targeted for defeat by the Maryland Democratic Party, which selected 24 “extreme” conservative school board candidates in the state to directly invest against – a move the party referred to as “unprecedented.” Of those 24, only nine have been lost thus far. The remaining 15 all won or are leading their respective races.\n“We are proud that we pushed out some of the most extreme elements in these races,” said Luca Amayo, spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party. “It’s clear, however, that we must continue to bolster our grassroots efforts and make Marylanders aware of the far-right agenda encroaching into Maryland’s public schools, especially as they are emboldened under a Donald Trump presidency.” \nThe party considers the 1776 Project PAC a “radical ring-wing group,” and helped defeat five of its endorsed candidates from winning office. Ryan James Girdusky, the committee’s founder, wrote on the PAC’s website that he created the organization “to change public education by reforming school boards and electing reform-minded conservatives who wanted to improve public education in this country.”\nAs of Oct. 16, the PAC had pumped $90,580.50 toward the campaigns of 13 candidates across Cecil, Queen Anne’s, Talbot, Calvert, Somerset and St. Mary’s counties. Of those 13, seven have won their elections and one remains too close to call. \nIn Calvert County, candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC won all three school board seats. \nRetired principal Mike Shisler lost his bid for the board. He said he fears that the new conservative leadership, all of whom were targeted by the state’s Democratic Party as well, would create inequity and fear within the county’s education system.\n“I’m very disappointed in the results,” Shisler said Wednesday, “It’s not going to be inclusive of everybody. It’s going to target folks. It’s going to try to undo the work of previous boards of education when it came to stressing equity and diversity, and I think they’re trying to roll back the clock.” \nJoseph Marchio, who defeated Shisler, said he expected a close race going into Tuesday night. His margin was the closest of the three 1776 Project PAC-backed victors in Calvert County. \nIn Washington County, on the state’s panhandle, all four candidates that Democrats targeted for defeat won their election, flipping the county’s school board into conservative control. All three non-targeted incumbents lost reelection, while April Ann Zentmeyer, the only targeted incumbent, defended hers. \n“I look forward to working with new board members and faithful colleagues to maximize opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and parents; and to identify solutions that will strengthen WCPS,” Zentmeyer said in a statement.\nWashington County has a county-wide school board election process, as opposed to the school districts where candidates are elected by district. Instead of one-on-one races, all school board candidates in Washington County face each other in a crowded pool, with the top four vote-getting candidates winning seats. Carroll, Allegany and Frederick counties have similar systems. \nThe success of conservative school board candidates around Maryland reflects a larger trend from this year’s election cycle: the state’s rightward shift. According to data from the Associated Press, every county in Maryland shifted rightward this year compared to the 2020 election – from two points in Charles County and Baltimore City to eight points in Cecil County.\nSome races remain too close to call. In Frederick County, two conservative candidates targeted by Democrats led the race for three seats as of Friday, but two other candidates trailed close behind. Talbot County, which flipped conservative this cycle, saw two 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidates win seats, while a third trailed by a narrow margin as of Friday.\nSomerset County, the third district flipped by 1776 Project PAC-endorsed contenders, saw massive margins of victory for the conservatives, with Mary Beth Bozman securing about four-fifths of the vote in her race. Her opponent was Alverne “Chet” Chesterfield – who, the Local News Network reported last month, had a peace order initiated against him in 2022.\nThe Local News Network also reported that Brandie Edelen, a 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidate in St. Mary’s County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019. Edelen handily lost her race to Josh Guy.\nIn deep-blue Howard County, Andrea Chamblee is in a tight race with Trent Kittleman, an early supporter of the county’s Moms for Liberty chapter. Even though Democrat Kamala Harris carried over two-thirds of the votes cast in the presidential race in the county, Chamblee led  Kittleman by only 3.5 points as of Friday morning.\nMail-in and provisional ballots, which have leaned in favor of Chamblee this far, are still being counted.\nThe founder of Moms for Liberty in Frederick County, Jaime Brennan, appeared headed to victory. She said that despite the Maryland Democrats’ campaign against her and Colt Black, the other conservative in the race, that effort didn’t appear to be all that effective.\n“They spent a lot of money in opposition to me and Colt, and to prop up the other side, but I didn’t hear from a single person who said, ‘Oh, I heard about this and I’m not voting for you,’” Brennan said.\nIn neighboring Carroll County, where Moms For Liberty lobbied for the removal of 60 books from school libraries – 21 permanently – conservative candidates secured their hold on the board. Greg Malveaux and Kristen Zihmer defeated Amanda Jozkowski and Muri Lynn Dueppen, who together ran an underdog progressive campaign called the Slate for Student Success, which was endorsed by the Carroll County Educators Association. \n“It’s really a shame that a lot of voters in our county chose to kind of take their marching orders from their political party, rather than considering the opinions of the educators,” Jozkowski said. She previously ran and lost in 2022.\nJozkowski said the race was a reflection of the national results, which saw an overwhelming rightward shift in nearly every state and in many down-ballot races. Malveaux and Zihmer were both targeted by the Maryland Democrats. \nThat rightward shift could also be seen in the school board race in Anne Arundel County’s District 3. There, the conservative candidate, Chuck Yocum, fell only 2.76 points behind his opponent, Erica McFarland, despite weeks of controversy over Yocum’s 1994 acquittal on child sexual abuse and perverted practices charges.\nLocal News Network reporters Sasha Allen, Marwa Barakat, Ela Jalil, Colin McNamara and Tolu Talabi contributed to this report.\nCorrections: An earlier version of the story said 10 candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC had won their races. The correct number is 11. In addition, an earlier version identified Trent Kittleman as the founder of the Howard County chapter of Moms for Liberty. While she was an early supporter of the group, Lisa Geraghty is the group’s founder.",

    "content": "Anne Arundel County school board candidate Chuck Yocum made headlines when the Baltimore Banner reported earlier this month that he was accused and acquitted of child sexual abuse three decades ago.\nBut he’s not the only Maryland school board candidate to have faced legal issues of one sort or another. Alverne W. Chesterfield, a Somerset County candidate, had a peace order issued against him in 2022 which, he said, was tied to a dispute with a neighbor. And the state filed a tax lien against St. Mary’s County candidate Brandie Edelen back in 2019.\nThe Local News Network found those two issues in a review of the Maryland and federal court records of all 109 school board candidates in the state. LNN did not find court records of Yocum’s 1994 acquittal on a charge of child sex abuse, meaning the records were likely expunged after a jury found him not guilty.\nThe review found far fewer legal issues among school board candidates than LNN found two years ago. In the 2022 election, LNN found 12 candidates who had faced tax liens and a Charles County candidate who had been charged with shoplifting multiple times.\nThis year, the most serious alleged offense among Maryland school board candidates involved Yocum.\nYocum, who was a special education and social studies teacher at Anne Arundel County’s Northeast High School, was indicted on charges of child sexual abuse and perverted practices, The Washington Post reported more than 30 years ago.\nTerrie Jahnigen Warfield, who says she testified against Yocum, said in a social media post last week that she had sexual relations with Yocum when she was 16 years old.\n“I was emotionally, physically, mentally abused [by Yocum],” Warfied said. “I deserve justice, and so does everyone else that he’s hurt.”\nContacted by LNN and asked for a response to the allegations, Yocum referenced a statement from Warfield’s mother, Kathy Burkhard. LNN could not independently verify the statement, but on Monday, the Baltimore Sun quoted Burkhard as saying of her daughter: “She is incapable of telling the truth. I’ve had problems with her since she was almost 15.”\nAlthough Yocum was found not guilty of criminal charges, school officials launched a thorough internal investigation, according to The Banner, to determine the validity of allegations that Yocum sexually harassed or made inappropriate comments to students as young as 13.\n“Mr. Yocum was found not guilty of sexual abuse in a criminal court. This investigation, however, reviewed additional allegations against Mr. Yocum which were not criminal behaviors but possibly indicative of misconduct or immorality,” stated the school’s internal investigative report from 1994, which was reviewed by The Banner.\nYocum never returned to teaching after the Anne Arundel County Public Schools investigation, The Banner reported.\nSix Anne Arundel Democrats, including County Executive Steuart Pittman, have called for Yocum to drop out of the school board race, citing the allegations of child sexual abuse against him, The Banner reported.\nThe other legal issues that the Local News Network uncovered in its review of the school board candidates are far less serious than those surrounding Yocum.\nLNN found that Alverne W. “Chet” Chesterfield, who is running for the Board of Education in Somerset County’s District 2, had a peace order issued against him on May 31, 2022, which was valid through Dec. 6 of that year.  \nThe order states: “Shall Not Abuse, Shall Not Contact, Shall Not Enter Residence,” but the court order does not detail the circumstances that led to the peace order or name the person who requested it.\nWhen asked for comment about the peace order, Chesterfield told LNN: “It is not nothing to really comment on. It was just a dispute between myself and my neighbor regarding property line. That’s all.”\nHe said the disagreement was taken to court, and the matter was solved.\n“It is nothing serious,” he said.\nLNN also found that Brandie Edelen, who is running for an at-large school board seat in St. Mary’s County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019 because of $594.04 in back taxes.\nEdelen said that at the time, she and her family were dealing with funeral expenses and the disposition of the estate of her late father, who passed away in March 2019. She said she got distracted and “simply forgot to file the tax returns.” Filed in May of 2019, the lien was resolved and the tax paid in 2020. \nThe LNN review of candidate court records also found liens and other tax cases that may have been connected with other candidates, but could not be conclusively tied to those candidates based on court and State Board of Elections records. This happened in several cases where candidates have common first and last names.\nLNN only reported on candidates where birthdates and addresses conclusively proved they were the person involved in those court cases.",

    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network's 2024 School Board Voter Guide. \nA 10-year, $30 billion plan out of Annapolis, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future aims to dramatically improve the state’s public schools by boosting teacher salaries, expanding pre-kindergarten and rewriting the curriculum — and school board candidates say the state’s schools need that improvement.\n“The Blueprint is Maryland’s surest path to creating beyond great schools,” said Phelton Moss, a school board candidate from Prince George’s County.\nBut to hear other Maryland school board candidates tell it, the Blueprint is a budget-buster.\n“The Blueprint sounds great on paper; however, funding it is a great challenge for every county in Maryland,” St. Mary’s County school board candidate Elena Brewer said.\nThat debate echoes across Maryland as voters in 20 of the state’s 24 school districts prepare to go to the polls. With early voting set to begin on Thursday, Oct. 24, the Local News Network at the University of Maryland sent a questionnaire to all 109 candidates, asking them, among other things, to name the state’s top education issue.  \nAcademics came out on top. Twenty-seven of the 74 candidates who responded cited issues such as poor test scores and pandemic-related learning loss as the top issue. And 55 candidates offered at least some measure of praise for the Blueprint as a way to make Maryland’s schools better.\n\nBut at the same time, 42 of the candidates who responded to the questionnaire expressed concerns about the costs and the mandates stemming from the Blueprint. In a school board election where there are no races in Baltimore City or County, a Prince George’s County candidate, Zakyia Goins-McCants, summed up the views of a number of candidates from suburban and rural districts.\n“The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is transformative legislation that reflects our state's commitment to equitable education,” she said. “However, it was passed without a full funding plan, and the financial implications are significant.”\n'A transformational investment'\nPassed by the General Assembly in 2021 over the veto of then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, the Blueprint is built on five pillars. Under the Blueprint, school districts are mandated to:\n\nCombat the teacher shortage by increasing the minimum teacher salary to $60,000 by July 2026 and build new “career ladders” for educators.\nExpand pre-kindergarten so that it’s available free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all.\nAdjust the curriculum to ensure students are college- and career-ready by the end of 10th grade.\nImplement a “ninth-grade tracker” system to assess how the Blueprint is working for each student as part of a statewide accountability plan.\nBoost funding to match the state’s lofty new goals.\n\nHearing all of that, many of the state’s school board candidates said the Blueprint is a great but complex and pricey plan.\nTierney Davis, a board candidate from Cecil County, called the Blueprint “a transformational idea” but noted there are serious issues in implementing the plan. Veronica Lowe from Frederick County called it “a transformative investment in our education system” but expressed concerns about funding the effort.\nMichael Shisler from Calvert County said the plan is a chance to “improve our common good.”\n“If we continue to see education as a cost, rather than as an investment, then folks will just wait for this latest reform to fade away,” Shisler said. “The Blueprint is an opportunity to level the playing field for all kids in Maryland.”\nSeveral candidates said that the playing field needs leveling. \n“The most important issue facing Anne Arundel County Public Schools is the existence of persistent gaps in opportunity and achievement between different subgroups of students,” said Joanna Bache Tobin of Anne Arundel County.\nMeanwhile, Julie Kaplan of Howard County said schools must improve to make sure every student leaves school prepared for college or a career.\n“We must address the learning gaps created by the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said.\nA number of candidates cited stagnant or declining test scores in their school districts and beyond.\n“Statewide, our student proficiency rates in math and English are suffering,” said Laura McKenzie of Kent County.\nBut schools will improve if the Blueprint is implemented properly, its supporters said.\n“The Blueprint offers us an opportunity to invest in our schools and ensure an excellent education for every student,\" said Meg Ricks, a candidate for the school board in Howard County.\n‘Unfunded’\nSupport for the Blueprint was by no means uniform among the state’s school board candidates, however. Many echoed the thoughts of Andre Gao, another Howard County school board candidate.\n“The Blueprint for Maryland's Future sounds promising on paper with its goals, but the funding presents a significant problem,” Gao said. “Without adequate financial support, implementing the Blueprint will be challenging.”\nThe Blueprint lacks financial support at both the state and the district level. \nThe General Assembly approved the Blueprint without determining how it would be paid for, and as a result, the state is projected to run long-term deficits that largely track its increased education costs. A state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January said that the deficit will appear in fiscal 2025 and hit nearly $2.93 billion in fiscal 2029 – a year when the Blueprint is set to cost the state $4 billion.\nRachel Hise, the executive director of the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, said she is hopeful the Maryland General Assembly will fully fund the Blueprint and is willing to make changes if necessary.\nWhen asked whether state taxes will be raised to support the Blueprint, Hise said, “That is a decision for the governor and General Assembly.” \nAgainst that backdrop, Gov. Wes Moore – a longtime proponent of the Blueprint – has acknowledged that the plan may have to be altered.\n“While I believe in making sure that we have a world class education system, we've got to be able to work together to create an actual plan to be able to implement it because right now there are real challenges in being able to get that done and get it done in a way that the locals, and the state and every other partner who's involved sees that taking place,” Moore told Fox45 News in Baltimore in July. “So, there have to be adjustments.”\nMeanwhile, school district candidates said the Blueprint is already putting pressure on local school budgets, given that school costs in Maryland are shared by the state and its 24 districts.\n“While the Blueprint was touted as significantly increasing education funding, the reality is that the funding is not distributed equitably, and rural counties have been left out, by and large,” said Cathy Allen, a school board candidate in St. Mary’s County. “We did not receive increased funding from the state to cover mandates within the Blueprint.”\nSome candidates from larger Maryland counties expressed similar concerns.\n“The Blueprint is unfunded and full of mandates that will strain local school systems and their taxpayers,” said Joseph Marchio of Calvert County, who noted that Hogan vetoed the plan. “The Blueprint, while well intended, is focused around the belief that if you just throw enough money at a problem, it will go away or improve.”\n'So many requirements'\nSchool board candidates said they worry not only about the Blueprint’s costs, but also about the expensive edicts the plan imposes on local school districts. In some cases, they said, those mandates are already leading to unintended consequences.\nJon M. Andes, a candidate in Worcester County on the Eastern Shore, said he fully supports the Blueprint’s five pillars.\n“However, without additional state funding, we will not be able to implement the Blueprint plan without making significant budget cuts to reallocate funds,” Andes said. “As an example, to reach the $60,000 minimum (teacher) salary, we will need to significantly increase class size and reduce materials of instruction.” \nSuch things are already happening in Howard County, Gao said.\n“In our school district, we have not received sufficient funding from the state and county to fully implement the Blueprint,” he said. “This has contributed to budget shortfalls, leading to staff cuts, program reductions and increased class sizes. Many teachers have already expressed concerns about the negative impact of staff shortages and increased class sizes.”\nSuch issues stem from the fact that the Blueprint mandates that funding be redirected in a number of ways. For one thing, by mandating higher teacher salaries and a host of other changes, some school districts may be forced to cut other popular programs.\n“The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs it feels are successful,” said Kerry Gunshenan, a school board candidate in Talbot County.\nIn addition, the Blueprint mandates that districts direct more funding to schools with larger numbers of high-need students, such as those that are performing poorly or where students are learning to speak English.\nMike Lukas, a board member who is running for re-election in Charles County, praised that change.\n“Your ZIP code or household income should not define the quality of your education,” he said.\nBut Jaime Brennan, a school board candidate in Frederick County, said shifting money toward low-performing schools won’t necessarily make them better.\n“There is nothing in the Blueprint that will actually improve student performance, and it is designed to take money from districts and schools that are doing well and transfer it to schools that are not, when the issues at those schools cannot be solved by just spending more money on them,” Brennan said.\nMeanwhile, Tom Woods, who is running for re-election to the board in Garrett County, neatly summed up the thoughts of many of the school board members across the state.\n“The ideas and solutions presented by the Blueprint come with an awful lot of obstacles,” Woods said.\nLocal News Network director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network’s 2024 School Board Voter Guide. \nIn Montgomery County, school board candidate Brenda M. Diaz worries that  “knife-wielding vandals” have easy access to schools because the district removed the police officers that are on hand in the rest of Maryland’s public school districts to try to keep the peace.\nAcross the state on the Eastern Shore, school board candidate Karla Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County told the Local News Network in a candidate survey that teachers feel threatened by some of their students.\nAnd in Howard County, school board candidate Andrea Chamblee – whose husband, John McNamara, was shot to death in the 2018 mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis – said the threat of a school shooting is just one of the stressors looming over the county’s children.\n“Bullying, mental health struggles, technology addiction, unreliable transportation, larger class sizes, fewer fine art enrichment opportunities, portable classrooms, overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings, food insecurity, poor indoor air quality and bigotry are all eroding the well-being of our students and staff,” Chamblee said. “Students who aren’t well, can’t learn well.  In order to focus on academics, we must take on these safety challenges and provide students and staff with a stable learning environment.”\n\nConcern about school safety in Maryland spans the state – which is why candidates in Maryland’s school district races are stressing the issue. Of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network questionnaire, 48 said they were not entirely satisfied with school safety in their district. Many called for adding more law enforcement officers as well as mental health counselors to their local schools.\nDiaz advocates returning school resource officers to Montgomery County schools – but statistics, and the comments of school board candidates statewide, make clear that school safety and student behavior aren’t easily controlled just by in-school cops.\nSchool safety at a glance\nThe school safety problem is a national one. Violent incidents increased 49% in the nation’s schools the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Educator’s School Safety Network.\nMaryland has not yet released its 2023-2024 statistics, but in the 2022-2023 school year, the number of anonymously reported bullying or cyberbullying incidents rose over the prior year from 91 to 107 , according to the Maryland Center for School Safety. The number of assaults and threats to cause harm increased from 83 to 98. And the number of general school safety complaints shot up from 62 to 104.\nThe school safety center also tracks critical life threatening incidents, which are defined as incidents that cause death or serious injury, or acts of mass violence under law. These incidents for the past three school years totaled 17, 18 and 18.\nAmong those incidents are the following:\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2023, at a Baltimore City high school, a student worked in tandem with both of his parents to assault and shoot three other students.\nIn April 2024, Montgomery County Police arrested a high school senior who had written a 129-page manifesto on his plans for a school shooting.\nIn January 2024, a high school student was arrested after threatening mass violence and arson at the school, the Somerset County Sheriff’s Office said. The student had previously been caught with a gun at school, according to a county press release.\n\nSchool board candidate Matthew Warren Lankford, whose son was in the school at the time of that last incident, said that student is now back in school. “This student needs special attention and should never be allowed back in the school as a normal student again,” Lankford said.\nSchool resource officers \nSchool resource officers, the official name for trained officers in schools under Maryland’s 2019 Safe to Learn Act, are posted in some schools in every Maryland jurisdiction except Montgomery County. And many school board candidates expressed support for hiring more school resource officers. \n“I am satisfied with the safety for the big, catastrophic-type events,” said Jaime Brennan, a Frederick County school board candidate. “But I am not satisfied with the daily acts of violence…that occur. I think that expanding the school resource officer program so that we have a designated SRO in each middle and high school would help.”\nThe Maryland Center for School Safety is responsible for training school resource officers in the state and reports each year on their coverage in schools. The overall number of schools with a full-time officer on hand increased from 273 in 2021-2022 to 288 in the 2022-2023 school year. \nIn Calvert County, another candidate who is running for reelection, Antoine White, said he meets regularly with his board’s safety liaison and local sheriff’s department. White voted to increase the number of school resource officers in his district.\nBut another candidate in Calvert County, Paul Harrison, said he is not content with the lack of armed officers in six schools and pledged to try to fill those gaps.\nIn contrast, Montgomery County ended its school resource officer program in 2021 amid concerns that students of color were being disproportionately disciplined. The district now has a community engagement officer program, in which officers patrol near schools and enter schools as needed. \nA PTA president running for the school board in the county, Rita Montoya, said the officers allowed in schools must be properly vetted.\n“Providing opportunities for healthy and positive engagement between students and officers is another necessary step,” Montoya said.\nMore school districts opt for a constant, visible law enforcement presence. Worcester County Board of Education member Jon M. Andes touted his district as the first in the state to have school resource officers.\n“We need to continue work with our law enforcement partners, enhance our summer safe schools retreat, and strengthen our proactive approach to preventing problems,” said Andes, who is running for reelection.\nConversely, Gerry LaFemina worries about the use of officers in schools in Allegany County, where he is running for the school board.\n”I loathe the idea of making our schools seem like they’re under attack because that provides an atmosphere ripe for distraction,” he said. “I also worry about the use of police in the schools, which can often lead to escalation of problems rather than mediated solutions.”\nOther than LaFemina, none of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network survey questioned or opposed assigning police officers to schools. \nMore counselors?\nMany candidates made clear, though, that school resource officers can’t solve the school safety problem alone. Twenty-five candidates mentioned increased mental health or counseling intervention as an important step in their survey response.\n“Schools should prioritize not only physical safety but also students’ social and emotional well-being,” said Tiffini Andorful, a Prince George’s County school board candidate. “This could include increasing the number of support staff and providing access to resources and training to effectively handle conflicts. I also think there should be a greater emphasis on emergency preparedness and increased advocacy for gun control at higher levels.”\nMany also emphasized the importance of building a healthy school atmosphere beginning when students are young. \n“We really need to focus on social-emotional learning and fostering a culture of acceptance of others from the youngest grades and up,” said Erica McFarland, an Anne Arundel County candidate.\nMcFarland said she feels that this type of focus can help to prevent bullying, a common reason for students to feel unsafe at school.\nMeg Ricks, a candidate in Howard County, said increased counseling services would likely stem other problems, too.\n“We must start while students are young to give them tools for dealing with conflict and seeking help when needed,” she said in her survey response. “I would like to see more counselors in our schools so that we can provide students with productive solutions to the challenges they are facing.”\nAt the same time, 13 candidates statewide said that the secret to solving the school safety puzzle lies not just in school resource officers and mental health services, but in old-fashioned school discipline.\n“We need to re-address school discipline measures and take improved steps to reduce the threats and in some cases, violence,” Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County said. “Teaching and learning cannot take place in an environment (where) one feels unsafe.”",

    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network’s 2024 School Board Voter Guide. \n“FOCUS NOW! PHONES LATER,” blares the newest school cellphone policy out of Washington County. \nThis “clear message” debuted on the county’s website in August, kicking off the 2024 school year with stricter limitations on personal electronic devices. \nThat message is one that resonates with Maryland’s school board candidates. Of the 74 candidates who responded to the Local News Network’s campaign questionnaire, 64 favored strict restrictions on cellphones in schools, and only 10 expressed reservations about limiting cellphone use or touted their positive aspects. \nBoard candidates cited a number of reasons – ranging from disciplinary issues to cyberbullying to phone addiction – for ordering students to put their phones out of sight.\nSome candidates offered nuanced proposals for limiting cellphone use – but support for greater restrictions spans the state, from large counties to small.\n\nRita Montoya, a lawyer who is running for an at-large school board seat from Montgomery County, said the district’s cellphone policy should be “away all day” – which is the name of a pilot program in the district this year.\n“As a parent, I understand the need for some students to have a cellphone with them at school, but it should not be used at school so as to limit distractions and negative peer interactions including violence,” she said.\nWashington County already requires all devices to be off and out of sight during instructional hours in its schools. Robin Merchant Spickler, a former kindergarten teacher and current school board candidate in the western Maryland county, fully supports the new policy.\n“This has been a long time coming. It is in the best interest of the students’ well-being and their academic progress,” she said. “It will help the students learn in a positive and productive environment.”\nA growing trend\nSchools across the state have already begun implementing stricter cellphone policies in public schools. According to a survey conducted by the Capital News Service this fall, at least a third of Maryland school districts have tightened their cellphone regulations this school year alone. \nHowever, these policies vary. Some schools prohibit students from using their devices throughout the entire school day, while others, such as Anne Arundel County, allow high school students to use them during lunch only.\nSome counties have begun forcing students to lock away their phones. In Baltimore County, 16 middle and high schools have issued clear pouches in which students must insert their phones to make them harder to access during class time.\nAnnette Anderson, the deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, said there are good reasons for mimimizing cellphone use among youngsters.\n“What we know is that it’s shifting the way that the brains of the developing child is growing,” Anderson said. “There’s a lot of concern in terms of the mental health of our young people.”\nBetween 2008 and 2015, hospitals in the U.S. reported suicidal ideation or attempts among children and adolescents ages 14 to 18 almost doubled, according to a 2020 study. Published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the study delved into the relationship between youth cellphone and social media use and mental health.\nThe study found that internet addiction is “particularly associated” with self-harm and suicidal behavior. \nAnderson said cellphone use also hinders students’ ability to develop interpersonal connections vital to job performance later in life. \n“What’s happening actually is that students are so focused on this phone that’s in front of their faces that they’re not actually having interpersonal dialogue,” Anderson said. “They’re not having the kinds of conversations at the lunchroom, at the lunch table in their classrooms.”\nTeachers nationwide are worried about cellphone use, too, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center from June. The survey found that 72 percent of high school teachers alone cite cellphone distractions in the classroom as a “major problem.”\nMany school board candidates also said cellphones have become a distraction. \nIn Calvert County, cellphones are banned in classrooms, and school board candidate and former educator Michael Shisler backs that ban. \n“This problem did not happen overnight, and it will not be solved overnight,” said Shisler, who spent nearly 30 years as an elementary school principal. “Cellphones have moved beyond a distraction to being an addiction – an addiction that brings increased social pressures and the need for constant social validation.”\nAllegany County school board candidate and Frostburg State University professor Gerry LaFemina agreed. He said the impact cellphones and social media have on students is the most jarring problem in county schools that he hopes to address.\n“Besides being a distraction, the dopamine hit of responding to notifications can have an addictive effect on our students. This can lead to educational and disciplinary issues,” LaFemina said.\nLaFemina did not specify what policies he would implement if elected, but the county has light limitations on use in the classroom, often leaving it up to teacher discretion. \nSt. Mary’s County candidate Mary Washington, who has served on the board for the past 27 years, said she is pleased with the county’s new plan to restrict phone use during instructional time. \n“This change will focus on increasing learning and achievement, promoting a safe and orderly school, diminishing discipline referrals, and nourishing more face-to-face contact with each other,” Washington said. \nDifferent perspectives\nWhile most school board candidates throughout the state provided a variety of concerns surrounding cellphone use in schools, many had different perspectives on what a ban should look like in their county. \nOut of Prince George’s County, lawyer, substitute teacher and school board candidate Angela R. Jones said she supports tighter regulation but not a full ban. \n“I propose a balanced cellphone policy that allows limited use during non-instructional times, such as lunch and between classes while prohibiting use during lessons,” said Jones, the legislative director for the Maryland State Senate. “This approach respects students’ need for connectivity and emergency contact while minimizing distractions during instructional time.”\nIn addition to the social connectivity phones can provide students, some candidates cited the educational use of devices in schools, saying they can be used in the classroom in moderation. \nLetonya Smalls is also running for the school board in Charles County. She has a doctorate in education leadership and said she has seen students benefit directly from phone usage in the classroom. \n“I remember one of my students pulling out his cellphone to take a picture years ago. I asked what he was doing, and he said, ‘I am taking a picture of the homework, Ms. Smalls,’” Smalls said. “He smiled, and I honestly didn’t make a big deal out of it because I knew it worked for him. Each student is different, and each student learns differently.”\nSmalls proposed a strict policy enforced by teachers during instructional time but not a complete ban. However, like some other candidates, Smalls said she believes that students and parents should be involved in developing any new policy. She proposed a contract for cellphone use for both parents and students to review and sign.\nIn Frederick County, school board candidate Veronica Lowe took a similar stance.\n“I don’t believe in creating a policy without fully understanding the issues and concerns that led to its development,” said Lowe, former director of transportation for Frederick County Schools. “We need to gather a collaborative group that includes parents, students, teachers, support staff, administrators, bus drivers and community members to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.”\nLowe also brought up the intersection of school safety and cellphone policy and said she believes that in light of recent school shootings, students need to have a way to communicate in emergencies.\nAnd one candidate – Maisie T. Howard of Anne Arundel County – voiced concerns that a ban would do more harm than good, especially for special needs students, those from rural areas and those who thrive in virtual environments.\n“The cellphone is not the enemy,” she said. “For many of us, it is our only computer.”\nIn contrast, some candidates, like Ann O’Connor from Talbot County, believe in a full ban in elementary and middle schools, along with emergency access only in high schools. O’Connor, a former high school Spanish teacher and mother of six, said she believes a tougher phone policy could decrease mental health issues, bullying and distraction in schools.\n“If Talbot County wants to lead the way on protecting our kids from short attention spans and gaps in core knowledge, this is the No. 1 thing that needs to happen,” O’Connor said. \nAnd O’Connor said those most in the know about the county’s schools agree with her.\n“I have talked to a number of teachers about cellphone use in school, and they unanimously tell me the same thing,” O’Connor said. “Ban them.” \nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Letonya Smalls is running for the board of education in Prince George’s County. She is a candidate in Charles County.",

    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network’s 2024 School Board Voter Guide. \nColt Black is many things: a mortician, an emergency medical technician, a firefighter, a father, a husband and a candidate for the Frederick County Public School Board. He’s also a self-professed First Amendment absolutist. \nSo, when Black was asked about what material should be available to Frederick County students in their school libraries, his response followed suit. \n“I don’t support book bans,” he said. \nYet like many Maryland school board candidates, Black’s detailed views on the book issue are nuanced. In his vision for Frederick County Public Schools, any book, whether it be instructional or recreational, would be reviewed in committee and public hearings before making its way onto school shelves.\n“Books which contain extreme violence or are sexually explicit, which glorify these things with no academic value, should be removed,” Black said in response to a University of Maryland Local News Network questionnaire sent to all 109 school board candidates in the state. “All books, both instructional and library resources, should be reviewed by a committee and public comment accepted before allowing them or disallowing them in the educational setting.”\nBlack’s support for such a process isn’t unique in his county, or Maryland at large. Asked in a Local News Network survey if they favored book bans, 38 of the 74 candidates who responded to the LNN questionnaire said they favor a policy in which professionals are involved in making sure books are age-appropriate. Another 19 strongly opposed book bans without citing policies for reviewing books.\n“I will vote against book bans and the editing of curriculum based on personal beliefs,” said Sarah J. McDermott, who is running for the school board in Anne Arundel County’s District 4. “No topic should be banned from curriculum or libraries, provided that they are age appropriate, and I really trust our librarians and educators to determine that for their students.”\nHowever, 17 candidates were open to banning books that parents find objectionable.\n\n“I am running for the Board of Education because I would like to review our curriculum and establish age-appropriate educational materials for K-12 and eliminate any materials that sexualize children and are not appropriate for minors,” said Elena Brewer, a school board candidate from St. Mary’s County. Brewer is one of 19 candidates in the state that won an endorsement from the 1776 Project PAC, a conservative group whose founder, Ryan James Girdusky, says on the group website that he created the PAC after objecting to books on race issues that a teacher read to his godson’s class.\nA patchwork of policies\nAmid parents, activists and school boards challenging books across the state, Gov. Wes Moore signed the Freedom to Read Act into law earlier this year in an attempt to put an end to book bans in Maryland public schools. \nThe law prohibits public schools from excluding or removing materials from their school libraries because of the origin, background or views of the author. It also states that material cannot be removed because of partisan, ideological or religious disapproval. School systems must adopt book review policies where challenged books remain on the shelves until the review process concludes.\nHowever, the legislation fails to affect the majority of books banned throughout the state. According to Steve Wernick, the director of curriculum and instruction for Carroll County Public Schools, the bill only mandates that counties have adequate processes in place for the removal of library content – and because Carroll County already had a committee in place that had banned books, its decisions stand.\nA unanimous school board vote removed over 60 books in Carroll County – 21 permanently. The banned titles include:\n\n“And They Lived,” a gay-themed young adult novel by Steven Salvatore.\n“Identical” by Ellen Hopkins, a novel about a young woman sexually abused by her father.\n“Kingdom of Ash,” “House of Earth and Blood,” and “A Court of Frost and Starlight” – popular fantasy novels by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nMeanwhile, Wicomico County banned “All Boys Are Blue,” George M. Johnson’s  coming-of-age novel about a young queer boy. Frederick County banned Hopkins’ “Triangles,” which publisher Simon & Schuster described as a “surprisingly erotic” novel that includes adultery about three women’s intersecting friendships   \n And Queen Anne’s County banned “Harbor Me,” Jacqueline Woodson’s novel about multicultural kids navigating their way through a multitude of problems, which was a New York Times Book Review’s “Kids Notables” selection for 2018.\nWith November’s school board elections approaching, the issue of book bans will once again appear on the ballot in the form of races between conservative candidates and their opponents. Candidates endorsed by the conservative 1776 Project PAC are running in nine Maryland counties.\nThe Carroll County precedent\nIn Maryland’s largely liberal central corridor, Carroll County has always been an outlier. Jutting southward from the Mason-Dixon line, it’s surrounded by liberal enclaves and Frederick County, a former Republican stronghold that flipped blue in the 2020 presidential election for the first time since 1964. \nAs demographics shift and the Democratic party strengthens its regional claim, Carroll County remains stubbornly independent. While it isn’t uncommon to have a couple of books challenged over the course of a year, Carroll County’s 21 permanent removals drew headlines earlier this year.\nOne of the county’s board of education candidates, Amanda Jozkowski, said she opposes such actions.\n“While there may be rare instances where a book is deemed unsuitable for the school library, these decisions should be based on clear, consistent criteria focused on educational value, not on censorship or ideological preferences,” she said in responding to the candidate questionnaire.\nJozkowski said Carroll County is a proving ground for conservative policies – especially within schools. She noted that the county has a large and active Moms for Liberty chapter that is helping chapters in other counties. Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that stresses parents’ rights, burst onto the scene in 2021 and has led the fight for book bans in many school districts.\nTo offer a different future for Carroll County educators and students, Jozkowski is collaborating with fellow board candidate Muri Lynn Dueppen on the Slate for Student Success, a joint candidacy that highlights the pair’s shared values and encourages voters to mark their names at the top of November’s ballot. On its website, opposition to book banning is listed as one of the pair’s core values. \nJozkowski hopes that voters see her as an alternative to the conservative candidates she opposes. She said she believes that many Carroll County residents are tired of the “politically motivated orientation” of the current school board. \nBut, in a county that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 60 years, her success is far from guaranteed. Among her challengers is Kristen Zihmer, a 38-year-old small business owner who called herself a “conservative lifelong resident” of Carroll County and who, according to the Baltimore Sun, has been endorsed by Moms for Liberty.\nZihmer listed Ronald Reagan as the political figure she admired most and said: “My goal is to uphold the family and community values that make our county exceptional.” Asked about book bans, she said: “When materials are open to question, I default to parental consent…I would state unequivocally that I do not condone materials that are sexually gratuitous in nature or feature extreme sexual content.”\nA debate in Howard County\nIn March, the Howard County chapter of Moms For Liberty laid out plans for its latest initiative: the elimination of 46 books from Howard County Public Schools’ shelves, following in Carroll County’s footsteps.\nWhile the chapter’s measures have failed thus far, one of its early supporters is now running for a spot on the county’s board of education. Trent Kittleman, a former state delegate who lost re-election in 2022, requested to be taken off the Moms for Liberty rolls when she began her school board campaign, Baltimore Fishbowl reported in March.\nBut her views on the issue remain staunchly conservative. She decried a 2021 ban on six Dr. Seuss books with harmful stereotypes, but she remains concerned about other kinds of books..\n“The misnomer ‘book banning’ being criticized these days is an effort by many parents to have certain books removed from school libraries due to what they consider explicitly sexual content,” Kittleman said in response to a Local News Network questionnaire. “It is not unreasonable to have explicitly sexual content ‘that serves no redeeming social purpose,’ removed from the schools.” \nKittleman offers the Democratic stronghold a new vision for its public schools, one in line with the Republican values she touted during her eight years in the Maryland House of Delegates. One of her opponents, incumbent Jen Mallo, offers the opposite.\n“A diverse and inclusive set of library books are critical to have in our schools,” said Mallo, who chairs the Howard County Board of Education. “We need to actively work to include these materials despite extremist fear mongering and demands for removal.”\n\nThe issue goes to court \nMontgomery County’s battle between conservative parents and school board members looks a little different than those in the rest of the state. In September, a group of parents filed a petition asking that the Supreme Court review the school board’s refusal to allow parents to opt their elementary children out of classes using LGBTQ+ books, citing a violation of their First Amendment rights.\nThe books are part of the district’s effort to be more inclusive by adding titles with LGBTQ+ characters in their kindergarten through 12th-grade curriculum. \nBrenda M. Diaz, one of the county’s school board candidates, is siding with those parents. \nDiaz, a social studies teacher at Fusion Global Academy with more than 20 years of education experience, said that since Maryland state law allows parents to request exemptions for their children from certain portions of the sex education curriculum, she would extend these same rights to parents for books their children can access. \n“Each school should be able to determine with their body of parents which books should be removed,” she said in her response to the LNN candidate questionnaire.\nYet Lynne Harris, a board member running for re-election in Montgomery County, believes public opinion shouldn’t be a factor when determining which books students can access\nHarris, currently the vice president of the Montgomery County Board of Education, strongly supports the county’s LGBTQ+ curriculum.\n“If families want to restrict the books their students read, they have many avenues to do that,” Harris told the Local News Network in August, “but imposing these choices and personal judgments on thousands of others is not appropriate.”",

    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network’s 2024 School Board Voter Guide. \nThe culture war erupting around the nation about transgender rights is being fought in Maryland’s school districts, too.\nSchool boards that set policy for those districts face a dilemma: Do they prioritize a student’s autonomy over their identity or the parents’ right to know who that child really is? \nIn previous years, some school districts enacted policies that allowed transgender or gender-nonconforming students to choose their pronouns, while also not informing the parents of their decisions. \nYet in deep blue Maryland, 32 of 74 school board candidates who responded to a Local News Network survey indicated that these policies go a step too far. Nineteen of those candidates are running for board seats in the 10 Maryland counties that have chapters of Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that stresses parents’ rights.\n“Parents should be fully informed about everything happening at school involving their child. There should NEVER be a situation where information is withheld from parents,” wrote Carroll County school board candidate Kristen Zihmer, who has been endorsed by Moms for Liberty.\nA slightly smaller number of candidates – 29 – prioritize creating a “safe and inclusive” environment for students, even if that requires withholding information from parents. \n\nAnne Arundel County school board member Joanna Bache Tobin, who is seeking re-election, said students succeed in school when they have a sense of belonging. \n“Enabling students to determine for themselves how they wish to be addressed and referred to is critical to that safe and inclusive environment, and therefore to student achievement,” said Tobin, a consultant and parent in the Anne Arundel County public school system. \nYet the issue remains sensitive. As if to prove it, 13 candidates either refused to answer the LNN survey question about pronouns or did so in a way that did not take a stand on the issue.\nPronouns: A history\nAlthough discourse and vitriol around pronouns have become increasingly common in the past few years, the usage of “they” as a gender-neutral personal pronoun can be dated back to the 14th century in a French poem, according to a video guide from LBGTQ@MIT.\nCenturies later, Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary added “they” as a singular nonbinary pronoun in 2019, citing its prevalence in discourse and rebutting the common argument that opponents have used: that they/them pronouns are grammatically incorrect because it’s applying singular use to a plural word.  \nThe Biden administration recently made headlines when it rewrote regulations under Title IX – the federal ban on sex discrimination – to cover bias against gender identity or sexual orientation. This federal civil rights law prevents sex-based discrimination in any school that receives federal funding.  \nThis rewrite would require that schools refer to students by the pronouns they use. However, federal lawsuits have blocked the change at least temporarily in 26 Republican-led states.\nIn contrast, many counties in Maryland have embraced a progressive policy on pronouns. For the 2020-2021 school year, Montgomery County Public Schools drafted a guideline for student gender identity that encourages employees to make support plans for transgender and gender nonconforming students. This approach allows students to decide on their identity at school, whether it be their preferred name or pronouns. \n“Prior to contacting a student’s parent/guardian, the principal or identified staff member should speak with the student to ascertain the level of support the student either receives or anticipates receiving from home,” the guideline reads. \nThat policy also prompted a federal lawsuit. Conservative parent groups argued the guidelines violate the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of due process under the law by restricting the parents’ ability to direct care and control education for their minor children. A group of three parents took their argument to court with the support of the conservative National Legal Foundation. \nA federal court dismissed the case in 2022, and a federal appeals court did the same the following year. The courts ruled that the parents didn’t have legal standing to have their case heard. The parents appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and the court dismissed the case again in May. \nHowever, the parent group noted in its petition that similar lawsuits have been filed across the nation. And Frederick County candidate Jaime Brennan, the former chairwoman of the county’s Moms for Liberty chapter, argues that such policies remain in legal jeopardy.\n“We are seeing districts across the country be sued for policies like this,” Brennan said. “I think it is only a matter of time before they are subject to huge judgments, not to mention the defense costs for these bad policies.”\n‘Age-inappropriate’\nElena Brewer, a school board candidate from St. Mary’s County, said she believes that allowing the usage of pronouns diminishes the rights of other students because it is “age-inappropriate” language. Her campaign issues consist of parental rights, education not indoctrination and age-appropriate curricula. \n“Schools are for education, not sexualization,” said Brewer, one of 19 Maryland candidates endorsed this year by the 1776 Project PAC, a conservative group that emphasizes parental rights and criticizes “woke” ideology. \nFor others, policies of nondisclosure undermine the relationship between parents and children. \n“If we are not informing parents of students’ decisions about their preferred pronouns and maybe questions about their identity, what other aspects of their school life are we not informing parents?” said Ann O’Connor, a school board candidate from Talbot County, who also received a 1776 Project PAC endorsement. \nThis belief in parental rights stands at the center of a conservative movement that says it is trying to save public school students from liberal indoctrination. \nHoward County school board candidate Trent Kittleman said that like other conservative candidates, she strongly opposes policies that allow schools to withhold information from parents when a child chooses alternate pronouns..  Kittleman is a former state delegate who lost re-election in 2022 and asked to be taken off the Moms for Liberty rolls when she began her school board campaign, Baltimore Fishbowl reported in March.\n“It is imperative to recognize that parents hold the ultimate responsibility for raising their children; attempts to undermine this fundamental role are both misguided and potentially harmful,” Kittleman said in response to the LNN candidate questionnaire.\nKittleman’s website says that she fought against progressive legislation for eight years in the Maryland legislature and that she believes in a system that prioritizes parental involvement. \n‘Safe and supported’\nThe use of gender-neutral pronouns is increasingly common, with recent studies showing that 56% of Generation Z respondents know someone who uses gender neutral pronouns, a National Institutes of Health article said. Advocates of the approach say using an individual’s correct pronouns can act as a sign of respect.  \nAllegany County school board candidate Max Green said it’s not the role of teachers to tell parents what pronouns students are using in school.\n“Every student deserves to feel safe and supported in school, regardless of their identity,” Green said. “Using preferred pronouns fosters an inclusive environment and allows students to feel accepted. Importantly, this practice causes no harm to others — it simply reflects respect for the individual.”\nMultiple candidates cited the importance of respecting pronouns for the safety and health of transgender or gender non-conforming students.  \nMontgomery County incumbent candidate Lynne Harris emphasized the vulnerability of LGBTQ+ youth to bullying or rejection from family. \n“I am proud that Montgomery County Public Schools policy is to provide a welcoming and supportive space for students, to support them in expressing their gender identity, and to partner with families in supporting LGBTQ+ students EXCEPT when the student tells us they will not be safe if family are informed,” Harris said. \nThe Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ+ youths, found in a 2020 national survey that transgender and nonbinary individuals who had their pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those that didn’t have their pronouns respected. \n“If we can save lives by using preferred pronouns and names, then it is incumbent on us to do so,” said Jen Mallo, a Howard County Board of Education member who is running for re-election. “It is not only a good thing to do, but also the right thing to do.”\nSeveral candidates also said it is OK for schools to not disclose a student’s preferred pronouns to parents. They said doing so makes school a safe space for students. \n“Unfortunately, there are still situations where a child faces being kicked out of their home or ostracized for coming out to their family. Our duty as a school system is to support the child,” said Erica McFarland, a school board candidate from Anne Arundel County. \nDespite the debate over pronouns, none of these candidates surveyed chose gender identity and pronouns as the most significant issue affecting schools today. In Carroll County – where conservative school board members have voted to remove 21 books from library shelves – candidate Muri Lynn Dueppen said it’s time for the board to focus on something else.  \n“The focus of the board needs to return to academics instead of the deeply divisive culture wars,” Dueppen said.",

    "content": "Classrooms across Maryland are a bit more quiet this fall, with students under new rules to keep their phones off and out of sight. \nAt least a third of Maryland public schools have tightened up the rules this fall, according to a Capital News Service survey conducted this month.\nMeanwhile, public schools in and around Baltimore are cracking down on phones during instruction – and, in some cases, even on the bus. \nIn Caroline County, on the eastern shore of Maryland, public schools have a new pilot program in two middle schools. It requires students to place their phones in locked pouches. The pouches stay with the students but remain locked until the end of the school day.\n“Today’s youth battle constant distraction caused by cell phone alerts and messaging that interrupt their ability to focus,” Supt. Derek L. Simmons said in a recent notice to students and parents. He said this “creates a negative impact on school culture and learning.” \nElsewhere, administrators are getting creative about persuading students to go along with the plan. \nIn St. Mary’s County, Supt. Scott Smith recently released a video describing the district’s new plan to limit the distractions caused by cell phones. \nIn the video, he comically stops midway through his presentation of the new rules to take out his phone and text, showing students how difficult it can be to have a conversation when they are disengaged and on their phones. \n“Hold on, just wait a second, I’m just going to text him real fast,” Smith said in the video, pretending to send a message. \n“That’s really rude isn’t it?” he then pointed out. “We’re supposed to be having a conversation, and I’m interrupting myself and I’m getting on my phone and I’m texting.” \n“I’m not really here right?” Smith said. “I’m kind of distracted.”\nSince the start of the school year, in St. Mary’s County, they have confiscated around 30 cell phones per day, Smith told the school board in a recent meeting. That’s out of 10,000 students, he said at the meeting. \n“We have had many conversations about the joy of being in a classroom without the distraction of cell phones,” Smith said, adding that he and his staff “continue to work with our secondary students about the joy and some of the challenges of cellular devices and how we can maximize our joy and fun in life.”",

    "content": "PAROLE, Md.–Local libraries are currently facing almost a dozen different book challenges,  with critics of stories like Bye-Bye Binary and The Blackbird Girls calling for their removal from shelves.\nBut these books and other challenged stories are still available on the shelves in Anne Arundel County, thanks in part to protections county officials have recently put in place.\nThe Anne Arundel public libraries this month became the first library system in the state of Maryland to be designated a “book sanctuary,” dedicated to collecting and protecting endangered books, and holding book talks and other events designed to make them broadly accessible.\n“We want to preserve everyone’s ability to read the things they want,” said Rachel Myers, the branch manager of Discoveries: The Library at the Mall, one of the Anne Arundel libraries, located in this town near Annapolis.\nDeclaring the library a book sanctuary, Myers said, shows that, “We are steadfast in our dedication to being a place that is protective of books and of people’s freedom to read,”\nAfter beginning in 2022 in Chicago, sanctuaries have since spread to twelve other library systems in North America.\nIn Anne Arundel, the library’s Board of Trustees decision follows the passing of the Freedom to Read act last spring, which Gov. Wes Moore signed into law. The act says that any library receiving funding from the state has to follow certain standards and can’t, among other things, remove material due to partisan, doctrinal, ideological or religious disapproval.\nOver the past five years, Maryland public libraries have seen a dramatic increase in staff threats and bomb threats related to book bannings, according to the county website. More than half of them have also faced book challenges, officials said.\nThese attempts have been happening “not just in our state, but in our county of Anne Arundel,” said Maryland Del. Dana Jones, a Democrat from the county. She is author and sponsor of the act, and spoke at a recent press conference held during the national observance of Banned Books Week.\nDuring the event, County Executive Steuart Pittman also declared the entirety of Anne Arundel county to be a book sanctuary.\nOnce the announcement concluded, Myers rang a big silver bell to announce that it was time for “Banned Book Storytime,” featuring a book called Grandad’s Camper, by Harry Woodgate.\nWoodgate’s illustrated story – about a little girl traveling with her granddad after his male partner’s death – has been challenged nationwide.\nBut now it finds refuge in Anne Arundel County, and that means something to librarians.\n“To have that backup as a professional, you can’t understate how much that means,” Myers said. “It’s not just us out here alone trying to do it. It’s backed by so many people.”",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Md.— A federal judge on Monday is scheduled to hear arguments over a request by a University of Maryland student organization to prevent the university from canceling an Oct. 7 campus vigil that would commemorate the lives lost in the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the past year.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations and Palestine Legal filed a federal lawsuit Sept. 17 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of the student group, the University of Maryland’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, challenging the university’s cancellation of the vigil.\nThe suit accuses the University of Maryland, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents and Dr. Darryll Pines, president of the University of Maryland, College Park, of “engaging in unconstitutional content-based discrimination.”\nThe hearing on an injunction will be before U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nPines and the University System of Maryland released letters Sept. 1 canceling all student-led “expressive events” scheduled for Oct. 7, which they said would be replaced by university-sponsored activities “dedicated to discourse and reflection” at the University of Maryland and all other universities in the Maryland system.\n“The First Amendment does not allow campus officials to establish free-expression black-out days, even on occasions that may be emotional or politically polarizing,” Gadeir Abbas, CAIR’s national deputy litigation director, said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Maryland, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed an amicus brief Wednesday in support of the University of Maryland’s Students for Justice in Palestine’s lawsuit. The free speech organizations argue that the Oct. 7 restriction is an unconstitutional and unreasonable attempt to “silence speech about Israel and Palestine.”\nThe student group’s leadership told Capital News Service that their Oct. 7 event planned to include teach-ins, student speakers, interfaith prayers and a vigil.\n“By canceling our event, the University of Maryland has continued to deliberately erase the Palestinian perspective from campus,” Daniela Colombi, a board member for the University of Maryland’s Students for Justice in Palestine, said. “We are horrified beyond words at the obstruction of the advancement of equality, justice and liberation.”\nThe University of Maryland’s Students for Justice in Palestine requested and received approval July 31 to host an “awareness event” on Oct. 7 on McKeldin Mall, a focal point of the College Park campus. Two days later, after the reservation was publicly listed in the university’s student registration system, the university administration requested to meet with the student group, the lawsuit says.\nIn an Aug. 19 meeting with Pines and Dr. Patricia Perillo, vice president for student affairs, board members from the student group explained the purpose of the event. Pines and Perillo asserted that “they had been receiving pressure from groups inside and outside the university to cancel UMD-SJP’s reservation, but they are committed to protecting the free speech of students,” according to the lawsuit.\n“You are likely to see and hear expressive activity on campus on issues you may or may not agree with…as a public institution, we cannot discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint, and must therefore allow such groups to be heard,” Pines said in an Aug. 26 letter to the campus community.\nThe university continued to receive backlash from some pro-Israel groups in the following days.\nA petition started by End Jewish Hate calling on the University of Maryland to rescind its permission garnered nearly 30,000 signatures, according to the lawsuit. On Aug. 28, Perillo told the student group that parties outside the university were concerned the event would “glorify violence,” the lawsuit says.\nOn Sept. 1, university administrators revoked the University of Maryland’s Students for Justice in Palestine’s Oct. 7 reservation, citing student safety concerns.\nThe lawsuit claims that the campus-wide bans were based on a viewpoint issue, challenging the legal basis that Pines provided in his Sept. 1 letter.\nThe lawsuit uses Pines’ own words from the Sept. 1 letter to argue that the university system violates the First Amendment. Despite emphasizing safety concerns, Pines said that he “requested a routine and targeted safety assessment for this day” and the University of Maryland Police Department assured him that “there is no immediate or active threat to prompt this assessment.”\nThe University of Maryland Police Department and the University of Maryland’s Office of the President declined to comment on the lawsuit. Mike Lurie, the University System of Maryland’s media relations and web manager, told CNS that “the University System of Maryland does not comment on pending litigation.”\nGene Policinski, a senior fellow for the First Amendment at the Freedom Forum, told CNS that for the University System of Maryland’s ban to be constitutional, the defendants will have to prove that their decision was based on significant safety concerns, rather than the student group’s views and that an alternative method of expression would be provided.\nRabbi Ari Israel, executive director of Maryland Hillel, told CNS: “We believe the university emphasized being thoughtful about student safety and are appreciative of the university’s decision regarding student gatherings on October 7th.” He also expressed gratitude for Pines and the administration’s “supportive leadership as Jewish life and Maryland Hillel continue to thrive on campus.”\nThe University of Maryland’s Jewish Student Union and Terps for Israel told CNS that while they “respect all parties’ right to pursue legal actions,” they believe “the university’s decision to cancel all events for both groups was the best decision under the circumstances.”\nThe University of Maryland’s Students for Justice in Palestine’s board members told CNS that they worry this ban, if unchallenged, would set a precedent, inhibiting pro-Palestinian speech for students across the country.\n“As UMD-SJP, we have a responsibility to our fellow peers at this university and to students nationwide to stand up for our collective and constitutional rights to free expression,” Colombi said.\nReactions to the ban from student groups and officials have been mixed.\n“We are relieved that SJP will no longer be able to appropriate the suffering of our family and friends to fit their false and dangerous narrative,” the Jewish Student Union, Israeli American Council, Maryland Hillel and Terps for Israel said in a joint statement on Instagram. “While we are reassured by this decision, we are distraught that it had to be made at all. We wish that we could have utilized campus space to grieve together as a community.”\nPolicinski said judges often defer to school administrators “because they’re balancing the rights of others’ First Amendment rights in the process of education.”\n“These (cases) are often very, very fact-dependent on the specific circumstances on campuses, but any time speech is restricted, I think it merits a very close look at, what the lawsuit mentions, very strict scrutiny,” he said.",

    "content": "Maryland is counting on private child care providers to take part as the state expands its pre-K program — but many providers don’t plan on becoming involved.\nIn a spring survey of the state’s child care providers conducted by the Local News Network, only 12.9% of respondents said they plan to or were already involved in the pre-K program created under the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s expansive education reform plan.\nMore than a third of the 256 respondents said they were unsure whether they will participate in the pre-K expansion — but nearly 40% said they would not participate. \nThe pre-K expansion plan under the 10-year Blueprint for Maryland’s Future aims to expand pre-K enrollment to all 4-year-olds and all lower-income 3-year-olds through a “mixed delivery system” involving both public schools and private child care operations.\nBut many child care providers who responded to the survey said they are reluctant to take part in the program. Some said they would have trouble finding staff for a pre-K operation. Others said they didn’t want to get the additional education required to qualify for the program. And others said they didn’t want the Maryland State Department of Education to be more involved in their business than it already is.\nPatti Smith, the director of Greenway Learning Center in Greenbelt, said she’s also concerned developmental differences between 3- and 4-year-olds would make managing a pre-K program difficult.\nAsked if she would take part in the pre-K expansion, Smith said: “It’s more ‘no’ than ‘maybe,’ just for the first year because I want to see what other providers do. And I don’t have faith in MSDE. You know, I don’t think they have all the answers — so I’m not ready to be that guinea pig.” \nThe mixed delivery system\nThe Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which the General Assembly passed in 2021, calls for widespread changes throughout the state’s public schools.\nAnd one of the most wide-ranging changes is a vast expansion of early childhood education. The plan calls for state-funded pre-K to be available to all low-income 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 fiscal year. Pre-K will be free to all 3- and 4-year-olds from families that earn up to 300% of the federal poverty level. A sliding scale will determine what families with incomes between 300% and 600% of the federal poverty level will pay for pre-K, while higher-income families will pay for it in full.\n“This is another step in the right direction to ensure pre-kindergarten programs continue to grow and create more opportunities for our children and families, especially those who have been historically underserved,” Maryland State Board of Education President Clarence  Crawford said in 2023.\nWhile 40% of the state’s eligible youngsters were enrolled in pre-K in the 2022-23 school year, the Blueprint aims to double that percentage in a decade. Given that 30,718 young Marylanders were enrolled in pre-K in 2022-23, the change means tens of thousands of additional children will be enrolled in pre-K in the coming years.\nState officials have set a goal of having private providers fill half the state’s pre-K slots by the 2026-27 school year. \n“And part of the reason for that is … there is not enough space in the public schools to actually provide all those slots for pre-K,” Rachel Hise, the executive director of the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, said at a conference of school principals late last year.\nHise acknowledged, though, that the mixed-delivery effort faces some major challenges, including one that haunts the state’s entire child care system.\n“The pandemic really drove a number of child care providers out of business,” she said.\nA widespread reluctance\nOn top of a statewide shortage of child care providers — which the Local News Network at the University of Maryland documented earlier in this series — education officials face another significant challenge in creating that mixed delivery system. The Local News Network survey this spring found many remaining child care providers are either reluctant to participate in the pre-K expansion or are refusing to take part.\n\n\n\nSeveral child care providers said joining the pre-K program would make a hard job even more difficult.\n“I'm overwhelmed with the day-to-day operational issues,” such as staff turnover and increased operating costs, said Dana Miller of Little Smiling Faces Childcare in Mitchellville, in Prince George’s County. “Having to find a qualified teacher (for pre-K) would just add more issues.”\nGiven the widespread concern about a pre-K staffing shortage, the General Assembly this year amended the Blueprint by creating several new pathways for people interested in becoming pre-K teachers or teacher assistants. The legislation, which Gov. Wes Moore subsequently signed, exempts pre-K teachers assistants with more than five years of experience from a Blueprint requirement that they have an associate's degree.\nNevertheless, the state's pre-K expansion still faces other challenges.\nMichele Stritch, owner and operator of Michele Stritch Family Child Care in Dundalk, said in response to the survey that she is reluctant to participate in the pre-K because she doesn’t know what it entails. She also noted her center faces financial challenges and concerns about state regulations.\n“I am inclined to not participate because I do not want the state being even more involved in how I run my business,” Stritch said.\nThe results of the LNN survey showed the percentage of child care providers who want to take part in the pre-K program — 12.9% — is exactly the same as the percentage of those who had never heard of it.\n“I would love to participate but have never heard of the program,” said Charnetta Bailey, owner and operator of Children Learning Wonders in Ellicott City.\nA publicity push?\nTold about the survey results, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Education, Raven Hill, indicated better publicity is the key to making sure more child care providers decide to offer pre-K.\n“MSDE continues to invite private providers to participate in PUSH to Pre-K webinars to increase awareness of publicly funded Pre-K and provide accurate information and support regarding Pre-K grant opportunities and requirements,” Hill said in a written response to questions submitted by the Local News Network. “MSDE will continue to encourage local education agencies to engage private providers in their areas about pre-K opportunities and the pre-K grant program benefits to children and families.”\nIn addition, the state is tweaking its grant awards program to make more child care facilities eligible for pre-K funding, Hill said.\nTiffany Jones, owner of Precious Moments Family Childcare  in Rockville, said she plans on participating in the expansion program. However, she said it’s difficult for many child care providers to understand the state’s pre-K effort. \n“The requirements to participate in pre-K expansion are very challenging for the average family child care provider,” she said. “So while pre-K is a wonderful program, they need the spaces in family child care for the system to really work — but there are a ton of requirements for providers (that are) very difficult.”\nEven so, some child care providers said they plan on taking part in the pre-K expansion because doing so is important for the survival of their business. After all, if they lose 3- and 4-year-olds to either public schools offering pre-K or to other providers, that means fewer enrollees and lower revenue.\n“I feel the school is taking all of the 4-year-olds and some of the 3-year-olds,” said Laurie Arnold, owner of Laurie Arnold Home Daycare in Frederick, who plans to take part in the pre-K program. “In order to keep my numbers up, I have to adjust.”\nIn time, despite the fact that she said she doesn’t want to be a “guinea pig,” Patti Smith of the Greenway Learning Center may end up adjusting, too. \nShe said she’s taking a wait-and-see attitude toward joining the pre-K expansion and may join it eventually. But she said she’s afraid those providers who decided to take part starting this year may have a difficult confrontation with reality when the next school year starts.\n“Come September, they're gonna go: ‘Oh, we don't have enough room. We don't have enough teachers,’ ” Smith said. “I do think they've bitten off more than they can chew.”\nLocal News Network director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.\nClarification: An earlier version of this story failed to mention legislation signed by Gov. Wes Moore in April that will allow teachers aides with five years experience to be exempt from the state requirement that they hold an associate's degree or a child development certification to work in a state-sanctioned pre-K.",

    "content": "When Stephanie Jovine searched for child care for her nearly 4-year-old daughter LuzMarie in Prince George’s County in 2015, she found two options, both of them bad. Jovine couldn’t afford the first one, and the second denied the young girl snacks and then sheets for sleeping.\n“I was so upset, you know, it was so hard to trust anyone,” said Jovine, a teacher in the District of Columbia Public Schools at the time.\nAfter six months of searching, Jovine found a grandmother who ran a small before-and-after care service, LiLi’s Child Care Center, in Temple Hills. The times the program was open aligned perfectly with Jovine’s needs.\n“She’s a godsend, for real,” said Jovine, who’s now 33.\nJovine’s arduous search for child care is not unique — and it would not even be her last search. Interviews with several Maryland families showed that while finding child care is hard, finding a facility that fits a family’s needs and budget is even harder.\nMaryland offers a rating system to help parents select the right child care facility, but providers say the rating system is difficult to navigate. Most parents interviewed by the Local News Network said they never looked at the state rating system.\nSimilarly, the state offers a generous scholarship program to help pay for child care, but providers complain they often have to wait months for the state to pay for child care for those scholarship recipients. Parents like Jovine struggle with the scholarship program, too.\nThe complications of finding child care in Maryland often leave families waiting for a place for their child, and that can lead to trouble, said Doug Lent, communications director for Maryland Family Network, which helps parents find child care and helps providers manage their businesses. \n“When you’re on that waiting list, that’s when you’re more likely to be tempted to rely on unlicensed care, unregulated care, and get into a situation that’s maybe not safe or maybe not high quality,” Lent said.\nThe ratings dilemma\nLinda Garey woke up at 6 a.m. on a springtime Saturday at her home in Dundalk to create a communication board for the autistic children she cares for daily in her home. Eleven hours later, she was still working on the project. She isn’t paid for the time she spends preparing her classroom.\nGarey is a level-3 provider with Maryland EXCELS, the child care quality rating system in the state that offers a top rating of 5 to the state’s top child care centers. Garey created a 65-page handbook outlining her teaching philosophy. She also assists other programs with their handbooks.\n“I’ve typed probably about 20 to 30 handbooks and turned them in for other people, right? And they’re all level 5,” she said.\nEXCELS – which stands for “Excellence Counts in Early Learning and School Age Care” – is an optional program for licensed child care providers. It offers them training and guidance and, if they qualify for it, a rating that parents can refer to when choosing a place to care for their child.\nThe Maryland EXCELS rating is based on five categories: licensing, staff qualifications, accreditation, developmentally appropriate practices and administrative policies. The highest overall rating a facility can get is the lowest rating it gets in any of those five categories.\nAnd even though Garey has more than 20 years of experience, her lack of national accreditation as a child care provider means she can’t go higher than level 3. \nGarey is working on getting her child development associate credential and becoming accredited — but she won’t be submitting that information to Maryland EXCELS. She said whenever she submits new documents and information to the Maryland State Department of Education, it goes to waste.\n“’I turned in some information about 20 times and it was denied,” she said.\nState officials insist they are trying to help. Jena Smith, the director of quality improvement initiatives at the state’s Division of Early Childhood, said quality assurance specialists work with each child care facility to improve its quality rating. \nThe Maryland State Department of Education also publishes a provider toolkit that outlines the documents necessary to rise up the ratings ladder, Smith said. The requirements for each level build on the last, she said.\n“It’s a scaffold, and so that’s really how our quality assurance specialists work with our programs,” Smith said. “They help them assess where they currently are and where they want to go.”\nSince January 2020, the number of level-5 providers in Maryland has increased by 9.6%, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. However, 15 of the state’s 24 jurisdictions have lost level-5 providers, and providers overall appear to have mixed feelings about the EXCELS program.\nAsked to rate the EXCELS program’s effectiveness on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being least effective and 5 being most effective, the 256 child care providers who replied to a Local News Network survey gave the program an average rating of 3.\n“I answered 3 because part of the program, I feel, has been extremely helpful, such as writing policies for guidance (on) nutrition and such,” Cheryl Thomsen, a child care provider in Salisbury, wrote in her survey response. “I did obtain accreditation but found it was very difficult to actually follow all the requirements properly on a daily basis.”\nA difficult search\nJovine moved from Prince George’s County to Waldorf, in Charles County, in 2020 and left teaching. Two years later, she returned to the District of Columbia Public Schools system while pregnant with her second child — only to discover searching for child care was still difficult and time-consuming.\n “I was looking and looking and looking for child care,” she said.\nJovine experienced exactly what other young mothers have experienced in recent years. She went on a frantic search for child care without referring to the state’s EXCELS ratings.\nPriya Mahfooz’s son Zakir was born in May 2019. She sent Zakir to a child care facility near the family home in Clarksburg, in Montgomery County, a few months later. But that operation shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, never to reopen. \nDesperate for child care, Mahfooz and a friend banded together to hire the teacher who ran that closed facility to look after their children. Each family paid the teacher $425 a week.\nIn the summer of 2021, Mahfooz decided to send Zakir back to a child care facility. During her search, Mahfooz said, she didn’t rely on Maryland EXCELS or the state inspection reports.\n“When you’re searching, it’s really just whatever you’re being fed in your feeds,” Mahfooz said. “You’re thinking about price, location, [online] ratings.”\nMahfooz found a child care slot for Zakir later that summer in Germantown and then enrolled him in Green Valley Montessori School in September 2021.\nMeanwhile, Javiera King, an administrator at the University of Maryland, had to hire a nanny to take care of her young daughter, Layla, while the family searched for a slot in a child care facility.\nWhile pregnant, “I had to put myself on a waitlist already because most day cares have a waitlist a year out,” she said.\nKing’s nanny gave her two weeks notice in December 2023. That meant King had to quickly piece together a schedule where family members took turns caring for her daughter, who was 11 months old at the time. The family then found a child care facility that had a part-time slot for Layla, meaning the family’s piecemeal plan for caring for the young girl would continue. \nFinally, in February, Layla’s part-time slot at that facility became full-time.\n“We were really lucky with how everything played out for us,” King said.\nJovine wasn’t so lucky. When she was five months pregnant with her second child, she called 12 child care facilities. All of them had a waiting list of a year or more for infants.\n Her daughter Lily was born at the end of February 2023, and Jovine finished the school year on maternity leave. She had to go back to work in August, but the earliest availability at most nearby child care facilities was in October.\n“There was one spot that had an availability. I wasn’t too satisfied with it,” Jovine said.\nThere were few toys and learning tools. The outdoor play equipment was dirty and the facility had no curriculum for promoting development in infants, Jovine said.\nShe found another option on a billboard. Jovine called that facility and when she found they had a spot, she took it. She only took three days off work to care for Lily.\nThe facility Jovine sent Lily to after a 10-month search is enrolled in the EXCELS program but is not yet rated.\nAsked if she referred to the EXCELS system during her search, Jovine said she didn’t even know about the state rating system at the time.\nJovine has seen her daughter develop significantly at the day care. Lily is happy to go and a little reluctant to leave in the evenings, Jovine said.\n“This is how I know she’s in good hands. She likes it there,” she said.\nA scholarship program\nIn addition to offering ratings of the state’s child care providers, Maryland expanded its child care scholarship program in 2022, making it easier to afford child care, said Heather Harding, coordinator at the Federalsburg Judy Center in Caroline County. \nBut providers said the scholarship program doesn’t work as well in practice as it does in theory.\nThe eligibility requirements for the scholarship program allow middle class families to apply. Any family of two making less than $61,222 per year is eligible; for a family of four, the limit is $104,438. \nA new fast-track program, launched on July 1, 2023, aims to reduce the wait time for parents to receive approval for a scholarship. Three days after applying, eligible families can get 60 days of child care paid for while their long-term aid application is processed. Scholarship values each year can range from $9,000 to $25,000 per child.\nLent, of the Maryland Family Network, said the new fast-track has vastly improved the scholarship program. Previously, parents would be placed on a waiting list to receive help with their child care expenses, he said. \nBut other requirements can make the system a catch-22, Harding said. Parents are required to be enrolled in school or working to be eligible for the scholarship, she said. But many of them can’t do either unless they have child care guaranteed.\n“Even if they find it, then they can’t pay for it till they get the scholarship,” Harding said.\nThese scholarships can only be used in facilities that are enrolled in the EXCELS program. After parents receive a voucher from the state, they present it to the provider. The provider then has to send paperwork to the state in order to be paid.\nGarey, the child care provider from Dundalk, said this is one of the most frustrating parts about the process. Multiple times, she filed paperwork and had to wait three months to be paid. At one point, the state owed her $15,000 in scholarship pay. This happened after the state moved to an advance-payment system that was supposed to provide providers with income more quickly.\n“It’s this delay after delay after delay,” Garey said.\nShe finds ways to deal with the months-late payments because she refuses to make the parents pay or to drop families from her list of clients.\n“One little girl is nonverbal. She sang and pointed to every single letter of the alphabet,” Garey said. “I did that. So why in the world would I drop that family?”\nOther providers also complain about late scholarship payments. Christine Morris, the director of Trinity Lutheran Christian School and Early Learning Center in Joppa, in Harford County, said this spring that the state owed her $40,000 in scholarship payments. And Shantel Rouzer, who runs Happy Feet Enrichment Childcare Center in Baltimore City, said she turned away students on the scholarship program because she knows the state’s reimbursements will come so late.\n“It’s not the families’ fault, but (Maryland State Department of Education officials) don’t hear us!!!?? And providers are tired!!!” Rouzer wrote in response to a survey from the Local News Network.\nSolving her own problem\nParents like Jovine don’t always know about the scholarship program. When she found out about the program in February, months after Lily, her youngest daughter, started day care, Jovine applied. A day later, the program’s new fast-track program started temporarily covering her child care costs for two months.\n“It took a huge load, And it’s amazing to have that option,” she said.\nBefore that, Jovine was paying $1,360 per month for child care for Lily. On top of that, she had to provide snacks, milk, lunch and other resources to the center.\nBut four days before Jovine’s temporary aid expired, she hadn’t gotten a final decision from the state. Jovine didn’t receive a response until June. By then, she was already paying out of pocket.  \nShe’ll have to continue to do so because the state decided she was earning too much money to qualify. Noting her application listed extra money from her old job at D.C. Public Schools that doesn’t reflect what she’s making now, she has reapplied.\nJovine and her longtime partner, Abdul Dopson, now need child care more than ever. Their third child, Mia, was born on June 14. \nKnowing infant spots are difficult to find, Jovine decided to leave her teaching job — and do her own small part to alleviate Maryland’s child care shortage. \n“I got licensed to start a day care myself: a home day care,” she said. “The need is that prevalent, you know, I might as well try to open up a day care myself and see what happens.”\nJovine’s fledgling child care facility, Elite Kidz Clubhouse, opens in August — but it’s already overtaken her home’s living room and dining room. She’s spent more than $2,500 on cots, desks, developmentally appropriate toys and other necessities.\nA large, colorful tree painted on the wall of the facility showcases the skills Jovine wants her students to get out of their day-to-day activities. Jovine said she wants her facility to work its way through the EXCELS system and eventually qualify as a preschool under the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s education reform plan.\n“Why not start this beautiful generation how it should, educating them and giving them what they need to be successful little children?” she said.\nLocal News Network reporter Laura Shaughnessy contributed to this report.",

    "content": "Halfway through her 12-week maternity leave last summer, Sarah Haddaway didn’t expect the trouble that would accompany her search for child care.\nAfter unexpected rejections from one fully booked child care facility after another, the lifelong resident of Maryland’s western panhandle began calling every provider she could find.\nAlmost 11 months later, Haddaway’s son Brooks — who just turned 1 — is on at least seven providers’ waitlists. He’s been on those waitlists since the end of July 2023.\n“It’s a nightmare,” said Haddaway, who is from Frostburg, in Allegany County. “There is no opening anywhere you look. It’s like winning the lottery.”\nParents across Maryland and the nation face the same struggle for one simple reason: the number of children who need child care exceeds the number of slots available in child care facilities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse. Maryland lost 15% of its child care providers and nearly 7% of its child care slots from Jan. 1, 2020, through Jan. 1, 2024, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. Those stats show that the number of child care slots in Maryland fell by 15,152 in those four years.\n\nSome Maryland counties experienced especially dramatic changes. St. Mary’s County, in Southern Maryland,  lost more than a quarter of its providers. Caroline County, on the Eastern Shore, lost nearly a quarter of its child care slots.\nIn other words, in many parts of Maryland and the nation, child care has gone missing. In this project, the Local News Network details how and why it happened and what can be done about it. Included is a county-by-county-look at child care trends, which readers can access here.\nIt’s not just Maryland families who struggle to find child care. A national survey of 2,000 Americans conducted in November 2023 for Care.com, a company that tries to match families with caregivers, found 65% of families with young children had spent time on child care waitlists.\nMany child care providers nationwide left the business amid the pressures of the pandemic, said Dr. Jay Belsky, a child psychologist and professor of human development at the University of California, Davis. He said that’s one reason why families struggle to find child care in a nation that, unlike many others, doesn’t offer consistent federal support for it.\n“What COVID showed us was how fragile the child care system was,” Belsky said. “We don’t have a child care system. We have a non-system.”\n‘Super, super difficult’\nChild care providers closed their doors in recent years for a variety of reasons tied to one central fact: their work is harder now. In a Local News Network survey of 256 current child care providers in Maryland, 62.5% said their jobs have become more difficult since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAsked to cite the challenges they face, 57.4% of child care providers listed financial stability, while 48% cited burdensome state regulations — issues that are connected, according to many providers. Meanwhile, 46.5% of the providers surveyed said they struggled to hire quality staff.\nChild care providers who left the business in recent years echoed those concerns.\nBen Stelle founded Kidpower at Silver Spring International in 2003 under a contract with Montgomery County that allowed him to work directly out of a school.\n“It’s super, super, super difficult to turn a profit if you don’t have the kind of sweetheart deal that I had,” Stelle said. “Unless you were getting subsidized and had your own sort of small monopoly on a school area, you were out of luck.” \nHe attributed this mostly to Maryland state regulations, which require that child care centers have one adult employee for every three children under the age of 2.   \n“You couldn’t turn a profit because you couldn’t stay affordable at the ratios that were being forced upon you,” Stelle said.\nRaven Hill, a spokeswoman for the Maryland State Department of Education — which oversees child care in the state — said there’s a good reason the state requires more staff to supervise the youngest children.\n“The 1:3 staff-to-child ratio for infants ensures that children receive high-quality care and activities,” Hill said. “Younger children typically need more care and attention, and smaller group sizes allow adults to interact more easily with each child and respond to their unique individual needs.”\nStelle decided to leave the child care business, ending his contract with the county before the end of the 2021 school year, for reasons other than state regulations. He said he was fatigued after decades of working with children.\n“The glamor of it wore off,” he said.\nCandace Hall, who operated a child care facility out of her home in Montgomery County, cited a different reason for why she closed her operation in 2021.\n“The last licensor specialist I had was extremely rude and demeaning,” Hall said in response to the Local News Network survey. “I decided after that last inspection, I would have to close down as I will not be disrespected in my own home.”\nMeanwhile, Maxine Seidman — who owned and operated Play Keepers Inc. out of a school in Randallstown for 40 years — said her income fell as the pandemic prompted parents to keep their children at home. Some of her staffers left, too. \n“Certainly none of us were making the kind of money we were making before, which wasn’t a whole heck of a lot before,” Seidman said. “But this made it very difficult to get staff after COVID.” \nThe struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic was unlike anything she had experienced.\n“It was very distressing,” she said.\nSeidman decided to retire in 2021. But now she’s concerned about the availability of child care in Baltimore County, which state statistics show lost 1,821 child care slots between the start of 2020 and the start of 2024.\n“I worry about some of the families,” Seidman said. “Who is taking care of their children? I wonder where those children are.”\nA frustrating search\nMany Maryland parents also wonder where the child care providers are.\nNoor Shakeel said she knew finding child care in Montgomery County would be a struggle.\n“I was always stressed out, hearing from my friends’ experiences,” said Shakeel, who lives in Germantown.\nTo alleviate that stress, Shakeel’s parents cared for her son until he was 18 months old. At that point, she could tell he wanted and needed more socialization.\nShakeel and her husband tried to keep an open mind when they started touring child care centers, but she came across obstacles.\n“Distance, safety and money,” Shakeel said. “Those are the three big factors.”\nThe process is also long, she said.\n“It comes to a point when you don’t have a choice other than to settle,” she said. \nEventually, Shakeel’s mother-in-law connected them to a family friend who happened to have an opening in her in-home day care. \n“We just got lucky,” Shakeel said.\nOther parents are not as fortunate.\nMasha Mukhina, an assistant professor of physics at the University of Maryland, moved to Prince George’s County in 2023. Colleagues advised her to add her son, who is now almost 2 years old, to the waitlist for Bright Horizons, a child care center in College Park affiliated with the university. \nMuch to her surprise, her son continues to be on the waitlist and has even dropped down a few spots due to aging out of the infant group into the toddler group.\n“Children move from this waiting list in and out based on age, and I’m supposed to be on the priority list as an employee of the university,” said Mukhina, who ended up hiring a nanny to care for her son. “And I don’t think it gets me any priority because everyone, more or less, on that waiting list is in the same position.”\nSeveral child care providers said availability is especially tight for families seeking care for children under the age of 2.\n“Because of the regulations and because of the guidelines that surround children under the age of 2, many of the providers and centers are no longer taking infants, which is making it harder to find infant care or child care for children under 2 throughout the state of Maryland, not just Baltimore,” said Brenda Velez-Jimenez, who operates Brenda’s Little Monkey Daycare in Catonsville, in Baltimore County.\nA continuing struggle\nAs difficult as it is for families to find quality child care now, some providers across Maryland fear the situation will get worse before it gets better.\nFor one thing, the federal government offered temporary aid totaling about $24 billion to prop up the child care industry during the pandemic. That program expired in September 2023.\nOn top of that, several providers noted they face new competition from unlicensed providers that popped up during the pandemic and operate without the same costly restrictions imposed by state regulations.\n“You’ve got other children’s neighbors that are providing unlicensed care,” Velez-Jimenez said.\nVelez-Jimenez criticized the state for not doing anything about those unlicensed providers, but Hill, the Maryland State Department of Education spokeswoman, begged to differ. \n“The Office of Child Care investigates all illegal child care complaints within 10 days of receipt,” she said.  “A cease-and-desist letter is issued to providers informing them that they must stop providing child care if they are doing so.”\nOther child care providers expressed fears about another new competitor: the new state pre-K program for 3- and 4-year-olds to be implemented over the next few years under the state’s education reform plan, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. \nWhile private child care providers are being counted on to join the pre-K program, some worry they will lose clients — and income — once the state starts offering free pre-K to 3- and 4-year-olds.\n“We are terrified that if we lose our 3- and 4-year-olds, you’re going to see centers closing down right and left because there won’t be enough income to support the teachers who work there,”  said Flora Gee, pedagogical administrator at the Greenbelt Children’s Center in Prince George’s County.\nGee said her facility has already been losing teachers to public schools that pay twice as much, and she isn’t the only child care provider who worries about staff shortages.\n“Finding and retaining competent employees who align with my day care facility’s values and standards is a constant challenge,” said Yvette Gordon, who runs a family child care facility in Baltimore City.\nKelli Deist, who runs an in-home day care in Frostburg, in Allegany County, said there’s an obvious reason for child care staffing shortages.\n“We don’t get paid what we deserve,” she said.\nDuring the pandemic, the state permitted Deist to take in children of essential workers in exchange for state compensation. \n“Financially, it was a struggle because we weren’t allowed to charge the parents,” she said. “The state was supposed to be paying us, but because it was such a big, new thing, they were way behind. I went three months without any payment at all.”\nA nationwide problem\nMaryland’s child care shortage is part of a nationwide phenomenon. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as many as 100,000 Americans have been forced to stay home from work because of their struggles to find child care. \n“This burden falls disproportionately on women of color who are on the frontlines of many essential jobs,” said Tina Kauh, a senior program officer and child care expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “Many are also child care providers who face the monumental feat of juggling their low-wage, high-risk jobs with caring for their families and themselves in the midst of a pandemic.” \nWith child care slots in such high demand, parents end up paying more and more. Care.com in 2023 found families responding to its survey spent 24% of their income on child care — even though the federal government considers child care affordable if it takes up 7% or less of a family’s income.\nFamilies spent an average of $321 a week on day care, up 13% from $284 in 2022, and many families are going into debt to pay child care bills.\n“Within the first five years of their child’s life, parents are being forced into a financial hole that is nearly impossible to climb out of,” Care.com CEO Brad Wilson said in a statement announcing the study’s findings. \nThe United States is unusual among developed nations in that it has no universal support system for child care or standardized policy on parental leave. Maryland offers a scholarship program that helps subsidize the cost of child care for lower-income families, but it does not cover the full cost.\nBelsky, of the University of California, Davis, said he believes there should be a system in place that gives parents a choice to stay home to raise their children if they want, or to be able to choose a high-quality care facility.\n“Giving families with young children more support, including economic support, might afford them the ability to more freely choose what they feel is best for their young children’s care,” Belsky said.\nBut for families where both parents work, stable child care is a necessity, Belsky said.\n“Especially at younger ages, stability of care is preferable, desirable, if only from the standpoint of quality of life,” he said.\nThat stability is important for kids and parents alike, according to Natasha Cabrera, a University of Maryland expert on human development.\n“The first five years of life [and] the first year of life is critically important for brain development,” said Cabrera, a professor at UMD’s College of Education. “Children are like sponges. Their brains are ready, and they’re wired to learn, but they need the cognitive stimulation from the environment.”\nThe child care shortage could have negative consequences for children across Maryland, such as decreased trust, lowered academic success or increased risk for developing a mental illness, she said.\n“It’s awful,” Cabrera said. “It’s very scary. If you care about the future of Maryland, you need to invest in its children.” \nLocal News Network reporters Fiona Flowers and Jess Daninhirsch contributed to this report.",

That’s a 15.12% decrease — the fourth largest in the state.\nHere's what Bridgette Lawrence, a licenced home child care provider in California, MD -- in St. Mary's County -- had to say about the child care situation there:\n\"I believe that the number of home-based child care providers...has dropped significantly for two main reasons since 2020. The first reason was the onset of the COVID pandemic, when, just like people from all walks of life and types of employment, child care workers were fearful for their safety and health, and that of their familles. They opted to take a break from providing care, retired completely from the field,\\ or switched to another career opportunity. Financial stability was tenuous for so many during this time and they had to support their families in whatever way possible. The decline in the number of available providers over that period hasn’t yet rebounded to the pre-pandemic numbers and therefore there is a gap between the number of child care spaces needed and the number of spaces available to meet those needs. The second reason for the lack of available child care, in my opinion, has to do with the increased expectations of providers from state-level agencies without the continued, appropriate support to meet these expectations. These state level agencies want to increase the standards for care, but continually do away with the support systems that are designed to assist providers in reaching those raised standards.\"\n-- Jenna Bloom and Jerry Zremski",

Children are different today, they are raised in a media world where family time isn't important and they don't have to respect elders. Parents have no respect for providers. Providers don't want to be educators: they would like for child care to go back under human resources and we were only responsible for preparing children socially for school. State scholarships have broken many providers waiting on pay that they seeked out other means of income. Schools are taking our toddlers only leaving us with 2 and unders: we can't compete with free care.

    "content": "SALY, Senegal – A large bubble surrounds two full sized basketball courts in the heart of this beach town just over 50 miles from the country’s capital in Dakar.\nIn the morning and in the evenings approximately 20 young men ages 15-19 years old, train on the courts which feature the National Basketball Association (NBA) logo. These are 20 of the most promising young basketball players on the continent of Africa.\nWhile their days start and end with basketball, what happens in between is just as transformative.\nAcademics are taken seriously here. Students work on classes up to five hours each day. They bring culture and languages from countries throughout Africa.\nMichael Abbott, Head of Educational Programming at the NBA Academy Africa, said that from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm, the young men focus on academics, break for lunch, then return to the classroom at 2:30 pm for another two hours of education before training on the basketball court again to end their day.\nEnglish proficiency is a key for players who hope to attend college in the United States and play in the NBA. Language training is provided through Apex Learning, an English-based online learning platform that is the basis for the education in the academy. This is the same learning platform that is used by many high schools in the United States.\nManuel Barreto Francisco Camboma, 18, of Angola is currently in three classes – English, math, and French – though his favorite class at the academy has been Spanish. “I’m trying to get the accent, ” he said with a smile.\nWhile core courses like math, history, and English are prioritized, the educational staff aims to provide a quality education that focuses life after the academy.\nThe academy aims to equip each student with knowledge they may need if they choose to attend university or play professional basketball in the United States. Discussions around slavery in the United States context come up in U.S. history courses. Abbott said this conversation is particularly important, noting that having the chance to prepare academy players, most of whom are Black, for the racial contexts and dynamics they will experience in the United States is crucial.\nUnderstanding cultural differences also is important for navigating life at the academy. Abbott describes that “race, identity, culture, nationality, all these things come in [to student learning] and it gets very challenging to navigate.”\n“Over here, you have people that are from all around Africa, that speak three different languages,” said Adjaratou Nafissatou “Nafi” Mamour Niang, an IT specialist and tutor at the academy. She added that “being able to interact with each of them really makes it very special.”\nMamour Niang noted that one of the most important lessons instilled in students:  “Life is not just all about basketball — yes it’s very important, but there are so many other things that you can be”\nAbbott had a similar message.\n“You’re not going to bounce a ball your whole life – there’s going to be a point where you can’t shoot anymore… but you always have the ability and capacity to think.”",

    "content": "Maryland plans to spend $16.6 billion through 2029, along with billions more after that, to improve its public schools. \nBut will it work? \nState legislators created a seven-member oversight board to ensure it would. \nThe Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a transformative education law passed in 2021, aims to boost student performance and education quality throughout Maryland schools. It outlines these goals in five pillars: the expansion of prekindergarten, the hiring and retention of high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, additional resources, and accountability and governance.\nLawmakers established the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board to monitor the Blueprint’s progress. The board oversees funding and initiative implementation while providing guidance to school districts, all with the intention of improving academic performance in Maryland.\n“I think part of it is just understanding that we can do better, we need to do better and we’re going to do better,” said Rachel Hise, executive director of the accountability board. “That’s the promise of the Blueprint.”\nSchool leaders across the state tend to agree — but they said the Blueprint comes with complications that go beyond the financial challenges it poses to the state and its 24 public school districts. Educators said they’re concerned about the Blueprint’s deadlines, a lack of detailed procedural information and the plan’s overall place in the educational system.\n“Implementing a law as comprehensive as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is going to be a herculean effort under the best of circumstances,” Baltimore City Public Schools officials wrote in their May 1 report to the accountability board. “But combined with the added complexities of pandemic recovery, delays that resulted in extremely limited pre-implementation planning time for districts, and the slow pace of regulations and guidance pertaining to the Blueprint, the challenges are amplified.”\nAssessing the Blueprint\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board will oversee the progress of each public school system in implementing Blueprint initiatives.\nThe board is by law required to: \n\nDevelop a plan to fully implement the Blueprint in public school systems, complete with timelines and deadlines.\nMonitor the progress school districts and the state are making regarding the Blueprint by reporting annually on 92 data measures, which collect information on student performance, teacher preparation and outcomes backed by Blueprint funding. \nDetermine if changes need to be made to the plan to achieve the plan’s original goals.\nEnsure “Expert Review Teams” of teachers, faculty and staff observe schools and understand how to make recommendations about changing how the plan is implemented. \nRelease about a quarter of Blueprint funds each year to school systems that are implementing initiatives properly.\nHire an independent contractor to evaluate the Blueprint’s success.\nEnsure school systems demonstrate at least 75% of funding received per student follows the students to their school.\n\nUnder the law, the accountability board can withhold funding from school systems that fail to implement Blueprint initiatives or show significant student progress.\nThe board holds routine meetings to hear from Marylanders. It also has a series of advisory groups to gather feedback from teachers, parents, students and other stakeholders, according to Laura Stapleton, a board member and chair of the University of Maryland’s Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.\n“There’s so many moving parts,” Stapleton said. “Many different stakeholders are needed to implement all the various parts of the Blueprint.”\nStretching deadlines\nEvery Maryland public school district is responsible for rolling out Blueprint initiatives and collecting each of the 92 different data measures for the Accountability and Implementation Board to evaluate, Stapleton said.\nBut school district officials said none of that is easy.\n“With educational reform of this scale, it is difficult to keep up with the constant changes, timelines and work of each pillar,” Carroll County school district leaders said in their May 1 submission to the accountability board.\nJanine Bacquie, Montgomery County Public Schools’ Blueprint implementation coordinator, said her district is straining to properly gather data and implement Blueprint initiatives within allocated deadlines. \n“We’re struggling to get the guidance that we need to do the work that we need to do with a short timeline,” Bacquie said. “If we had another year or two, it’d certainly take some of the pressure off.”\nAll 24 school districts were originally required to submit their final Blueprint implementation plans by March 2024. \nBut because the state provided necessary materials — such as report templates and expectations — to districts only two months before the March deadline, the submission schedule was revised.\nThe March deadline was changed so it only had to be a 10-page preliminary report, according to Bacquie. The final report deadline was then pushed back to May 1.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board is facing a tough deadline, too. According to Stapleton, an independent contractor is set to perform an evaluation of the Blueprint by October. \nBut Stapleton said she hopes the deadline for the evaluation can be pushed back a few years to give the Blueprint’s many initiatives more time to lead to change.\nA slow flow of information\nMeanwhile, Blueprint information seems to move slowly to and through the state’s school districts.\n“Because the implementation of Blueprint is massive and encompasses the entire district, one of the biggest challenges is communicating with employees the ways in which their work already aligns with the Blueprint,” Prince George’s County school officials said in their March 2024 submission to the accountability board.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board holds regular meetings on Zoom for anyone to attend. All meetings are held online and published in an online archive for anyone to view.\nBut Javier Valera, a math content specialist at a public middle school in Montgomery County, said he and other teachers have no clue about the depth of information in the Blueprint. \nHe said the state should work harder to keep teachers informed. \nChanges are coming next year, “and we don’t even know anything about it,” Valera said. “It is concerning, because we are going to be the ones implementing the plan. … There should be more transparency and they need to talk with us and let us know what is this about.”\nSparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George’s County, echoed Valera’s sentiments about a need for more details about the Blueprint. \n“There’s a lot of information that definitely needs to be clarified,” Jefferson said. “I think it needs to be disseminated in a clear, concise manner where of course our principals are able to understand — and understand the impact that it has for each school.”\nMembers of the accountability board encourage community members to provide feedback. Principals, parents and teachers are urged to reach out about the Blueprint, Rachel Amstutz, the accountability board’s policy director, said at a principals conference late last year.\n“We need to hear from the local level what’s happening and what you need,” Amstutz said. “We need to hear from our parents what’s working for their kids and what isn’t.”\nLingering concerns\nImplementing the Blueprint hasn’t gone exactly as planned so far. Deadlines for criteria and implementation plans have been extended at least three times. And in district-level Blueprint plans submitted this spring, school officials across the state expressed a variety of concerns.\n“From funding uncertainties to staffing shortages and delays in receiving critical guidance, the district must navigate various obstacles to ensure the successful execution of Blueprint initiatives,” Caroline County school officials said in their March submission to the accountability board.\nMeanwhile, school officials in Allegany County said workforce issues make implementing the Blueprint a challenge. “Sustaining district-level initiatives across all schools is difficult because of staff retirements and turnover rates,” officials wrote in their May 1 report.\nIn their Blueprint update, St. Mary’s County school officials said they are concerned about all the elements of public education the Blueprint ignores. Other crucial parts of the learning experience could see funding cuts as the district strives to meet the Blueprint’s mandates, they said.\n“The ubiquitous challenge inherent in meeting Blueprint goals is in the fact that the Blueprint is silent on supporting all else, i.e., the arts, athletics, enrichment and after-school programming, transportation, facilities, health care, etc.,” St. Mary’s County school officials wrote. “These elements of school are necessary and imperative in supporting the whole child.”\nAmid all the concerns, Bacquie, Montgomery County’s Blueprint coordinator, said further delays may be necessary. The rush to complete various measures in the Blueprint could render the plan to reinvent Maryland’s public schools less effective than it could otherwise be, she said.\n“It’s not something where you just come in and say something’s going to change overnight,” Bacquie said. “You’re changing hearts, thoughts, minds, strategies.” \nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "content": "The results for Maryland’s 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) for grades four and eight reflected a national declining trend that began in 2013 and worsened during the pandemic.\nThe NAEP is a biennial national assessment of fourth and eighth graders in reading and math, and 2022 results indicated that a majority of Maryland fourth and eighth grade students were not proficient in mathematics or reading.\n“When you look at trends, not necessarily where they rank in 2022, but just looking at how performance has changed from 2013 to 2022, Maryland seems to be heading in the wrong direction,” said Grady Wilburn, a statistician at the National Center for Education Statistics.\n2022 reading scores down both nationally and in Maryland:\nIn 2022, the average reading score of fourth-grade students in the nation was 216, while Maryland had an average score of 212. The average score for Maryland dropped eight points between 2019 and 2022, while national scores dropped three points.\nIn Maryland, fourth-grade Hispanic students’ average reading scores showed the largest decline from 2019 to 2022, dropping 7%. Those who identify as two or more races showed the next largest at 4%, and Black students’ average reading scores saw an almost 2% decline.\nNationally, the average fourth-grade reading scores showed a 2.5% decline in scores for Black students and an almost 2% decline in scores for Hispanic students from 2019 to 2022.\n“Because of COVID-19, we saw declines across most states in all grades and subjects, so I think it’s fair to attribute part of the decline from 2019 to 2022 to school closures and disruptions in schools,” said Wilburn.\n\nThe average reading scores for fourth-grade students in Maryland that are eligible for the National School Lunch Program declined almost 5%, while students not eligible showed an almost 3% decline in scores from 2019 to 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the average reading score of eighth-grade students in Maryland was 259, the same average score for students nationally. Maryland’s eighth-grade average scores dropped almost 2% between 2019 and 2022.\nIn Maryland, eighth-grade students who identify as two or more races showed the largest drop in average scores for reading with an almost 6% decline. Black students’ scores dropped by almost 3%, Asian/Pacific Islander students’ scores dropped almost 2%, and white and Hispanic students’ scores dropped less than 1% from 2019 to 2022.\n\nNationally, average eighth-grade scores for white students dropped by 1.5%, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander students’ scores did not change, and scores for Hispanic students and those who identify as two or more races dropped by less than 1%.\n“Regardless of socioeconomic status, everyone seems to be declining,” Wilburn said.\nMathematics scores also declining:\nThe average mathematics score for fourth-grade students in Maryland in 2019 was 239 and dropped to 229 in 2022, almost 3% lower than average national scores\nFrom 2019 to 2022 in Maryland, Hispanic students showed the largest drop in average fourth-grade mathematics scores with an almost 8% decline, Black students’ scores declined almost 5%, Asian/Pacific Islander students’ scores declined just over 3%, and white students’ scores declined by just over 1%.\nThe only group to see an increase in scores was students who identify as two or more races, with scores increasing by 1.6%.\n\nNationally, scores for all racial and ethnic groups declined, with Black students showing the largest decline at just over 3%.\nThe average mathematics scores for fourth-grade students in Maryland that are eligible for the National School Lunch Program declined by just over 6%, and ineligible students’ scores declined by just over 3% from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe average mathematics score of eighth-grade students in Maryland dropped from 280 in 2019 to 269 in 2022, and the average mathematics score for students in the nation was 273.\nIn Maryland, both Black and Hispanic eighth-grade students’ scores dropped the most, declining just over 4%.\n\nNationally, average mathematics scores for eighth-grade students who identify as two or more races declined the most, dropping by 3.5% from 2019 to 2022, and Black and Hispanic students’ scores dropped by just over 2.5%.\nWhile scores have been declining since 2013, the pandemic was a “wakeup call that the education system is struggling,” according to Wilburn.\nIn order to understand where these gaps in learning are coming from, Wilburn says that “allowing an opportunity for someone who is good at tutoring, who knows what they’re doing, to help understand where the holes are, and then fill in those holes with some high dosage tutoring,” is a key strategy in helping struggling students.\nIn a 2022 Maryland State Department of Education press release, State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said “there is no sugar coating these results. Maryland has been experiencing a downward trend since 2013, and a return to normal is not good enough.”\nThe next NAEP tests will be administered in the winter of 2024 in Maryland, with results estimated to come out in the summer of 2025.",

    "content": "Sunisa Lee made history in 2021 when she clinched the top spot in the women’s gymnastics individual all-around at the Tokyo Olympics. Along with being the first woman of Asian descent to win the Olympic all-around title, she became the fifth consecutive American to take the coveted spot at the summer games. \nShe’s also the first Olympic all-around gold medalist to compete in NCAA gymnastics, and could earn money through sponsorships and deals in addition to doing college gymnastics.\nIt’s a path that’s now possible after a 2021 Supreme Court decision causing an NCAA rule change to allow athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness, or NIL. \nIn past years, elite gymnasts decided at a young age whether they wanted to pursue the professional route of earning money via sponsorships or maintaining their amateur status for opportunities to receive college athletic scholarships. NCAA rules prohibited professional athletes, so gymnasts couldn’t compete in college if they received money from sponsorships.\nBut now athletes don’t have to choose. The rule change means gymnasts like Lee can profit off their success without forfeiting their NCAA eligibility, competing in college while also earning money from deals and sponsorships.\n“I’m so fortunate to be able to compete at the collegiate level and pursue my business at the same time,” Lee told Forbes in 2022. “It’s huge for athletes who don’t have pro leagues to go on to after college.”\nThe gymnasts representing the U.S. in Tokyo had proportionally more athletes who competed in college than at any other Olympics.\n\n1984 marked the first time the summer games were held since the NCAA introduced women’s gymnastics as a champion sport in 1982.\nSince then, 63 unique athletes have competed in the sport’s biggest stage at the Olympics — excluding alternates — and at the collegiate level. These gymnasts retained their amateur status and couldn’t earn money for their Olympic success. \nThe bulk of these competitors represented North American countries: 23 for the United States and 19 for Canada. \n\nTwo Olympic gymnasts competed at the collegiate level for another sport. Amy Chow took on diving at Stanford beginning in 2008 and Phoebe Mills did the same at Miami starting in 1991.\nUCLA’s women’s gymnastics team has the most Olympians by a landslide.\nThe Bruins boast 17 Olympians, eight of whom represented the U.S. It’s nearly twice as many as second-place Stanford, which has nine Olympians — all of whom were international. \nUCLA has had an athlete who’s competed at nine of the 10 Olympic Games since women’s gymnastics became an NCAA sport.\nThe list includes Kyla Ross and Madison Kocian, who in 2017 became the first Olympic gold medalists to compete at the NCAA level. \n“I just feel like they enrich the program so much,” then-head coach Valerie Kondos Field told ESPN in 2017. “Regardless of what we’re scoring or not scoring, their commitment to the team, their excitement, their enthusiasm for anything we do… they just have bought in 100 percent.”\n\nLee is vying for one of five spots on the 2024 Olympic team.\nSo is Leanne Wong, a junior at Florida and an alternate in Tokyo. She’s one of three athletes who elected to compete in college this season while also training to represent the U.S. in Paris. It’s her coaches at Florida who travel with her to national team camps, elite meets and international competitions. \nOn top of gymnastics, she balances her classes, business — she’s the founder and CEO of Leanne Wong Bowtique, a bow and leotard company — and NIL deals. \n“I really just have to take it day by day and plan out each day, what needs to get done first, and time management,” Wong told Capital News Service.\nAs of January, 13 contenders for the 2024 U.S. Olympic team have ties to college gymnastics, according to the NCAA. Of these, seven have already competed at the collegiate level, while the other six haven’t entered college but are committed to schools. \nThe country’s strongest prospects face off at the Olympic Team Trials in June. After two days of competition in Minneapolis, USA Gymnastics will determine who heads to Paris.",

    "content": "﻿﻿\nYou might think spending $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 through 2029 — and billions more after that — would be enough to give Maryland a world-class education system. But that’s not what many people at the state’s local school districts think.\nFor proof, look at what local district leaders said in March when they updated state officials on efforts to implement the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s landmark effort to rebuild its public schools.\n“The funding provided under the Blueprint is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements,” officials in the Baltimore City Public School System wrote.\n“Blueprint funding tied to specific programs for expansion requires the elimination of other programs and supports,” the St. Mary’s County Public School System’s report said.\nMeanwhile, in Kent County, school officials bemoaned that the district will see increased costs related to staffing, data systems, student support and transportation. “KCPS has found that many of the requirements of the Blueprint come without subsequent funding sources to sufficiently cover full implementation,” district officials wrote.\nCreated by legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint is built on five pillars: expanding pre-K to all 4-year-olds and low-income 3-year-olds, improving the teacher workforce, changing curriculums statewide to prepare students for college and careers, expanding funding and setting up a state agency to oversee it all.\nBut in those March updates, 15 of the state’s 24 school districts listed funding or resource allocations among the three central challenges they face under the Blueprint. \nMeanwhile, some county officials — such as Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly — say the Blueprint is unaffordable.\n“Unrealistic state spending mandates for the Blueprint for Education are straining local budgets statewide and should be paused and revisited,” Cassilly said as he unveiled the county’s latest budget April 15. \nNew mandates\nWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint also asks local school districts — and taxpayers — to do their part. And that is causing some concern among the state’s school principals, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals. \n“In education, one thing that sometimes happens is we get unfunded mandates, and unfunded mandates are very challenging,” Kaufman said at a principals conference late last year.\nCounty leaders find the mandates challenging, too. In a letter to Gov. Wes Moore — a Democrat and strong supporter of the Blueprint — the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint’s cost estimates don’t take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including:\n\nConstruction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan’s expansion of pre-K.\nClassroom modifications to accommodate instructional changes called for under the Blueprint plan to expand career and technical education.\nAdditional staffing for special education students and English language learners.\nThe new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026 and other efforts to construct a “career ladder” for Maryland teachers.\n\nNoting that local education funding has already reached all-time highs, the Maryland Association of Counties said: “This record county funding, combined with greater funding requirements mandated by the law, will limit counties’ ability to fund competing governmental needs at basic operational levels.”\nThe Blueprint’s burden on local school districts is only beginning to be felt. By 2034, local school districts will be expected to pay $700 million more annually than they would if the Blueprint hadn’t been adopted, a 2022 state report projected.\n“As the Blueprint ramps up and the formulas increase, more and more counties will have to put more funds in because the local share will increase,” said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, the statewide agency created to oversee the Blueprint. “We’re just in the early first couple of years of Blueprint implementation. So it’s only four or five counties that are required to put in more than they have been. But over time, it will be more than half of them.”\nTrouble in the counties\nTo hear county officials tell it, though, the Blueprint’s mandates are already leaving them in a pinch.\nWhen the Blueprint began its rollout, Dorchester County saw a $3 million jump in local funding contributions, according to County Council President Lenny Pfeffer.\n“That $3 million jump was devastating to us,” Pfeffer said. “We had to pull from every resource and cut some programs that we wanted to do as far as highway maintenance, bridge maintenance and other things like that.” \nMeanwhile in Cecil County, a school funding battle tied in part to the Blueprint led to the creation of a Facebook group — Fund CCPS — with 6,700 members.\nCecil County Executive Danielle Hornberger, a Republican, has refused to meet the school district’s funding request. And last month, Hornberger filed an ethics complaint against Cecil County Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson, accusing him of using public property and funds for political purposes in the budget battle.\n“CCPS families deserve better,” Hornberger said.\nThat prompted an angry response from Allison Stoudt, the Rising Sun High School senior who founded the Fund CCPS Facebook group. Noting that the county has funded local schools “at the legal minimum” for three years running and that its current budget proposal falls $13 million short of the $17 million in additional local aid the district is seeking, Stoudt called Hornberger’s accusation against Lawson “shameful.”\nIn Worcester County, the county government has similarly refused to increase school funding above the state requirement minimums, leading to a $9 million cash shortfall that could force the district to trim between 90 and 100 staff positions.\n“It is WCPS’ belief that drastically cutting instructional staff runs contrary to the spirit of the Blueprint’s goals of continual improvement and transformation in education,” district officials said in their March Blueprint update.\nShifting resources\nThe Blueprint also calls for shifting resources within school districts at the expense of other schools.\nCarroll County Public Schools Superintendent Cynthia McCabe explained the potential ramifications of that change at a public meeting in Sykesville last year.\n“What I don’t want to be is a fearmonger, but I also don’t want to get to September of 2024 and have parents calling me saying, ‘Why are the class sizes so much bigger in my child’s school this year?’” McCabe said during the presentation. \nThe Blueprint shifts funding to higher-need schools in several ways. \nThe education reform plan provides “concentration of poverty” grants to some schools to bolster support for academics, extracurriculars, and mental and physical health. Grants are given to schools based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price meals. In this fiscal year, 454 schools in Maryland received concentration of poverty grants, with just over one- fourth given to schools in Baltimore City. \n“Especially the community where I serve within my district, they’ve benefited greatly from having concentrations of poverty funding,” said Ashley Moore, principal at the Empowerment Academy, a charter school in Baltimore City. \nIn addition, a new requirement under the Blueprint requires students who qualify for Medicaid to automatically be enrolled in free and reduced-price school meals. \n“This is an improvement from the standpoint of feeding kids,” said Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy. \nBut shifting resources to the schools that need them leads to ramifications elsewhere.\nIn Baltimore County, for example, average class sizes will go from 25 to 24 in grades 1-3 starting in the fall,  but middle school class sizes will grow from 20 to 22 while high school class sizes will increase from 21 to 23.\nAt a February media briefing, Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said elementary school class sizes have been reduced under the Blueprint because making sure students can read by third grade “has been proven time and time again to be an indicator of success.” In addition, she noted that fifth-graders must pass state tests on reading and math.\nAsked if the larger class sizes in other grades could negatively impact students, Rogers replied: “No,” saying district officials were being careful in how they were planning to adjust class sizes.\nBut McCabe, the Carroll County superintendent, reiterated her concern about class-size adjustments called for under the Blueprint.\n“We are concerned that very large class sizes will be detrimental to student learning,” McCabe said in an email. “As we are seeing increased mental health concerns in our student population. It is essential that teachers have a manageable class size in order to meet the varied needs of students.”\nThe future\nThe Blueprint’s long rollout period — along with the nation’s post-pandemic bout with inflation — could pose other financial concerns to local school districts.\nMapping out the potential district-level impact of the Blueprint in 2022, the Maryland State Department of Legislative Services projected that 15 of the state’s 24 school districts would have to increase local funding levels at some point before the Blueprint rollout is complete in 2034.\n“The impacts are not uniform … leading several counties to need to make significant increases in their local appropriation to the boards of education in the early years, later years, or both,” the state report said. “Other county governments are forecast to spend about the same or slightly more than they would have otherwise.”\nOf course, inflation could impact those projections. Meyer, the research analyst with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, noted the Blueprint’s cost projections were made before prices skyrocketed at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Actual costs in the economy have gone way up, but the funding amounts that are required under state law haven’t,” Meyer said.\nThat being the case, it’s possible that some of the funding requirements in the Blueprint may be changed at some point, either by the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board or the General Assembly.\n“No law is ever perfect,” Maryland Education Coalition co-chair Rick Tyler Jr. said. “We’re still early in the process of what is intended to be a 10-year process.”\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "content": "Northern High School had never had a career counselor. Not until Christian Wargo walked through its doors.\nIn September, Wargo became the Calvert County high school’s first career advisor as a part of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a multi-billion dollar legislative plan to improve education across the state.\nNow, every school district across the state is hiring career counselors like Wargo to help students navigate a pressing question: What do they want to do when they grow up?\nWargo said his help is in high demand.\n“I’m in the classrooms a lot with the kids still introducing myself so they know who I am, but I’m starting to have a lot of students come to me on their own,” he said.\nA new emphasis on career counseling is just part of the Blueprint’s college and career readiness “pillar,” which starts with an ambitious goal: to make sure all high school students are prepared for their next steps after high school by the end of the 10th grade.\nMany students fall short of that goal now, and Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, said that leaves educators with an important lesson.\n“The bulk of kids need something different than what we’re doing for them now,” Hise said.\nThat “something different” is already taking shape amid the state’s education bureaucracy and at its 1,421 or so public schools. The State Department of Education is redesigning curriculums and has already revised how to measure college and career readiness. Districts are funneling more high school juniors and seniors to dual enrollment programs at local community colleges, and schools are placing a far stronger emphasis on career and technical education.\nA sweeping curriculum overhaul \nAll Blueprint changes need to be in place by the 2031-2032 school year. While each school district is tasked with developing its own implementation plan, one key to the Blueprint is a “model statewide curriculum” that’s currently under development.\n“We are trying to get rid of our gaps and to really understand what we need to do to meet our kids to make sure that they leave us prepared for college, career and life,” said Rachel Amstutz, policy director for the Accountability and Implementation Board that’s overseeing the Blueprint rollout.\nWhile it’s not yet clear what those changes might entail, the Blueprint Implementation Plan discusses possible adjustments to math, English language arts, science and social studies curriculums to align with local college admissions standards and research on student learning.\n“You’ll hear us talk about reimagining the school day,” Amstutz said. “We don’t envision high school looking like what high school has looked like since my parents were in school.”\nThe Blueprint also requires a universal standard to measure college and career readiness. The state had been using Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores, a state standardized test, as an indicator of success. By 10th grade, students need to meet expectations in English language arts and math to be deemed “career and college ready.”\nBut the test results from the 2020-21 school year, the latest available, showed just over half of students (53.5%) met the English language arts requirements and roughly 40% passed math standards by 10th grade. Maryland high schoolers have to take the test to graduate, but aren’t required by the state to pass. However, starting this year the government and life science tests will count for 20% of a student’s course grade.\nStudies commissioned by the Blueprint found that including an alternative to demonstrating college and career readiness through passing exams, such as earning a 3.0 GPA, was more inclusive than standardized tests alone and better predicted student success in college. \nThat being the case, the State Board of Education in January unanimously adopted a new set of college and career readiness standards last month that includes that GPA measure as an alternative to test scores.\nNow it’s up to teachers, career counselors and students to try to meet those standards.\n“The Blueprint is really asking us to rethink what high school looks like and really make sure that we’re preparing all of our students to go to college or enter the workforce in a way that we just haven’t done before,” said Sarah Bento, assistant principal at Northern High School in Calvert County.\nCollege Prep: AP Classes and Dual Enrollment\nThe requirement to add career counselors in every school means students will have more support to think about what they want to do. For many, that still means pursuing a college degree.\nOn average, roughly half of Maryland high school graduates go straight to college after high school.\nNorthern High School sophomore Simon Mackenzie Dean, 15, is one such student planning on going to college. He knew he liked math and science, and after speaking with Wargo, he decided to go either into nuclear engineering or quantum physics.\n“We had the resources to look at more job opportunities, what it does, how it works and sort of that stuff,” Dean said. “And it made me think more about it. Even just having the ability to do that [is helpful], so you can narrow it down more.”\nFor high school students interested in college, options such as AP classes or dual-enrollment at community colleges help them prepare for that next step and can defray the costs of earning a four-year degree.\nLast year, about one in 15 Maryland high schoolers participated in dual enrollment programs at local colleges.\nThe Blueprint requires local community colleges to accept 11th- and 12th- graders who meet college and career readiness standards and requirements for dual enrollment tuition-free.\nCareer counselors can also help students make informed decisions about where to go to school, what to study and how to pay for it, said Carrie Akins, director of Career and Technical Education at Calvert County Public Schools.\n“I think people have been hungry for that knowledge for quite some time, but as parents, what they knew was, ‘I don’t want my kid to have thousands of dollars in debt, but I don’t know what to tell them,’” Akins said. “So I think that they’re very excited to now have somebody that can help their child through that process.”\nAlternatives to a Four-Year Degree\nThe Blueprint also requires increasing career preparation opportunities for students who won’t end up going to college. The Blueprint aims to have 45% of high school graduates completing an apprenticeship or industry-recognized credential by the 2030-31 school year.\nThat’s a lofty goal. Current state data show that, as of February 2023, 27% of high school students had completed a career and technical education program. However, just 7% had earned an industry credential or completed an apprenticeship.\nHigh schools in Garrett, Somerset, Kent and Caroline counties currently have the highest participation rates in career and technical education, while Prince George’s and Montgomery counties have the lowest, State Department of Education data show.\nState-approved career and technical education programs include health professions, early childhood education, dental hygienist and dental assisting, culinary arts, carpentry, cosmetology, air traffic control and many other career training options.\nThe key to getting students to consider such careers involves reaching them young and debunking some old stereotypes, educators said.\n“We really should be starting a conversation of college and career at the K through eight level,” said Ryan Daniel, principal of Fort Foote Elementary School in Prince George’s County.\nSuch conversations can make a big difference. Northern High School freshman Cody Bach Du, 14, wanted to either go to college for landscaping architecture or go to the Calvert County Career and Technology Academy for woodworking or welding. Talking with Wargo made Duhim realize there were other pathways to sustainable careers outside of a four-year degree.\n“When Mr. Wargo came in and he told me about all of these different opportunities, it kind of opened my view up,” Du said. \nGiven the historical emphasis on a four-year college education, there can be a lingering stigma for students who want to enter the workforce out of high school or opt for job training instead.\n“We still need to make sure that we’re doing a better job, really, taking some of that stigma away,” said Chrystie Crawford-Smick, president of the Harford County Education Association, a bargaining union for local education employees. “They’re very lucrative careers and very needed.”\nNikki Phillips, the new advisor at Plum Point Middle School in Calvert County, said some students come to her with a set idea of what success looks like based on perceptions they learn from their parents.\nBecause older generations were taught that earning a four-year degree was the best path to success, part of the job now involves educating parents on today’s career landscape, especially with factors such as artificial intelligence and automation, Akins said.\nIt’s a slightly different conversation than the one Phillips has with younger students.\n“When we talk about anything in the future, they’re like, ‘I want to be rich,’” she said. \nInstead of getting her students to focus on how much money they will make, however, she said she tries to get them to focus on other things, like the quality of life with each job.\n“Are you willing to put in the effort to get there?” Phillips said. “Because, no matter what the job is, you still have to go through the effort to get there.”",

    "content": "Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\n“I feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work — to do work after work,” said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf, in Charles County.\nCarpenter’s long hours are far from unique among Maryland’s educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage. \nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database — and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as “areas of certification.” That’s up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas — such as English as a second language, health science and special education — are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland’s Future – a landmark state law reforming public education — aims to fix that problem by “elevating the stature of the teaching profession” through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n“Money is a huge help, but it’s not everything,” said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. “Human capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.”\nDocumenting the shortage\nMaryland’s teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n“You hear a lot about the teacher shortage — and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?” asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George’s County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 — up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n“I used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,” said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. “The pandemic told some people, you know what? If you’re not happy, move on.”\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year. \n “Our class sizes are growing, and we don’t have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,” she said.\n‘Teaching isn’t approved’\nSchools are suffering from a long-term decline in the number of people interested in becoming teachers.\nThat decline has been ongoing since the mid-‘70s, “but it gets worse and worse and worse, year over year,” said Mike Hansen, an education policy expert at the Brookings Institution.\nAccording to the State Department of Education, 9,134 people were enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state in 2012. That number plummeted by about half by 2017, but rose to 6,037 by 2020.\nWhy is teaching becoming less appealing as a career? Zid Mancenido, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has been studying that issue.\n“One of the major findings of my research has been that people are taught over time that teaching isn’t a great career,” he said in a 2022 interview on the school’s website. “There are all these tiny interactions they have over their lifetime that give them this feeling that teaching isn’t approved, that they should be aspiring to other careers that might be more prestigious or well-paid.”\nAmid the shortage, many schools hire less-credentialed “conditional” teachers — those who have not yet received their professional certifications. Maryland’s issuance of conditional certificates more than doubled between 2018 to 2022, a state Department of Education report said.\n\nIn Charles County, where Carpenter works, 12.4% of all teachers held conditional certificates by 2021  – a rate only surpassed by Baltimore City (13.4%) and Prince George’s County (14.3%).\nCarpenter said experienced teachers are leaned on to help the conditional hires.\n“Which would be fine if you had one or two teachers who needed that support. But we have a massive amount of teachers who are conditional right now,” she said.\nThe Blueprint’s pay bump\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don’t leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions – or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland’s teacher workforce.\n“If our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states … then candidates are more likely to come,” Larner explained.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state’s teacher shortage. \nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it’s needed the most – attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n“I think we need to be paying teachers more – I don’t think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,” he said.\nBoosting careers and diversity\nThe Blueprint also aims to improve teacher quality by encouraging educators to obtain additional training.\nThe plan provides for a salary increase of $10,000 for teachers who become National Board Certified, an advanced teaching credential that fewer than 6% of Maryland teachers held at the start of 2023, according to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Teachers in high-need areas may see their annual salaries increase by up to $17,000 by becoming certified.\n“We want to professionalize the career of teaching, and I think that is absolutely what we should be doing,” said Stephanie Novak Pappas, principal of the Holabird Academy, an elementary and middle school in Baltimore.\nHowever, Hansen questioned the Blueprint’s emphasis on National Board certification. \n“We don’t have a lot of evidence that actually getting your NBC makes you a better teacher,” Hansen said. \nThe Blueprint also calls on school districts to create a diverse workforce. The Accountability and Implementation Board – which oversees the Blueprint – will evaluate those efforts.\nA diverse workforce has significant benefits, according to David Blazar, an education policy expert at the University of Maryland.\nBlazar said that increasing the share of Black teachers has “exceptionally large impacts on students’ short and long term outcomes,” he said. “I’d say some of the largest impacts I’ve seen across all of the educational intervention literature.”\nBut maximizing the benefits of a more diverse workforce will be complicated, Blazar said. Even if the state’s teacher workforce came to match the demographics of its students, there would likely still be “clustering of Black teachers within certain districts, and within certain schools within districts,” he said.\nHansen echoed those concerns, and said that teachers nationwide remain even more racially segregated than students. Rather than aiming to make the teachers within individual districts reflect the exact racial demographics as their students, he suggested that policymakers should “maximize exposure and access to a diverse set of teachers for every student” across different regions.\nA work in progress\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place “world class teachers in every classroom.”\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n“We will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,” she said. \nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George’s County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint’s overall success.\n“It lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don’t have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,” she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "content": "As a group of 4-year-old boys worked to create a towering building block castle in their colorful Montgomery County Public Schools pre-K classroom, Head Start teacher Molly Scherf reminded them it is important to build a strong foundation. \nThe boys used their tiny hands to create the tower piece by piece, building the foundation to their castle — and also for their future education. \nWith research showing children who attend pre-K perform better in later years, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future — the state’s landmark education plan — aims to make pre-K much more widely available to every 3- and 4-year-old in the state.\nScherf, who has worked in early childhood education for 30 years, said it’s a great idea.\n“[Pre-K] is not just all about learning the letters of the alphabet or learning how to count to 10, it’s also learning how to get along with your peers,” she said. \nThe state’s plan to make pre-K free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all faces some serious struggles, however. The Blueprint relies on a mix of private providers and public schools to expand the availability of pre-K — but many districts are struggling to enlist enough private providers. On top of that, some public schools that would otherwise host the pre-K population don’t have the room to do so.\nEducators in the state call the Blueprint pre-K plan a “mixed delivery system” that aims to expand pre-K without making it a public school monopoly.\n“So in theory, it’s a great model,” said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Accountability and Implementation Board, the state agency created to oversee the Blueprint. “In practice, it has a lot of challenges.”\nA vast expansion\nThe state says 30,718 children were enrolled in pre-K in Maryland during the 2022-23 school year, and that number is expected to expand as the 10-year Blueprint is implemented. \nThe Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, which drew up the early childhood education effort incorporated into the Blueprint, estimated the changes it proposed would mean 80% of eligible children would be in pre-K when the plan is fully implemented. That’s a lofty goal considering state figures showed the pre-K participation rate for 4-year-olds was below 50% in half of Maryland’s school districts in 2022-23.\nCosts will increase along with the pre-K population. According to the state’s Department of Legislative Services, Blueprint-related early childhood programs cost the state $445 million in fiscal year 2023 alone. While future cost increases depend largely on enrollment, that department projects a 15.7% increase in funding for pre-K programs between fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\nResearch shows that could be a good investment. William T. Gormley, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center for Research on Children in the United States, and his colleagues tracked the results of youngsters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for more than 20 years after they left pre-K. The researchers found that while 44% of children who attended pre-K went on to college, only a third of those who missed out on pre-K went on to higher education.\n“In this respect, early childhood education is indeed the gift that keeps on giving,” Gormley and his colleagues wrote in a 2023 paper.\nThat being the case, Pillar 1 of the Blueprint — early childhood education — calls for government-funded pre-K to be available to all low-income 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 fiscal year. Preschool will be free to all 3- and 4-year-olds from families that earn up to 300% of the federal poverty level. Families with incomes between 300% and 600% of the federal poverty level will pay for pre-K on a sliding scale, and higher-income families will pay for it in full.\nInstead of placing all pre-K students in conventional public school classrooms, the plan relies on participation from both public and private child care providers. Preschool classrooms can either be in public schools or other child care facilities.\nThis will create a diverse set of pre-K options that aims to make child care accessible for limited-income families, according to Molly McGriff, senior director of United for Childcare, an initiative of the United Way of Central Maryland that aims to make child care accessible for limited-income families. \n“That diversity benefits families as they’re able to choose from all different settings that maybe look a little bit different, might be closer to home, might be able to meet their needs better,” she said. \nThe system’s struggles\nSo far, though, the mixed delivery plan is not meeting expectations. \nSchool districts were expected to have 30% of their pre-K slots filled by private providers in the 2022-23 school year, but most school systems did not meet that requirement, according to Brianna January, an associate policy director for the Maryland Association of Counties. \nAnd all but one local school district — Montgomery County Public Schools — requested a waiver after being unable to meet the requirement of having 35% of pre-K seats in the private sector for the 2023-24 school year, said Hise, of the Accountability and Implementation Board.\nWith districts expected to fill half their pre-K slots through private providers by the 2026-27 school year, districts find themselves under increasing pressure to strike deals with companies that provide that service.\n“It’s proving to be a bit more challenging than I think a lot of folks really expected,” January said. \nThe creators of the Blueprint expected private child care providers would be interested in joining the pre-K industry, January explained, but providers are not as eager as had been anticipated. \nFor one thing, there’s a money issue. \n“We recognize that the reimbursement rate for [private] providers is not high enough to incentivize them to provide slots for these 3-year-olds,” said Del. Courtney Watson, D-Howard. “That is a major problem across the state.” \nIn addition, child care providers must overcome a number of barriers before they can actually qualify to offer pre-K.\nFor example, starting in the 2025-26 school year, pre-K teaching assistants will be required to obtain either an associate’s degree or a Child Development Associate certificate. Pre-K teachers will be required to have a bachelor’s degree and hold teaching certification in early childhood education or be enrolled in a certification program. \nThe trouble is some child care providers will not be able to go to school and keep their businesses running at the same time, said Christina Peusch, executive director of the Maryland State Childcare Association.\n“That is set up to fail,” Peusch said. “It’s not equitable.”\nAnother potential barrier is private providers must adhere to Maryland EXCELS — the state’s quality rating and improvement system for child care facilities. Bonuses ranging from $150 to $13,500 will be awarded to participating child care programs on a rating scale of 1 to 5 based on program type, quality rating and capacity. \nSt. Mary’s County has no private providers that are rated “EXCELS 5,” the highest possible ranking, said Kristen Paul, director of early childhood programs at The Parents’ Place of Maryland, which connects parents of children with disabilities and health care needs to resources. \n“We don’t have enough pre-K slots right now,” Paul said. “We’ve got a gap.”\nA space shortage?\nOn top of the struggles in finding private providers, some education experts are concerned there is not enough physical space in some school buildings to accommodate pre-K classrooms.\n“I would love to have pre-K in our school,” said Jamie Miller, principal of Broadneck Elementary School in Anne Arundel County. “But our school building is very, very old and there’s not a place for them. … Every single classroom is full and at max capacity, so I don’t have a space right now.”\nShamoyia Gardiner, executive director of Strong Schools Maryland, an organization created to advocate for the passage of the Blueprint, said she’s worried about such space shortages.\nFor Maryland public schools to offer pre-K, the physical space in buildings must meet standards set by the state’s Interagency Commission on School Construction. But Gardiner noted the commission’s requirements were not aligned with the Blueprint during its creation.\nThat commission — which decides exactly which school construction projects the state will fund — uses a “blunt tool” of measuring the amount of square feet per student, said Lynne Harris, a member of the Montgomery County Board of Education. But that blunt instrument doesn’t take into account that pre-K classrooms have different requirements, such as a bathroom, Harris said.  \n“Are they going to finally acknowledge that to build facilities to house the pre-K programming that is mandated by the Blueprint, it’s going to require the [school construction commission] to relax?” she said. \nSome private providers need more space, too, and the state has a grant program that aims to allow them to expand. \n“The grant is highly competitive,” said Ruby Daniels, president of the Maryland State Family Child Care Association. “When you apply, you’re actually competing with the [local education agencies], which is the public school. You’re completely competing with Head Start, you’re completely competing with child care centers.”\nIn a letter sent to state leaders in November, the Maryland Association of Counties urged lawmakers to increase state aid to construct pre-K facilities and ease requirements to encourage more private providers to take part in the program.\nThis legislative session, the General Assembly is hoping to iron out some of the Blueprint’s wrinkles to ensure Maryland is living up to its promises of expanding and improving early childhood education, said Watson, the Democratic state delegate from Howard County.\nJanuary emphasized the county leaders she works with are dedicated to implementing the Blueprint and collaborating with state leaders to help expand pre-K successfully.\n“We have to work together. We have to get it right,” January said. “County governments are really trying to be good partners and they want to make the Blueprint work. They want to see it successful.”",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland’s Democratic-led legislature passed the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future in 2021, vowing to pour billions of dollars into the state’s public schools to offer universal pre-K, improve teaching and make sure students are ready for college or careers.\nBut the General Assembly didn’t outline a long-term plan to fund the ambitious 10-year education reform effort  — which increasingly looks like a blueprint for red ink.\nDiving deep into the reform plan in reporting “Behind the Blueprint” — a multi-part look at the state effort — the Local News Network at the University of Maryland found that the Blueprint is already devouring hundreds of millions annually from the state’s fund balance, which is on target to be fully drained in 2027.\nAnd according to a state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January, the state will start running a structural deficit in fiscal year 2025 that will multiply nearly sixfold by fiscal year 2029, when it will hit $2.93 billion. Not coincidentally, that fiscal briefing estimates implementing the Blueprint will cost more than $4 billion in 2029.\nThe General Assembly’s plan for dealing with the cost crunch? There isn’t one — at least not yet. Neither Gov. Wes Moore in his State of the State address nor any of the Democratic state legislators interviewed for this story have offered any potential solutions for the coming Blueprint cash crunch.\n“Several years from now we’re going to have to have a much more direct conversation about the long-term costs,” said state Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat from Baltimore City. “But we’re not there yet.”\nRepublicans, meanwhile, see the Blueprint as a budget-breaker.\n“We cannot pay these billions and billions of dollars in extra monies — not just state but local as well,” said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany. “We can’t pay for them unless you’re going to talk about new taxes — and significant taxes.”\nThe Blueprint’s background\nIronically, the Blueprint was born out of a commission supported by a Republican governor — who later backed away from the plan because of cost concerns. \nIn 2016, then-Gov. Larry Hogan and the General Assembly created the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education to assess the public education system in Maryland and determine whether current funding schemes were conducive to student success. \nHeaded by William Kirwan, the former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, the commission came to the conclusion that an overhaul was needed.\n“One of the ‘aha’ moments of the commission was really to face the fact that in Maryland, on what we call the Nation’s Report Card, Maryland’s score was about in the middle … and moving in the wrong direction,” said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, a state entity that’s making sure school districts adhere to the plan.\nBut Hogan had an “aha” moment of his own after Democrats crafted the Kirwan Commission’s report into comprehensive legislation. In 2019, Hogan criticized the pending reform proposal, telling a group of county officials it would mean “billions and billions more in mandated spending increases for county and state taxpayers,” according to The Frederick News-Post.\nHogan vetoed the bill creating the Blueprint in May 2020, saying he did not want to raise taxes amid the COVID-19 pandemic to fund the education plan. The General Assembly overrode his veto in 2021.\nAnd the following year, voters elected a strong backer of the Blueprint — Democrat Wes Moore — to succeed Hogan, who is now running for a U.S. Senate seat.\nOn the first day of the current legislative session that began in January, Moore said he believes in the reform plan and he will work with the General Assembly to ensure the Blueprint is implemented properly and sustainably. \n“I believe in the premise and the promise of the Blueprint. I think we need a world-class education system in the state of Maryland,” Moore said. “I think that’s going to be a prerequisite for us to be able to accomplish the economic goal that we’re hoping for.”\nLofty goals\nIn the state’s 24 public school districts, the Blueprint and its lofty goals are already beginning to take shape.\nEach school district has already drawn up a preliminary plan for how it will meet targets for offering pre-K, increasing teacher salaries and improving student performance. The Accountability and Implementation Board has approved all those plans after first asking for revisions.\nThe Blueprint is meant to revamp the state’s education system by presenting the same opportunities for all students. With a law like the Blueprint, one size has to fit all to achieve its goals of maximizing reading and math skills, as well as increasing pathways into college, said Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel. \n“So we want that for every kid across the state. We don’t want variation of those goals,” Rosapepe said. “Now, the details of how stuff is paid for — I mean, I think that’s a conversation that will be ongoing.”\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said the teachers union is fully behind the Blueprint. \n“We have a shared understanding that our goal is for students to succeed academically and become valuable citizens in our state and in our country,” Bost said. “In order to do that, we have to make an investment in public education. I think for the most part, the Blueprint identifies where that money has to go.”\nWhat it doesn’t do, however, is identify where the money will come from. Bost, whose union represents 74,000 educators in the state, acknowledged the concerns about the Blueprint’s cost. But she indicated the increased spending on education is both needed and long overdue.\n“We constitutionally have to provide a public education for all students, so the investment is needed,” Bost said. “And when some people balk at, ‘Oh, it’s all this money’ — well, we’ve been starving public education for many years.”\nThe budget dilemma\nThe Blueprint remains fully funded in Moore’s latest fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, leaving many lawmakers to turn their attention to other legislative issues this year. Ferguson, the Senate president, said in terms of current Blueprint funding, “we’re more than fine.” \nBut that’s not so in the long term. The cost of implementing the Blueprint is projected to grow from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $4.1 billion five years later, according to the Department of Legislative Services. Meantime, the state’s structural budget gap is set to balloon every year through 2029 — when Legislative Services expects it to be $2.9 billion and the Moore administration says it will be about $3.5 billion.\nClosing that budget gap will be immensely difficult, said Christopher Summers, president and CEO of the conservative Maryland Policy Institute, who also said the Blueprint should be paused.\n“Raising taxes (is) not going to solve this problem, and I think the governor knows that,” said Summers, who has been critical of the Blueprint for years. \nThe Blueprint calls on school districts to increase education funding too, thereby prompting Summers to say that county budgets face the biggest fiscal threat.\nBut in Annapolis, lawmakers from both parties acknowledged that the General Assembly will have to make some tough decisions in the years to come as the Blueprint’s bills come due.\n“I think we know the reality that we’re facing. And I think there’s gonna be a lot of discussion about that,” said State Sen. Guy J. Guzzone, a Democrat from Howard County. “I just don’t know that there’s an immediate answer.”\nOne obvious solution would be raising taxes to cover the state’s coming shortfalls. But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, said a solution lies in cutting back the demands of the Blueprint rather than paying for the sweeping overhaul as it stands.\n“Republicans have stated very often that we need to move to a ‘Blueprint lite’ or you know, some type of education reform that takes some of the important components of the Blueprint, but at the same time is affordable and allows counties to make decisions on which parts of the Blueprint are more meaningful in each of their public school systems,” Hershey said.\nDemocrats, however, back the current Blueprint, despite its cost. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said legislators should start talking about a long-term payment plan for the Blueprint now. The shared values between the legislature and the governor will bring them together, Barnes said, to solve the Blueprint budget dilemma.\n“This legislature, the governor, we share values, and those shared values include all the priorities of the Blueprint,” Barnes said. “Getting to children who live in communities of poverty, taking care of special needs students, I mean, these are what we all ran on. And so I feel confident we’ll find the revenue we need to support that program.”\nSeveral state officials have said they are looking to the Accountability and Implementation Board to issue recommendations regarding the Blueprint’s budget challenges. The board has made policy proposals included in bills that, if passed this legislative session, would make adjustments to the law without changing the finances. \nIn addition, the board is set to release additional recommendations this legislative session. \n“What the AIB has tried to sort of suggest is like, let’s try to implement it the way it’s intended. And if it doesn’t work, if it’s just no longer the right thing to do, then we need to change it,” said Hise, the board’s executive director. “But for many things, we haven’t gotten to that point yet.”",

    "content": "The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a multi-billion dollar endeavor aimed at addressing concerns about the quality of public education in the state, is about to remake virtually every public school in the state. \nAnd this Local News Network project — “Behind the Blueprint” — aims to explain Maryland’s landmark education reform plan. Based on interviews with dozens of education sources as well as a survey of school principals, the project will be published by the University of Maryland’s Capital News Service over the coming weeks.\nIn addition to the accompanying story on the Blueprint’s impact on the state budget, “Behind the Blueprint” features a district-by-district look at the reform plan as well as upcoming stories on each of the plan’s five pillars.\nWhat are the 5 pillars of Maryland’s Blueprint?\n\nEarly Childhood Education: This pillar expands access to full-day government-paid pre-K to all 3- and 4- year- olds from families that are earning incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level, and allows wealthier families to pay for pre-K on a sliding scale based on their income. The goal is to make pre-K available to all 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 school year.\nHigh Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders: With Maryland — like the nation — confronting a teacher shortage, this pillar seeks to attract and retain teachers by raising pay, increasing training and building a new career ladder.\nCollege and Career Readiness: This pillar aims to make all of the state’s students ready for college and careers by the end of 10th grade. The state plans a redrawing of its public school curriculum and a stronger emphasis on early college and vocational training.  \nIncreased Resources: This pillar will increase the state’s per-pupil funding amount annually until the 2032-33 school year. Currently at $8,642, the funding will eventually reach $12,365. But the Blueprint also places additional funding burdens on the state’s school districts.\nGovernance and Accountability: The state created a new agency, the Accountability and Implementation Board, to develop the state’s 10-year Blueprint plan and ensure all districts and schools are following it.  \n\nLater Local News Network stories will detail how the plan will affect other facets of public education in the state.\nRead the full series here.",

Other districts in the state are considering this strategy, making Howard County a front-runner in the state. \nThe district's strategy of bringing Howard Community College staff to high schools to help enroll students in dual enrollment courses aids underserved populations.\nThe county’s eighth-grade career exploration course allows students to start academy programs in time for an apprentice year.\nThe district has good programs to ensure the “equity of access and success” in the AP courses.\n\nNeeds improvement:\n\nHoward County did not engage enough with the community in developing its plan. The district “acknowledged this and plans to engage the community and partners as it moves forward.”\n Like other districts, Howard needs outside help in developing career ladders that go beyond a focus on salary incentives and National Board Certification.\nThe district has not updated its math strategy since 2016 and it is not clear if its new update, which includes more than 20 new tools and materials, will fit together in a well-organized approach to math. \nHoward County’s plan does not expand upon its current college and career readiness initiatives, even though the Blueprint calls for robust improvements in this area.\nThe district has significant enrollment in advanced placement courses, dual enrollment and technical education, but it is not clear how they will be organized into clear pathways for students. \n\n– Eddy Calkins",

One potential strategy is to partner with higher education institutions.\nThe district should broaden its National Board Certification planning to encourage teachers to get that credential.\nThe county has comprehensive training plans for teachers in reading, math and related programs, but it has little information on how successful that training  is.

This effort should focus on historically underrepresented and underperforming students to ensure these students receive timely support. \n\n– Stella Canino-Quinones",

Efforts include a virtual job shadowing platform and hiring a district level liaison who “serves as a bridge between the schools and businesses.” \nQueen Anne’s mathematics plan is comprehensive and has a strong emphasis on highly rated materials and tools. The district has also recently updated its literacy plan to fit with Blueprint requirements.\n\nNeeds improvement:\n\nQueen Anne’s County will not meet the necessary 10% teacher salary increase by the required date of June 30, 2024. Queen Anne’s plans to reopen negotiations during the school year and its next arbitration agreement must be in line with Blueprint law. \nHistorically, Queen Anne’s has trouble staffing math, world language and secondary education teaching positions, while recent shortages have caused hurdles in filling special education, elementary and secondary positions in all levels.

The district should ensure that students can access tutoring during the school day, that students who have to repeat a core class are offered a more engaging learning experience, and that students who take advanced courses have access to support. \nThe district should establish data-monitoring systems to ensure students are not disproportionately grouped into different levels. \n\n– Shaun Chornobroff",

    "content": "WASHINGTON –  The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration’s plans to make college more affordable.\nThe College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel’s chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden’s efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n“Unfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,” said Foxx, “Congress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.”\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden’s original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration’s plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx’s College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation. \nRep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, praised parts of Foxx’s bill, “such as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,” but the panel’s ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning, D-Michigan, offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions. \nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano, D-California, introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Michigan, offered a motion to remove the bill’s rescission of Biden’s SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n“The new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration… creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,” Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Michigan, unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici’s proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – After the back-to-back shootings in October at Morgan State University and Bowie State University, advocates for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) say that underfunding is leading to lack of proper safety and security resources on their campuses.\nTheir concerns have drawn support from Capitol Hill.\nRep. Alma Adams, D-North Carolina, and the founder of the Congressional HBCU Caucus, sent letters to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Dr. Miguel Cardona and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, saying there needs to be a “concerted effort to provide funding to HBCUs for them to protect their student body and faculty from violence.”\nShe added that safety and security on HBCU campuses must be a “top priority” and requested that her office meet regularly with the Biden administration to discuss funding and safety concerns.\nOn Oct. 3, five people were injured after a shooting on Morgan State’s campus during homecoming festivities. Just four days later, two people were injured after a shooting on Bowie State’s campus, also during homecoming.\nRyan Coleman, president of the Randallstown NAACP, was on Bowie State’s campus visiting family when the shooting happened. The police presence on campus that night was not sufficient, he said.\n“You saw some police…but it became really obvious that they weren’t walking around the campus…they weren’t patrolling like that,” he said. “There were multiple events on the campus with multiple people. And there just wasn’t any police presence at those individual events.”\nColeman described the scene during the shooting as “chaos.” While sheltering in a dorm with his family, he said he saw people running and trying to get off campus, and that the police didn’t start evacuating campus until about an hour later.\n“The Bowie State University Police were over their heads, it was obvious they did not have the police resources to handle this,” Coleman said. “If there was an active shooter who actually wanted to do harm to students, I have no faith that that person would’ve been stopped at all.”\nAfter the shooting, Bowie State President Aminta Breaux said the school would revisit the idea of adding metal detectors to campus, but emphasized that “no one person has the solution to all the challenges the university faces.”\nBowie State University did not respond to a request for comment about the police presence during the shooting there.\nAt Morgan State, President David K. Wilson announced his plan to extend a fence barrier around campus, saying it will help limit “unfettered pedestrian access.”\nThe school also said it plans to hire more police officers, implement more security cameras around campus and add metal detectors at entrances. The measures will cost millions of dollars and the school said it hopes to receive additional state and federal funding.\nAfter watching the shooting unfold at Morgan State, Coleman wrote a letter to the president of Howard University, where his daughter is enrolled, urging the school to take action during its homecoming celebration in October, including increasing police presence and adding metal detectors at entrances to events, among other precautions.\nAt its homecoming celebration, Howard officials said that safety was their “main priority” ahead of the events, and the school had its campus police and Metro police patrolling campus.\nOn Monday, college officials across Maryland gathered behind closed doors to discuss campus safety in the wake of the Morgan State shooting. They discussed prevention technology on campus, and the importance of doing checks on existing security measures, like security cameras, according to WBAL in Baltimore.\nCampus officials also emphasized the importance of community policing, and that schools should partner with surrounding police departments.\nColeman said that when he has visited the University of Maryland or other non-HBCUs in Maryland, those institutions seem to have the resources they need, whether it’s funding, programming or security on campus.\nMaryland HBCU Advocates spokeswoman Sharon Blake echoed Coleman, saying that underfunding at the institutions is widespread, whether it is in programming, scholarships or security.\n“When you don’t have enough money, you cut corners wherever you can. And that, of course, does include public safety, and that’s unfortunate,” Blake said.\nIn Congress, Adams has passed many bills that supporting HBCUs. Last year, in the wake of bomb threats against HBCU campuses across the country, Adams passed a resolution that condemned violence at HBCUs and reaffirmed Congress’s support for these schools.\nIn 2019, Adams also passed legislation that established two fiscal years’ worth of mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions.\nEarlier this year, the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) proposed legislation that would direct $100 million each year from FEMA’s non-profit grants security program to go towards safety initiatives on HBCU campuses. Adams’ office said she is “strongly in favor” of this proposal.\nIn terms of federal funding, the Biden-Harris administration has invested over $7 million in the nation’s HBCUs, and has directed money in the 2022 and 2023 spending packages, specifically supporting scholarships and grants, as well as institutional development.\nWhile the administration has not specifically increased funding for campus safety in reference to shootings, the Department of Education did secure over $2 million in grants to help schools recover after violent events, such as bomb threats.\nAdditionally, in September, the Biden administration sent letters to the governors of 16 states, including Maryland, asking them to direct more money for their land-grant HBCUs.\nIn the letters, Cardona and Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack said they found that the states’ land-grant HBCUs received a collective $13 billion less than they should have in the last few decades, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nMaryland’s land-grant HBCU is the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which the analysis found to have a $321 million funding gap in state appropriations in the last 30 years, compared to the predominantly white land-grant universities in the state, including the University of Maryland College Park.\n“The longstanding and ongoing underinvestment in University of Maryland Eastern Shore disadvantages the students, faculty, and community that the institution serves,” the two secretaries wrote. “It is our hope that we can work together to make this institution whole after decades of being underfunded.”\nThe letter also acknowledges that the state government has been making steps toward addressing the funding gap in recent years.\nIn 2021, then-Gov. Larry Hogan approved legislation giving $577 million to Maryland HBCUs over a decade, which Moore has said he will uphold, according to his office.\nMoore allocated $422 million for all four schools in his first budget, and in February approved $3 million in grants to three schools, including Morgan State and Bowie State. Since Moore took office, funding for Maryland HBCUs has increased over 20%, according to his office.\nMoore’s office said that he “firmly believes that every student deserves to feel safe on campus and that everyone involved needs to work hard to ensure that these tragedies no longer take place in Maryland.”\nBut even the increased funding and support still does not rectify decades of underfunding, Coleman said.\n“Even if (HBCUs) are given some money…they’ve been underfunded for 30 or 40 years, and they’re not really being brought to a whole,” he said.",

    "content": "SABILLASVILLE, Md. — The graduate’s mom, peers and teachers knew he was going to reach his goal, though his principal, Todd Rasher, said the other students incarcerated at the Victor Cullen Center in rural northern Frederick County didn’t see “all the footwork” it took to earn his GED.\n“This diploma ain’t really too much because I knew that I was going to get it,” the 17-year-old said to his graduation audience on Oct. 18, wearing a cap and gown, kente stole and black wristband adorned with, “Don’t give up.” \nThe graduate, whose identity CNS is shielding because he is a minor, was charged as an adult before his case was transferred to juvenile court. Rasher said he passed the tests necessary to earn his GED on the first try, inspiring his fellow students to take the tests themselves. \nThe graduate’s mom, TaNeya Anderson, said that services she and her son received since her son was locked up, including family therapy and regular updates from Cullen staff, have helped her family. \n“It might seem like it was a bad thing that he ended up having to get incarcerated, but I’m always trying to get the good out of it, and I believe it was meant for this to happen this way,” Anderson said.\nNot all incarcerated young people are able to continue their education, much less attain a degree. Two years after the Maryland General Assembly transferred responsibility for incarcerated students’ education from the state Education Department to an independent school board within the Juvenile Services Department, students confined in Maryland’s secure youth facilities continue to face multiple long-standing challenges, according to experts and state audit reports.\n\nTeacher vacancy rates of 30% in the most populous Juvenile Services schools have led to reliance on streaming instruction in subjects such as math and science.\nIncarcerated students were late to class hundreds of times in 2023 due to the security requirements — especially a state Juvenile Services policy mandating that staff supervise and escort youth while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. \nA lack of guidance from the State Board of Education has allowed local school boards broad scope to reject students charged with various offenses, including those who have been in detention, arguing they are a threat – even when Juvenile Services and the courts have decided it’s safe to release them.\n\nTwo of the state’s three most populous youth detention centers and its only long-term placement facility, Cullen, operated with teacher vacancy rates around 30% as of early October, according to documents discussed in public meetings of the Juvenile Services Education Program Board. The Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, which served 301 students that year, had eight vacancies. The Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, which served 245 students, had seven. Cullen, which served 76 students, had four.\nWhen facilities lack subject experts to teach in person, students take classes livestreamed by juvenile services teachers from the Garrett Children’s Center, a former youth committed placement center in Garrett County. \nThree of the nine Juvenile Services schools, including Hickey and Cullen, had no math teacher as of October, while four, including Hickey and the Baltimore center, lacked a science teacher. Baltimore’s Juvenile Justice Center was looking for a second math teacher to serve its large population. \nDavid Domenici, director of education and senior adviser to the Juvenile Services secretary, said streaming instruction is “not ideal” for the “vast majority” of students but better than packets of photocopied activities.\nJuvenile Services teacher vacancies have persisted through tensions between Maryland’s education and Juvenile Services agencies over the past decade about who bears responsibility for educating incarcerated young people and how best to do so. Those vacancies continue through teachers’  lack of summer and winter breaks and low pay relative to teachers employed by local school districts.\nLawmakers voted in 2004 to stage the Education Department’s takeover of Juvenile Services schools over eight years but repeatedly extended the timeline as Education protested inadequate funding. Bills seeking pay parity and summer breaks for juvenile services teachers failed in 2016, 2019 and 2020, often pitting experts from Education and Juvenile Services against each other. The General Assembly established a statewide education board within Juvenile Services in 2021 in response to monitors’ and advocacy groups’ repeated findings of high staff turnover and vacancies, inadequate services for learning disabled students and a lack of support for students returning to community schools. But the law did not require pay parity or align facilities’ teaching calendar more closely with local schools.\nPeter Leone, an emeritus University of Maryland education professor contracted by the Education Department to assess its work in Juvenile Services facilities between 2016 and 2018, said that educating incarcerated students was “a very low priority” for the Education department.\nThe Education Department declined to comment on its management of Juvenile Services education or on the current board.\nWhile public school teachers earn salaries set by local school boards, Juvenile Services teachers are paid on a single, statewide pay scale. Juvenile services teachers experience the greatest pay disparities in jurisdictions where local school boards pay the most. \nThe Juvenile Services board has implemented hiring and retention bonuses that board superintendent Kim Pogue said she hopes will improve recruitment.\nEven with these bonuses, teachers in the state’s largest youth detention centers, in Baltimore and Prince George’s County, earn less per day than teachers working in local schools. A teacher at Hickey or Baltimore’s Juvenile Justice Center makes 9.5% less daily than a teacher in neighboring Baltimore County. A teacher at Cheltenham makes 3.9% less than a Prince George’s County teacher. In Washington County, teachers at the Western Maryland Children’s Center make 10.2% less than county teachers.\nDomenici said the board would have to decide whether to seek legislative or other changes to teacher pay and work schedules. Domenici, who is not a board member, said the legislature should have set 10- and 12-month employee categories, established a school calendar limiting when Juvenile Services teachers can take leave and creating a regional pay scale aligned with local districts.\nBut lost instructional time is greatest due to a lack of residential advisers, according to audits of Juvenile Services schools by the state Office of the Inspector General. Departmental policy requires that residential staff escort students from their living units to classrooms while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. When there aren’t enough residential staff, students don’t move. \nStudents were late to class 203 times across Juvenile Services facilities due to residential staff shortages between April and June alone, according to the audits. Teachers had to teach class inside the living units 43 times in the 90-day inspection period.\nGetting students in the classroom, even if they are late, Domenici said, is better than class on the living units. The department is working toward a goal of 90% on-time attendance in school by shifting all onsite adults to escort students to school, he said.\nSpending time in detention or committed placement hurts students’ education in the longer term.\nLegal experts and youth advocates say students who have been detained face obstacles returning to school due to overly broad state laws and an absence of guidance to local school systems from the Department of Education.\nLaw enforcement is required to report to superintendents and principals when students are charged with certain “reportable offenses” outside of school, including rape, first degree assault and carjacking.\nExperts say a 2022 state law limiting when local school systems can exclude students based on charges does not lay out a statewide standard to assess whether students present a threat nor outline procedures to protect students’ and parents’ rights. \nRegulations that the State Board of Education has proposed to flesh out the law provide insufficient protections, according to comments submitted by the Public Defender’s Office, Disability Rights Maryland and the Public Justice Center.\nAlyssa Fieo, assistant public defender for education in the Juvenile Protection Division of the Maryland Public Defender’s Office, said she has worked on a handful of cases involving reportable offenses in at least five counties since the passage of the 2022 law.\nSchools failed to hold required meetings between parents and school officials before students’ removal to establish whether students presented a threat, and schools don’t invite students’ attorneys when they do. In one case, the school system did not hold a required meeting to determine whether the alleged offense was a manifestation of a student’s disability before removing the student. In most of the cases, students were recently released from detention.\n“A handful of the cases I’ve represented, the family got a phone call saying, ‘We understand your child has a charge. They’re going to be put on virtual school. We’re going to drop off the computer,’” Fieo said.\nState law requires the state’s attorney to promptly notify school officials of the ruling on a student’s case, and the proposed regulations would require schools to then review the student’s school assignment. The three organizations are asking the Education Department to clarify that students should be allowed to return to school once the state’s attorney, Juvenile Services and the courts have approved the student’s return to the community. There is currently no limit on how long a “reportable offense” charge can be used as a reason to exclude a student from regular instruction.\nAt Cullen, Rasher said, he has access to any student’s record, but he chooses not to look.\n“I know everybody has a story,” he said. “Some are pretty awful. But to me, that’s not a thing.”\nThe day the graduate walked up to the podium and moved his tassel from one side of his cap to the other, he focused on his future: He was set to start work on an occupational safety certification the next day.\nThe graduate said Cullen’s walls enclose a complex reality that outsiders can’t see, and that the youth of Cullen are just as complex.\n“You can’t just judge a book by its cover like they say, for real,” he said. “If all of us in here, our cover is just what they show on the media or the news, you feel me, but they don’t know what actually goes on inside of here. …If you’re on the outside looking in, you’re not going to see what we see. Because we here.”\n“I’m proud of what I did,” he said. “I’m definitely proud about it, but it’s more to come, so.”",
