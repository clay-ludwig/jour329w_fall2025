    "content": "SAN MATEO, Calif. \u2013 On a cool Friday morning in April, the halls of California\u2019s San Mateo High School were full of students chatting, running to class or trying to find their friends.\u00a0\nBut one common sight in high schools across the country was and always is absent from the halls of San Mateo: cellphones.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you look at the crowd, kids are not buried in their phone,\u201d said Yvonne Shiu, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cThey have grown to value being in the moment.\u201d\nSan Mateo High School Principal Yvonne Shiu works in her office on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nStudents at the public high school about 20 minutes south of San Francisco have been prohibited since 2019 from using their cellphones while in school \u2014 from bell to bell. Schools nationwide, including some in Maryland, are now increasingly imposing such bans, but San Mateo was one of the earliest and largest schools in the country to implement a complete ban on cellphones during school hours.\nAt the start of each day, each of the 1,600 students lock their phone in a magnetically sealed pouch, created by the San Francisco-based company Yondr, that won\u2019t be opened until the school day ends.\nThe decision to introduce Yondr pouches was the school\u2019s attempt to tackle the increasingly pervasive effects of cellphone and social media overuse on its student body: cyberbullying, loss of sleep, self-esteem issues and endless distractions in class.\u00a0\nTeachers and administrators quickly embraced the program, saying it restored their grasp on students\u2019 attention in class. Some even said if the school were to end the program, they\u2019d leave.\nAs schools around the country implement similar cellphone bans, San Mateo offers a six-year track record of how a cellphone ban can force young people to focus and, in many cases, feel better.\u00a0\n\u201cIf schools can help alleviate some of those expectations and pressures about appearance and performance and embarrassment, and take away some of those elements that a lot of kids really struggle with and are confronted with, that is a benefit to them and to the school community and the school culture,\u201d said Casey Teague, a longtime world history teacher at the school.\nA slow start\nThe decision to implement the Yondr program at San Mateo began with observation and a trial run.\nOne of its faculty members, Alicia Gorgani, observed a similar cellphone ban at San Lorenzo High School, a smaller school in the area, and brought the idea to San Mateo\u2019s teachers and administrators.\nAdam Gelb, San Mateo\u2019s assistant principal at the time, said seeing the cellphone ban in action at San Lorenzo \u201cblew [his] mind.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStudents were engaged with one another,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were interacting. They were playing card games. They were playing out on the yard. They were goofing around. They were in circles, talking to each other.\u201d\nGelb helped bring the program to San Mateo, which tested Yondr pouches in a few classrooms in spring 2019.\nTeague, who\u2019s worked at the school for more than 20 years, was one of those first instructors to pilot the program. He said he decided to try out the Yondr pouches in his class after noticing students\u2019 smartphones were constantly bombarding them with notifications.\n\u201cBy 2018, every kid had a phone. That wasn\u2019t anything new,\u201d Teague said. \u201cBut the distracting nature of the phone was becoming more and more obvious.\u201d\nSan Mateo health education teacher Brittany Dybdahl poses for a portrait on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nHealth education teacher Brittany Dybdahl said leading up to the ban, the school was seeing an increase in cyberbullying and drama stemming from online activities.\nEmbarrassing moments or conflicts among students had the risk of getting captured on video and being immortalized online.\n\u201cIt basically created way more opportunities for students to be emotionally impacted throughout the school day,\u201d Dybdahl said. \u201cAnd that would, of course, affect their academics and learning.\u201d\nAfter the pilot program, and many discussions with students and their parents, San Mateo implemented the program schoolwide beginning in the 2019-20 academic year.\nSome teachers were apprehensive about the cellphone ban, thinking it would create more work for first-period teachers to check that each student had their phones sealed away.\u00a0\nBut those checks quickly became part of the daily routine, said physics teacher Patrick Thrasher.\nAnd after seeing the impact the program had on their students, most faculty members got on board, Thrasher said.\n\u201cThere was such a pretty clear, drastic difference in the classroom,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just night and day.\u201d\nSan Mateo\u2019s cellphone ban was not even a year old when the COVID-19 pandemic moved all learning online for a year starting in March 2020. But the school decided to continue the cellphone ban when students returned to the classroom in 2021.\n\u201cThey do spend enough time already on screens that, you know, seven hours a day here at school [without screen time] is not going to kill them,\u201d Shiu said.\nThe student reaction\nEnforcement of the ban hasn\u2019t been entirely without issues.\u00a0\nSan Mateo faculty members said some students \u2014 albeit a small percentage \u2014 are determined to bypass the Yondr pouches and keep their phones on them. Some put calculators, hard drives or other phone-shaped objects in their Yondr pouches. Others put old, unused \u201cburner phones\u201d in their pouches while keeping their personal phone on them.\nSan Mateo junior Lulu Bertolina poses for a portrait on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nBut many San Mateo students, like junior Lulu Bertolina, embraced the program. She said the Yondr program was one of the reasons she enrolled at San Mateo.\n\u201cHaving our phones [in Yondr pouches] made it easier to make friends, because I can\u2019t go off on my phone and not make conversation with people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt almost forced it \u2014 in a really good way.\u201d\nFor San Mateo senior Siddharth Gogi, the absence of phones made the school feel more welcoming. He said students aren\u2019t glued to their phones playing video games at lunch or distracted on social media in class.\n\u201cConversations move past surface level when you have that time to talk to one another,\u201d said Gogi, San Mateo\u2019s three-time class president who graduated this spring.\u00a0\nHe acknowledged, though, that some students are concerned about not having quick access to their phones in case of an emergency.\nIn the early 2000s, many schools repealed their cellphone restrictions after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.\nBut Shiu said it\u2019s better if students don\u2019t have access to their phones during an emergency. The pouches prevent students and family members from sharing misinformation or flooding 911 with calls overwhelming first responders and the cellphone network.\n\u201cIn any emergency, we want students to be focused on the adult giving the information,\u201d Shiu said.\nThe experts\u00a0\nTo hear the experts tell it, there\u2019s an overriding good reason for schools to ban cellphones. Cellphone use and social media sites can both have a serious impact on young peoples\u2019 well-being.\u00a0\nExtensive cellphone use during the day has a \u201cdirect correlation with a decline in mental health,\u201d said Annette Anderson, the deputy director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.\n\u201cWe also know that cellphone use late into the evening has a disruptive factor in our young people getting enough sleep and then being attentive enough in the morning,\u201d Anderson said.\nYoung people are grappling with the reality that the phone in their hand could be doing them harm. A Pew Research Survey released in April found almost half of U.S. teens age 13 to 17 agreed social media sites have a mostly negative impact on kids their age.\u00a0\u00a0\nSan Mateo wellness counselor Helen Citrin poses for a portrait on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nSan Mateo wellness counselor Helen Citrin said a cellphone ban can provide students a much-needed break from their phones.\nFor students who are highly anxious or struggle managing their emotions, Citrin said, not having access to a cellphone can help as it prevents them from constantly texting their parents.\n\u201cThat pouch offers a boundary,\u201d she said.\nOne recent study echoed this sentiment. Independent research on school cellphone bans is limited, but a 2024 study conducted by Yondr found that students saw a 15% increase in the likelihood they received a passing grade after their school implemented Yondr pouches. The report also found a 44% decrease in behavioral referrals after implementation.\nData from San Mateo paints a mixed picture of the school\u2019s performance since implementation of the cellphone ban. Math and English test scores declined from 2019 through 2024, but both the graduation rate and preparedness for college and careers have inched upward. Meanwhile, the suspension rate increased.\nGelb offered an explanation for the rise: \u201cEverybody was forced to communicate in person, so you had more people talking, and there\u2019s more chance for someone to say the wrong thing or be in the wrong place.\u201d\nBut, he added, the premeditated incidents and cyberbullying disappeared from the school day.\nA growing trend\nAlthough San Mateo might have been early to the cellphone ban movement, it\u2019s among growing company now.\u00a0\nState and local governments and school districts across the country are now considering \u2014 or have already passed \u2014 policies on cellphone use in school. Yondr boasts that millions of students from all 50 states are now using its pouches.\nA San Mateo High School student shows off a Yondr pouch on April 11, 2025. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nWhile there is no statewide ban in Maryland, more than a third of its public schools prohibit cellphone use, Capital News Service reported in October. Several school districts, including Howard and Baltimore counties, have passed a total ban.\u00a0\nAbout 30% of U.S. schools now have a ban on cellphone use throughout the school day, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat percentage is likely to rise. In the nation\u2019s largest state, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation last year requiring all public and charter schools in California to create a policy to reduce or ban cellphone use during school hours by July 1, 2026, but left each school or school district to decide the specifics of their policy.\u00a0\nAnd recently, New York joined the more than two dozen other states instituting a complete ban on cellphones during school hours.\nDemocratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said the decision comes as part of the state\u2019s efforts to protect youth mental health.\n\u201cOur young people succeed when they\u2019re learning and growing, not clicking and scrolling,\u201d Hochul said in a statement in May.\nA model to follow?\u00a0\nSan Mateo faculty and staff said the school\u2019s careful implementation of the Yondr program and the conversations it had with families and educators led to its success.\u00a0\nBut several San Mateo faculty members said Yondr alone can\u2019t solve youth mental health issues stemming from social media and personal devices.\u00a0\nThe exterior of San Mateo High School on April 11, 2025. Since 2019, students at the school have been prohibited from using their phones during the school day. (Sam Gauntt/Capital News Service)\nThe second students leave school grounds, they once again have access to their phones and can browse as much as they want. Citrin, the school\u2019s wellness counselor, said many of the students she deals with stay up late into the night doomscrolling, or texting or video chatting with friends.\nThat being the case, Gelb said schools should also teach students how to develop a healthy relationship with their phone and social media.\nThe pouches also carry a financial impact on schools.\u00a0\nEach student at San Mateo receives a free Yondr pouch at the beginning of the school year, but each replacement costs $15. In total, Shiu estimated the school spends about $20,000 a year on Yondr pouches.\nHowever, San Mateo teachers and administrators said the program\u2019s benefits outweigh its costs.\n\u201cFrom a school perspective, it keeps kids off of their phone during class time,\u201d Citrin said. \u201cBecause the main focus here is education, that\u2019s what the purpose is, and that\u2019s what the use is benefiting.\u201d",

    "content": "Karen Siska-Creel, Anne Arundel County\u2019s school health and support director, knows from experience that if a problem pops up in the community, it won\u2019t take long for it to appear in schools.\nWhen the opioid epidemic began to spread in Anne Arundel County around 2016, Siska-Creel\u00a0 saw local fire departments establish pop-up stations to help people suffering from addiction. But it wasn\u2019t until a high schooler pleaded with school nurses and the health department for help with their addiction that she realized the depth of need in the public school system.\n\u201cThe nurse tried and tried and tried \u2014 so did the school counselor \u2014 tried to plug this student into services. And we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Siska-Creel said. \u201cThe child left, was very upset, left, didn\u2019t show up for two weeks, and had died of an overdose.\u201d\u00a0\nWithin the next year, Siska-Creel helped create the Screening Teens to Access Recovery Program in Anne Arundel County Public Schools. Called the STAR program, it\u2019s a partnership with the county Department of Health that allows school nurses to pair middle and high schoolers with substance abuse treatment services. Siska-Creel said since its inception, about 50 students have been referred to services.\u00a0\nFor Ryan Voegtlin, the assistant superintendent of student services at Anne Arundel County Public Schools, the program was born from a \u201cgap in service\u201d in substance abuse treatment for youth.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s no like we have hundreds of kids coming to access screening through the STAR Program every year,\u201d Voegtlin said. \u201cBut it is an opportunity for them to get a screening and to get pointed in the right direction.\u201d\nHow it works\nAbout a day after the STAR Program\u2019s launch was announced, Siska-Creel said, a student walked into their school\u2019s nurse\u2019s office with a paper in hand.\n\u201c\u2018My dad said to either get help or don\u2019t come home,\u2019\u201d Siska-Creel recalls the student saying.\u00a0\nThe youngster, who went to their nurse\u2019s office, was then given an iPad in a private room, where they were connected to a licensed therapist and asked questions about their possible addiction or mental health struggles. The same process is used for any student in the program, Siska-Creel said.\u00a0\nFrom there, the student will then receive a list of services, said Darin Ford, the program manager of the adolescents and family services division in the health department.\nThe STAR Program also requires a student\u2019s consent for their parents or guardians to be told about them seeking services, Ford said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt really creates a safe space for teens, for youth, to feel like they don\u2019t have to worry about what others might be thinking about them. It\u2019s all protected,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, especially during this day in age, for teens to know if they\u2019re dealing with substance use or substance misuse, that there\u2019s a safe space for them to go to get the help that they need.\u201d\nThe health department will check in with a student who sought services a week after their screening to see if they contacted the resources or needed any others, Ford added. This way, the program provides treatment that lets students come when they need it \u2014 a strategy highly recommended when treating substance abuse, according to Jen Corbin, the director of Anne Arundel County\u2019s crisis response.\u00a0\nContinuing to push students to receive treatment could be read as applying too much pressure,\u00a0Ford said.\nThe strategy \u2014 scientifically recognized as the Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment approach \u2014 is widely used to identify people who might show symptoms of addiction or possibility of developing an addiction in the future, according to the National Institute of Health.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s mainly used for youth and is expanding beyond doctors\u2019 offices, an approach that studies in the Journal of Adolescent Health evaluated to be highly effective, especially once they\u2019re added to schools.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you ask the question, \u2018What was the age that you first used the substance? What substance was it?\u2019 Most of the gateway stuff was, \u2018I used at 13, 14, 15,\u2019\u201d Corbin said of her screenings at Safe Stations, a program that she helped start that hosts mental health and substance abuse screenings in the county\u2019s police and fire stations. \u201cThe conversation grew to, do we need to go back to making sure we\u2019re educating our kids?\u201d\u00a0\nOrigin and limitations\nUnder the STAR Program, school nurses\u2019 offices act as the safe stations where students can be connected to treatment, Corbin said..\n\u201cWhen someone comes walking in, they\u2019re more likely to grab the hand of the person out and say \u2018Hey, I\u2019m ready to get help,\u2019 versus if I go to you and say \u2018Hey, you overdosed, would you like help?\u2019\u201d Corbin said. \u201cThey may not be ready, they may not even want to talk to you, they may deny overdosing.\u201d\nOther school systems, such as in King County, Washington state, have somewhat different programs. There, the Snoqualmie Valley School District administers screenings to all middle school students.\u00a0\nFamilies are also able to withdraw their students from taking the screening, according to the district\u2019s website. The same goes for some state-mandated programs, such as one established in Massachusetts in 2016.\u00a0\nBut Anne Arundel County Public Schools are taking a different approach: one that relies on students to seek help.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a balance in really respecting the student, just like you would respect an adult,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s really client-centered and motivated, versus directive.\u201d\u00a0\nDown to the numbers\nResearchers discovered that programs such as STAR are generally effective. In a Journal of Adolescent Health study conducted in 2022, researchers discussed student-based programs like STAR with 26 students in middle school \u2014 or grades six to eight \u2014 who had received screenings and interventions. The surveyed students overwhelmingly said they were satisfied with the approach, the study found.\nSharon Reif, a faculty member at Brandeis University\u2019s Heller School for Social Policy and Management in Massachusetts and lead author of another 2022 paper in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that screening and intervention services such as the STAR Program are typically low cost.\u00a0\nBut her study also acknowledged the costs of these programs are generally unknown past being integrated into schools that can receive state or federal grant funding.\n\u201cThe issue is when you\u2019re outside of those healthcare settings, insurance tends to actually say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to pay for things that are out there,\u2019 even if they\u2019re sort of healthcare,\u201d Reif said. \u201cAnd if you want to get kids, if you want to get youth, the healthcare setting is not the best place to get them, because they\u2019re not there that often in the way that older people are.\u201d\nThe implementation cost also depends on who conducts the screenings, Reif added. Having a doctor screen students is typically more expensive than having a school nurse or other aide do it, Reif said.\n\u201cHaving a doctor do something is very expensive, having a nurse is less expensive, having a PA or an aide is less expensive,\u201d Reif said. \u201cSo it partly gets to that in terms of, how do you pay for it, and whose time is the most valuable?\u201d\u00a0\nSafe Stations is predominantly funded by grants from the Anne Arundel County Health Department, Corbin said. The STAR Program is also primarily funded by the department, as well as Anne Arundel County Public Schools for its middle school portion.\u00a0\nA 2024 Maryland Community Health Resources Commission showed more than $6 million in grants allocated toward the Anne Arundel County Department of Health for Thrive Behavioral Health, one of the contracting services that conducts screenings for middle schoolers, along with other substance abuse grants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just continuing in getting the word out and figuring out where those gaps are and offering services,\u201d Voegtlin said. \u201cDefinitely scouring for grants where we can find grants that meet our needs. That\u2019s the name of the game right now.\u201d\nAnne Arundel County has continued to increase funding for its Health Department. Its budget has increased by nearly 23% since fiscal 2023, according to county budget documents.\u00a0\nMoving forward\nAbout 48.5 million people suffered from a substance abuse disorder in 2023, according to a survey conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nBut of that amount, just about 7.1 million people received treatment.\nThe state\u2019s Youth Risk Behavior Survey does not track addiction, but it does study drug use by Maryland high school students. The latest survey, from the 2022-23 school year, showed 11.1% of high school students statewide had used prescription opioids without a prescription.\u00a0 That\u2019s down from 15.2% 10 years earlier, but drug abuse continues to be a grave concern for those who work with teens.\nFor Voegtlin, ensuring students know where the services are is most important for the program to grow, while also protecting students\u2019 autonomy in the process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of this balance,\u201d Voegtlin said. \u201cWe want kids to come, but don\u2019t want them to feel stigmatized about going there, right?\u201d\nAs struggles with substance abuse evolve, Siska-Creel said she\u2019s not sure where the STAR Program will grow, either. She focuses on the community to tell next steps about the program, she added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really what\u2019s ever going on in the community,\u201d Siska-Creel said. \u201cI\u2019ll see it in the schools. It eventually comes in.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on April 22 regarding a Maryland case where parents are challenging the ban on opting out their children from LGBTQ+ themed book lessons in public schools, arguing it violates their constitutional right to direct their children's religious upbringing. The debate centers around whether schools should accommodate religious and family rights by allowing opt-outs for such lessons.",
    "content": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on April 22 about whether families have the right to excuse their children from public school lessons featuring books with LGBTQ+ themes.\nThe case, which originated in Maryland\u2019s largest school system, raised a national debate of how schools will address religious and family rights in public education.\nMontgomery County Public Schools, a religiously diverse school system serving about 160,000 students, expanded its school curriculum in 2022 to include books featuring LGBTQ+ characters.\nSome Montgomery County schools allowed families to excuse their children from lessons where the books were read aloud. But in March 2023, the school system banned the opt-out policy and said parents would no longer be notified when the books were read.\nA group of Muslim, Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox parents then sued the system, arguing that their constitutional right to religion lets them pull children from lessons regarding gender and sexuality. After lower courts disagreed with the parents, they took their case to the higher court.\nThe targeted books in this case include titles such as \u201cUncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding,\u201d which features two men getting married and \u201cLove, Violet,\u201d which tells the story of a girl who develops a crush on a female classmate.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard more than two hours of arguments about the case on April 22. Many justices voiced that they had read through the books themselves.\nEric Baxter, the attorney representing the Montgomery County parents, said banning the opt-out policy violates parents\u2019 ability to direct their children\u2019s religious upbringing. In a school system where many students opt out of lessons daily for a variety of reasons, Baxter said, there is no basis for denying opt-outs for religious reasons.\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. emphasized that the school board is not required to change its curriculum, but simply provide an opt-out option for parents.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t that feasible?\u201d Alito said. \u201cWhat is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?\u201d\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh, a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, said he is \u201cmystified\u201d how it came to this. Kavanaugh said he does not understand how an opt-out policy is not possible when every other school board in the county implements opt outs for a variety of reasons.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not understanding feasibility,\u201d he said.\nKavanaugh expressed similar sentiments to Alito, stressing that parents are not asking the school board to change classroom instruction, but instead give their children the ability to be excused from certain lessons.\nJustice Elena Kagan said that she suspects many non-religious parents are not thrilled about the board\u2019s revocation of the opt-out policy.\nBut Kagan also questioned the limits of implementing an opt-out policy. She asked if religious parents who objected to course material, regardless of their child\u2019s age or the material\u2019s content, would immediately receive an opt out.\n\u201cIt will be like opt outs for everyone,\u201d Kagan said.\nAlan Shoenfeld, the attorney representing the school board, said children encounter ideas in the classroom daily that conflict with their religious beliefs, but learning about them does not burden free exercise of religion\nThe opt-out policy would require schools to find alternative classrooms, extra supervision and substitute lessons to accommodate students missing class, he added.\nLiberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson appeared to support the school board\u2019s decision to eliminate the opt-out policy.\nSotomayor questioned if simply exposing children to books, such as by displaying them on library shelves or reading them to children, meant coercion.\nShe questioned how the court a should draw a line in terms of using religious grounds to opt children out of other lessons \u2014 including on topics such as evolution, interracial marriage and women\u2019s rights. Sotomayor asked if schools must guess at what parents deem a violation of their religious beliefs.\nIn a White House briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said U.S. President Donald Trump \u201cbelieves strongly that parents should have a greater say in their children\u2019s education.\u201d\n\n\nAbout 66% of Maryland voters said it is inappropriate for public school teachers to discuss acceptance of LGBTQ+ people with students in kindergarten to third grade, according to a 2022 survey of 810 voters conducted by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland.\nThe Supreme Court will release its final ruling on the case in June.",

    "summary": "Malik Crozier, a high school football player from Utah, benefits financially from NIL Club, an online service connecting boosters with athletes; however, most states prohibit such collectives to maintain competitive balance and prevent recruiting wars among schools.",
    "content": "Malik Crozier, a 17-year-old football player from Brigham City, Utah, is a member of two teams.\nOne is the football team at Box Elder High School, where Crozier is a wide receiver. Another is NIL Club, a national online service that unites sports boosters and high school athletes around the United States. Last year, Crozier said, he received payments from NIL Club of approximately $100.\nCrozier said he and about thirty teammates have joined NIL Club. He refers to the company as \u201ca fundraiser that your child gets to keep.\u201d\n\u201cThis has definitely helped me with gas and extra school stuff,\u201d he said.\nIn high school sports, getting paid isn\u2019t prohibited for all athletes anymore. In 41 states and Washington, DC, athletic associations permit high school players to be compensated for use of their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL). They can profit from pitching products on social media, posing for selfies at a supermarket grand opening and a lot more.\nIn contrast, most high school associations ban collectives. Collectives pay athletes as NIL deals do but are different in that the money received comes from boosters and family members, among others.\n\n\u201c This has definitely helped me with gas and extra school stuff.\u201d\n\u2014 Malik Crozier, high school football player, Brigham City, Utah\n\nAccording to the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association\u2019s handbook, collectives are \u201cgroups of alumni, boosters, parents or other people that form a corporation, non-profit organization or other entity to facilitate NIL earnings for student-athletes at a specific school.\u201d\nStates including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida have adopted rules to keep collectives out of high school sports. Officials voice concern that wealthy schools will form well-funded clubs and will dominate over teams with less money.\n\u201cCollectives promote recruiting. We don\u2019t want to see that within our schools. We don\u2019t want to jeopardize the competitive nature of our athletics,\u201d Mark E. Byers, Chief Operating Officer of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, told Capital News Service.\n\n\u201cCollectives promote recruiting. We don\u2019t want to see that within our schools.\u201d\n\u2014 Mark E. Byers, Chief Operating Officer of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association\n\nAndrew Warner, Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association athletic director, noted that collectives raise concern for high school sports in part because, \u201cThey violate the separation between individual NIL and student-athlete attachment to schools.\u201d\nIn contrast to high school rules banning them, collectives are an accepted part of college sports and can be a decisive factor in recruitment of top athletes. At three Power Four Conference schools \u2014 the University of Texas, Ohio State University and Louisiana State University \u2014 collectives distributed more than $20 million last year, according to 247sports.com.\nNIL Club doesn\u2019t call itself a collective but operates like one in some basic ways, including the fact that it takes in money from donors and distributes it to athletes. On its website, NIL Club notes that it is different from collectives \u201cas these [NIL Club] communities are run by students, not by adults or boosters.\u201d\nNIL Club unites high school athletes with sports boosters but doesn\u2019t label itself a collective. (Screenshot of NIL Club website)\nCrozier said he discovered the platform over the summer when a friend sent him a link. After joining, athletes like Crozier generate income by creating content such as photos and videos and sharing them to the website. NIL Club, created by a technology company called YOKE, charges a monthly fee for access to the player-generated content which is behind a paywall. Part of the subscription fees goes to players like Crozier.\nHow many high school and college players participate in NIL Club is difficult to determine. The homepage on NIL Club\u2019s website refers to 250,000 \u201cparticipating students.\u201d\nMick Assaf, co-chief executive officer, said that NIL Club\u2019s goal is to be \u201ca helpful partner to the state associations.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe the platform can help high school students and state associations better understand NIL as a whole,\u201d Assaf said in an interview with CNS.\nMore stories: High School Sports & NIL: How dollars are changing the game\nNIL Club\u2019s venture into high school sports has been rocky. Last year, Georgia\u2019s High School Association issued a warning to players that if they signed up with NIL Club \u2013 and were paid by boosters for online content \u2013 they risked losing their sports eligibility, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\nIn 2024, the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association also singled out NIL Club for apparent violations of the state\u2019s NIL policies.\nOn the NIL Club website, some students used labels that included school names and sports. TSAA noted that led to confusion about whether schools were sanctioning NIL activity, according to a report in The Tennessean. NIL Club also permitted students to upload photos wearing school uniforms with logos and the school name. That violated the state\u2019s high school NIL policy about use of school intellectual property.\nAt Box Elder High School in Utah, Crozier believes in NIL Club. In fact, he wishes the company would do more to promote the football team\u2019s presence on its website to fans and family members.\n\u201cThey would probably pledge more because a lot of them played for Box Elder,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Behavioral health screenings, like the BIMAS-2, can help identify students needing mental health support, but they remain uncommon in U.S. schools due to concerns over resource allocation and responsibility.",
    "content": "After Achilles Bardos learned about the internet in the 1990s, he thought to himself, \u201cWhy not in psychology?\u201d\nA school psychology professor, Bardos talked with his colleagues about using the web to quickly collect data on student behavior. A few years later, he and his colleagues created the Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System, or BIMAS.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was identifying kiddos, students, through parents or through teacher ratings and the kids themselves who were able to tell us, \u2018Hey, we are OK, some of us are not as OK and some of us really need lots of supports,\u2019\u201d Bardos said.\u00a0\nThe BIMAS \u2014 now the BIMAS-2 \u2014\u00a0 is one of several behavioral health screenings used in schools throughout the United States. Yet amid a youth mental health crisis that, according to federal statistics, means 40% of high schoolers reported feeling sad or hopeless in 2023, computer-based mental health screenings remain fairly uncommon in America\u2019s public schools.\u00a0\nA 2021 survey found 12.8% of school districts that responded have policies calling for mental health screenings. Another study from that same year found only 5.4% of schools offered behavioral health screenings to all their students.\u00a0\nBardos said no Maryland schools use his company\u2019s screening tool. But other screening tools are in use in the state\u2019s schools, said Sharon Hoover, co-director of the National Center for School Mental Health, which is based at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\u201cHowever, schools also may have concerns about being responsible for universal screening of students because they may then feel responsible for addressing any identified issues,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cOften schools do not have the resources to implement and respond to mental health screening, especially if done without community partnerships.\u201d\nIn some cases, then, schools only use screening tools in particular grades. At the Green Bay Area Public School District in Wisconsin, for example, fifth- and eighth-graders are the only ones screened. Christina Gingle, a school official in Green Bay, said screenings the district uses allow staffers to more quickly identify students in need.\nShe said the BIMAS-2 \u201chas greatly strengthened our ability to be able to support the mental wellness of our students.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s in a screening?\nBardos is now CEO of EduMetrisis, the company that publishes the BIMAS-2, which calls on respondents to fill out a 34-question form. The respondent can either be a teacher, a parent, the student themself or a combination of the three.\nBardos said schools can begin screening students as early as pre-K. The earlier a school implements screenings and follows up with the appropriate interventions, the better the outcome is going to be, he said.\nThe respondent fills out the form online and the responses are immediately collected in a database for school officials to examine. It takes about five minutes to fill out the form, Bardos said.\u00a0\nThe form asks the respondent to rate whether the student has performed a specific behavior in the past week on a five-point scale from never to very often. The questions range from how often the student followed directions to how often they threatened or bullied others.\nAnother question asks students how often they have thought of hurting themselves. Bardos said that question gives the first initial indication that a student needs help.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little opening to a box that says to you, \u2018Please take a look at me,\u2019\u201d he said.\nAnother common behavioral health screening is the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment, or DESSA.\u00a0\nThat screener evaluates students on six different competencies: optimistic thinking, relationship skills, self-management, responsible decision-making, social awareness and self-awareness.\nLike the BIMAS-2, respondents complete the DESSA online. Respondents can be students, teachers or parents. The respondent, like in the BIMAS-2, is asked how often the student performs a certain behavior on a five-point scale from never to almost always.\nSome of the questions include: \u201cDuring the past four weeks, how often did the student keep trying when unsuccessful?\u201d and \u201cDuring the past four weeks, how often did the student believe they can achieve their goals?\u201d\nThe DESSA groups students into three different categories based on how they respond to its questions: strength, typical and need for instruction \u2014 equivalent to above average, average and below average.\nThere are two versions of the DESSA. DESSA-mini is a shorter, eight-question form meant to serve as a benchmark for districts and help them gather information about the entire student body, said Evelyn Johnson, vice president for research at Riverside Insights, the company that publishes the screening tool.\nThe full DESSA assessment, which can evaluate individual students, has 40 questions. Middle and high school students can complete the assessment on their own.\nJust like Bardos\u2019 test, the DESSA can be used with students in grades K-12.\nEquipped with information from the DESSA, \u201cschools can start thinking about: How can I help this student build on the strengths they already are demonstrating to then develop skills in other areas that are going to serve them well?\u201d Johnson said.\nScreenings in schools\nIn its screening guide, the National Center for School Mental Health recommends schools start small when they begin screening students \u2014 and that\u2019s what the Green Bay area schools did.\nThe district is in its second year of implementing the BIMAS-2. Gingle, the district\u2019s associate director of pupil services, said district officials favored a slow rollout to make sure they could address students\u2019 concerns, especially if they mentioned self-harm.\nThe district chose to only screen students in the fifth and eighth grades because those are critical times in their lives \u2014 just before they transition from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school.\nGingle said the district created an intervention guide and conducted trainings for teachers, administrators and parents before implementing the screening tool.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it has been really well-received and [is] hopefully preventing any types of crises and keeping students in really that least restrictive setting to receive the level of needed care,\u201d she said.\nIn Northern Virginia, Alexandria City Public Schools took a more comprehensive approach by screening all students from kindergarten to grade 12.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is identify those life skills students have already learned and things, but also try to enhance ones that might need to be developed as it relates to social emotional competencies,\u201d said Victor Martin, the district\u2019s executive director of student support teams.\nMartin\u2019s district has been using the DESSA for three years. He said the district chose to use that screening tool because it measures social and emotional learning, or the process in which people develop their identities, manage their emotions and create relationships.\nThe district screens students twice a year. Teachers fill out a shorter assessment for students in kindergarten through eighth grade. It takes about two minutes to fill out the form for each student, Martin said.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn high school, students complete a longer assessment on their own. It takes them about 20 minutes to complete, according to Martin.\u00a0\nThe district then compiles the data and uses it to help its student support teams and teachers provide small group instruction, while other students may be referred for individual or online counseling.\n\u201cPerhaps you might see that an entire grade level is maybe struggling with relationship skills, and maybe that\u2019s an opportunity for us, in collaboration with the classroom teacher, to work on providing lessons that might help with building relationship skills,\u201d Martin said.\u00a0\nUsing that approach, some schools in the district have seen entire grade levels improve from the fall assessment to the spring assessment.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen students improve to a strengths-based level because of strategies and interventions that have been put in place by those schools,\u201d Martin said.\nA reluctance to screen\nStudents in Green Bay and Alexandria can opt out of the screenings if their parents prefer \u2014 but elsewhere, many school districts are entirely opting out of behavioral health screenings, or limiting their use, for a number of reasons.\nA 2023 poll published in Phi Delta Kappan found the public has mixed views on mental health assessments in schools. Of those that responded to the survey, 45% said schools should assess students only when their parents or guardians request it, 39% said schools should assess all students and 14% said schools should not assess students.\n\nSometimes school officials worry parents are going to be upset if their children are screened, said Elizabeth Connors, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.\nShe said that worry is often unfounded. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s often that much resistance, but it certainly does happen,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we encourage schools to be reaching out to their parents.\u201d\nYet the screenings have caused a stir in some places. When Wake County schools in North Carolina implemented the BIMAS-2, some parents objected to the idea that teachers would be evaluating the behavioral health of their students.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to put the teachers in the position to have to analyze the students in this way,\u201d Rachael Ayscue, the parent of a high schooler, told ABC11 in Raleigh-Durham in 2019. \u201cThey\u2019re educated in the curriculum that they\u2019re teaching, not in behavioral science.\u201d\nStudents sometimes object to the screenings, too. In 2022, Isaiah Steinberg, at the time a student at Jamesville-Dewitt High School in upstate New York, wrote an essay criticizing the BIMAS-2 in the school newspaper, the RamPage. He said students were reluctant to complete the screening, and for a good reason.\n\u201cThe truth is that J-D students are nervous that they will be singled out by their counselors and administrators, people who they often do not know or trust very well,\u201d Steinberg wrote.\nAnother potential limitation of mental health screenings is the cost. For example, it would cost a school district the size of Green Bay over $70,000 each year to use the BIMAS-2.\nSigns of success\nThere\u2019s evidence, though, that the screenings do some good.\nA March 2025 study by University of Nebraska researchers found the BIMAS-2 \u201ceffectively identifies at-risk students, offering an effective approach to addressing adolescent mental health needs in rural communities.\u201d\nAnd a 2017 study of low-income kindergarteners evaluated with the DESSA found the screening accurately evaluated their self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making.\nBoth Gingle and Martin mentioned screenings are just one data point they look at when they consider a child\u2019s mental well-being.\nMartin said Alexandria schools wouldn\u2019t automatically put a child into therapy based on the results of the screening. \u201cWe would take that in consideration with attendance and grades and disciplinary reasons and concerns from the teacher,\u201d he said.\nConnors said that\u2019s the right approach. She likens mental health screenings to vision screenings in schools.\u00a0\n\u201cJust because you, you know, fail that vision screening, it doesn\u2019t mean that you need glasses. You actually need to go to the optometrist, and they\u2019re going to have sharper tools there,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA lower score on the screening just means that school officials should follow up with those students and understand whether the student would benefit from some kind of service, she added.\u00a0\nDespite the occasional concerns of parents and students elsewhere, Gingle and Martin said the response from parents to the screenings in their schools has been positive. Both said their districts have made sure to do outreach to parents to make sure they understand the screenings and how they are conducted.\nConnors said when school districts start doing mental health screenings, they begin to understand their students have a lot of mental health needs that, without screenings, may have gone unnoticed.\u00a0\n\u201cOnce you identify one student who otherwise might have fallen through the cracks, you realize how essential this is to supporting student mental health and well-being and success,\u201d Connors said.\nClarification: An earlier version of this story said DESSA had 72 questions, but that was for the assessment\u2019s previous version. The updated version of DESSA includes 40 questions, and the story has been edited to reflect that fact.",

Instead, the school\u2019s \u201cplayground\u201d is a vast expanse of barren blacktop with just a lone basketball hoop.\nYet at this aging two-story elementary school in this deeply diverse Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood, play is not just encouraged, but deeply embedded in the school\u2019s culture.\u00a0\nFor the past six years, Rhawnhurst has partnered with Playworks, a national nonprofit dedicated to enhancing children\u2019s well-being by engaging them in safe, meaningful play.

During the 2023-24 school year, the organization was active in more than 1,300 schools, and thanks to a $295,000 state grant, Playworks is now active in Maryland, in Anne Arundel County elementary schools.\nThe Playworks approach seems to work, both nationally and at Rhawnhurst.\nAt schools implementing Playworks, teacher-reported rates of bullying and exclusionary behavior were 43% lower compared to schools not using the program, according to an evaluation\u00a0 by Mathematica Policy Research and the John W. Gardner Center in 2013. And a 2017 Rand Corp. review found that Playworks boosted student behavior, class readiness and safety while cutting down on bullying.\nAt Rhawnhurst, \u201conce Playworks started, there was so much less fighting and arguing, and they were actually playing games that they enjoyed to play and it kept them busy,\u201d said Michelle Bernardi, a fifth grade teacher at the school. \u201cIt was just a wonderful difference.\u201d\nGame Time\u00a0\nRhawnhurst\u2019s recess may look like typical elementary school chaos \u2014 with kids running, shouting and playing \u2014 but underneath the noise is structure. Students know the expectations, and they\u2019re given clear choices: a variety of games to join if they so choose.\u00a0\nAt the start of each 20-minute recess, students line up in single file and listen closely for their \u201crepeat after me\u201d instructions, a set of expectations focused on playing safely, including others and showing respect on the blacktop.\u00a0\nRecess staff or older student mentors then present the games they will be running that day, whether it\u2019s monkey in the middle, soccer or something new.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open recess with more options,\u201d said Sean Finn, the school\u2019s guidance counselor.\u00a0\nThird graders at Rhawnhurst School play \u201chuman knot\u201d during recess. (Christina Walker/Capital News Service)\nPlayworks also introduced Class Game Time into the school day. During her two weeks on site, Saunders pulls nearly every class, along with their teachers, outside for 35 minutes to learn a new game.\u00a0\n\u201cInstead of the teachers sitting off to the side on their phones, on their computer doing work, they\u2019re involved directly in the games,\u201d Finn said. \u201cThey\u2019re running and playing and jumping through hula hoops and racing.\u201d\nThat approach strengthens relationships among teachers and students, Bernardi said.\n\u201c[During class games] you can just talk to them on a different level,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might bring up something that you wouldn\u2019t have a chance to talk with them about in class.\u201d\nAll the play at Rhawnhurst also depends on \u201cclimate staff:\u201d employees who manage students\u2019 lunch periods and recess, giving teachers a break. These staffers also often step in as teacher aides and handle conflicts.\n\u201cThe staff have bought in,\u201d Rhawnhurst principal\u00a0 Joy Kingwood-Ellis said. \u201cClimate staff really need to be developed, and they want to be treated like professionals, and I think Playworks really gives them a template to work from.\u201d\nThe Playworks approach includes conflict resolution tools for students, which are important because many student spats tend to arise in the recess yard, Mathisen said.\nBut staffers said kids are increasingly able to manage their own disagreements.\nRoshambo, or more commonly known as rock-paper-scissors, is Playworks\u2019 \u2014 and now Rhawnhurst\u2019s \u2014 preferred way to settle an argument. It may sound simple, but the staff at Rhawnhurst said the students view it as fair and use it often with or without adult intervention.\n\u201cWe work with kids to help give them agency on, \u2018what does it look like when there is a conflict? How do you resolve that?\u2019\u201d Mathisen said.\u00a0\u00a0\nFewer conflicts\u00a0\nSince introducing Playworks, Rhawnhurst has seen a transformation in school climate, marked by fewer conflicts and almost no bullying, according to teachers and staff. Kingwood-Ellis said she hasn\u2019t suspended a student in years.\n\u201cThis office has seen drastically less incidents of conflicts,\u201d Finn said. \u201cWe got it out of our system [during recess], we were able to connect with friends, you know, connect with an adult, and get whatever we need kind of out of our system and reset ourselves.\u201d \nBut Rhawnhurst, an elementary school with more than 600 students, is not a typical Playworks school.\u00a0\nRhawnhurst has partnered with Playworks for more than six years, and a Playworks staff member is on-site for 40 hours per month. Typically, Playworks aims to make its program sustainable and self-sufficient, often staying for a few years until the school can maintain the practices independently.\u00a0\nThis has not yet happened at Rhawnhurst, which hosts a large number of immigrant and refugee students. More than 27 languages can be heard in the school\u2019s hallways, but Playworks officials said their program helps break down those language barriers.\u00a0\n\u201c[Rhawnhurst] just loves us,\u201d Mathisen said. \u201cBecause of the different languages that they have, they are a unique case, and they can see truly the benefit of how play really has infused with their school and how kids are able to connect and really make progress and friends so much faster despite the language barriers.\u201d\u00a0\nFinn noted the program has also contributed to improved attendance, as students are eager to participate in recess and class game time.\nElsewhere, many teachers struggle to manage behavior in the classroom. A 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 68% of elementary school teachers report dealing with behavior issues daily. The same percentage indicated they have experienced verbal abuse from students, while 55% have encountered physical violence.\nBut things are different at Rhawnhurst.\nFinn said thanks to Playworks, students with trauma or behavioral challenges often become better at self-regulating and managing their emotions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe want to continue that relationship [with Playworks], because we\u2019re always evolving with our immigrant and refugee population, but we\u2019re also evolving as professional educators here,\u201d Finn said. \u201cIt\u2019s invaluable to our school climate.\u201d \n\u2018Junior coaches\u2019\u00a0\nFor some of Rhawnhurst\u2019s students, recess isn\u2019t just playtime \u2014 it\u2019s a job.\nOut on the schoolyard, you can find a select group of fourth and fifth graders leading the younger students during recess, sometimes wearing their official purple Playworks T-shirts and blowing their whistles. They raise their voices to announce which games are available that day, take charge of the activities and ensure the games run smoothly while adults focus on safety.\nThese fourth and fifth graders are part of the Junior Coaches Program, where they take on shifts throughout the week to help guide recess for kindergarten through second grade. In the process, they build leadership skills and confidence that extend far beyond the playground.\n\u201cWe can inspire kids and we can prove that we\u2019re responsible,\u201d said Rayanne Musa, a fourth-grade student in the program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nJunior Coach Gracious Gray, a fifth grader at Rhawnhurst School, leads a game of Monkey in the Middle during recess for the younger grades. (Christina Walker/Capital News Service)\nFinn oversees the 18 junior coaches at Rhawnhurst.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real social-emotional component to having them grow as leaders, practicing being assertive and not aggressive on the playground or not passive on the playground, collaborating, cooperating with each other,\u201d Finn said. \u201cThese are our future leaders.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile the junior coaches lead many of the recess games, Saunders can focus on identifying students who don\u2019t have anyone to play with or those who want to try a different game than what was originally offered.\u00a0\nLeen Tay, a fourth-grade junior coach at Rhawnhurst, said having students like her out on the playground is especially important for the younger kids. Coaches are more than role models; they can also be friends who feel more approachable and trustworthy than adults.\n\u201cWhen we play with them \u2026 they feel like they have someone they can trust,\u201d Tay said. \u201cWhen I play with them I understand how they feel.\u201d\n\u2018An important time\u2019\nWhile Playworks has had a noticeable impact at Rhawnhurst, even its supporters acknowledge it may face challenges at other schools.\u00a0\nFor one thing, Playworks isn\u2019t free. The organization said establishing its Playworks coach service typically costs between $60,000 and $65,000 per school, although schools with more than half their students on free or reduced-price lunches are eligible for a subsidy that pays up to 50% of the costs.\nIn schools without climate staff, implementing Playworks could be more difficult. That\u2019s because in such schools, Playworks puts more pressure on teachers to participate in training and recess, all on top of their existing responsibilities.\n\u201c[Having climate staff] builds more support and more community,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIf you\u2019re putting so much on a teacher, they\u2019re not giving 100% in the places that matter.\u201d\nHowever, many schools across the nation with Playworks do not have climate staff.\u00a0\n\u201cPlayworks works best with any school that has full buy-in,\u201d Mathisen said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a teacher or school aid or climate staff.\u201d\u00a0\nIn addition, not everyone agrees on how structured play should be. A 2020 study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found \u201cunstructured play in addition to mindfulness intervention is effective in promoting students\u2019 happiness and playfulness, both of which may help maintain mental health and well-being.\u201d However, that study also noted unstructured play led to increased disruptive behavior.\n\u201cThere are people who really feel like play should be kind of free from adults and rules,\u201d said Geetha Ramani, a human development professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s College of Education. \u201cI take a little bit of a \u2026 different feel about that, because I think that you can have sort of structured or guided play and have it be really rewarding and meaningful to the kids and still be an opportunity for it to be playful.\u201d\nRamani stressed recess gives children time to refocus and prepare for the classroom.\n\u201c[Recess is] a really important time,\u201d Ramani said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing recess time often kind of being decreased, but it\u2019s really important to maintain that time, otherwise it\u2019s going to be hard for children to sort of stay focused for long periods of time.\u201d\u00a0\nTargeting play is potentially a piece of the solution to the nation\u2019s growing behavioral problems in elementary schools, the professor said.\u00a0\n\u201cPlay becomes really important, both kind of free and structured play,\u201d Ramani said. \u201cSo \u2026 [students] have opportunities to learn in ways that may be more age-appropriate, and so I think, you know, targeting play as a potential way to help is important.\u201d\nGracious Gray, fifth grader and junior coach at Rhawnhurst, said the program lets her feel like a big sister and brings back memories of her own younger days.\u00a0\nShe said for some of the younger students, the extra support Playworks provides on the playground can make all the difference.\n\u201cThere\u2019s kids that don\u2019t really have anyone to play with. \u2026 I can step in and play with them and make them feel wanted,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to influence little ones so they could be like us one day and be kind people.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's high school graduation rate reached 88% in 2024, a significant increase of nearly 2 percentage points from the previous year, with notable gains among Hispanic students and multilingual learners. Anne Arundel County Public Schools reported a 1% jump to an 89% graduation rate, attributing success to targeted support initiatives like Project Graduation.",
    "content": "Listen to this story:\n\nMaryland\u2019s high school graduation rate climbed to 88% in 2024, reaching its highest point since 2017, according to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). The increase of nearly 2 percentage points over the previous year marks a significant recovery following pandemic-era declines.\nThe 2024 data from MSDE shows significant gains among student groups that have historically faced barriers to graduation. Hispanic students saw their graduation rate rise over seven percentage points from 2023-2024, while multilingual learners experienced a dramatic increase of over 10%.\n\u201cLast year was the largest year-over-year gain of any student group, and I think that\u2019s a testimony to targeted, sustained supports that are making the difference,\u201d said Theresa Timmons Parrott, an MSDE official focused on multilingual education. \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction, but it\u2019s not the finish line.\u201d\n\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools reported a graduation rate of 89%, two percentage points above the state average. North County High School in Glen Burnie, a Title I school, achieved a 7% increase in its graduation rate.\nBob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, said \u201cevery student group is different, and so it\u2019s providing students with what it is that they need on an individual basis to be successful.\u201d\n\u201cA nearly full-point jump in overall graduation rate is a very significant accomplishment,\u201d said Mosier. \u201cWe also had six schools that increased by two percentage points or more.\u201d\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\nMosier credited the district\u2019s progress in part to Project Graduation, a systemwide initiative launched two years ago to provide tailored support to students at risk of not finishing high school on time.\n\u201cIt really is a laser-like focus on individual students and what those students need in order to graduate, graduate on time,\u201d Mosier said about the project. \u201cWe put that in place two years ago, \u2026 and we\u2019re starting to see that pay off now.\u201d\nIn Baltimore City, the four-year graduation rate rose by one percentage point for the 2023 graduating class. MSDE said the district focused on ninth-grade intervention and reducing chronic absenteeism, two predictors of long-term academic success. According to MSDE\u2019s public dataset, Baltimore also saw improved outcomes among English language learners and students experiencing homelessness.\nStatewide, female students continued to graduate at higher rates than male students, and white and Asian students graduated at higher rates than their Black and Hispanic peers. Students with disabilities graduated at a rate of 69%, still well below the statewide average. Economically disadvantaged students\u2019 graduation rate increased slightly from 2023, graduating at a rate of 82%.\nThe graduation rate report comes as Maryland begins to implement the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, a landmark education reform law that aims to expand early childhood education, increase college and career readiness and close equity gaps. Several of the strategies outlined in the Blueprint \u2014 including community school models and increased funding for English language learners \u2014 align with areas of progress highlighted in the 2024 data.\n\u201cIf you dig down into the Blueprint, it really lays the foundation for the strategies we\u2019re seeing pay off,\u201d Parrott said. She attributes a large portion of the progress made to broaden access to early childhood education, target funding for multilingual learners, and mandate college and career readiness pathways by tenth grade.\nWhile the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future has driven recent graduation gains, lawmakers enacted adjustments this year due to a projected $3 billion budget shortfall. The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, passed in April 2025, includes a three-year delay in implementing teacher collaborative time and provisions to freeze increases in funding if state revenues significantly decline.\u200b\nStill, regional disparities persist. While some districts reported graduation rates above 90%, others, particularly in rural counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, sit at 80% and below. Education advocates say these gaps underscore the need for continued investment and monitoring.\n\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\u201cThis is great news for Maryland,\u201d State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright said in a press release from MSDE. \u201cWhen we set high standards, deliver strong instruction, and invest in proven supports, our students show that they will exceed expectations.\u201d\nAs the 2025 graduating class enters its final year, educators and policymakers are cautiously optimistic. The latest data suggests that Maryland\u2019s post-pandemic recovery is underway, however state education officials say it will require long-term commitment to equity, funding and student support services to maintain.",

    "summary": "Maryland's youth mental health initiatives will receive $70 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget, up from the initially proposed $40 million, bringing the total to nearly $98 million with leftover funds. This funding ensures continued support for mental health services in over 80% of Maryland public schools, according to advocates.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland mental health advocates and providers are relieved coming out of this year\u2019s legislative session, where state lawmakers decided against a drastic cut in funding to the state\u2019s year-old, big-money program aimed at improving the mental health of its young people.\nThe Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, created under the state\u2019s ambitious and expensive education reform plan called the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, will receive $70 million from the state\u2019s fiscal year 2026 budget to award mental health providers in its second round of grants. That\u2019s up from the $40 million Gov. Wes Moore originally suggested spending.\u00a0\nBut with some money left over from funding this past fiscal year, the consortium plans to allocate closer to $98 million in grants. Legislators previously allocated $119.7 million over two years to set up the consortium and issued its first $111 million of grants in February 2024.\nPartly as a result of those grants, more than 80% of Maryland public schools now have some sort of mental health service available for students. And mental health advocates said the additional funding means the state\u2019s effort will continue to reach a large percentage of the state\u2019s children.\n\u201cThis is a critical investment that\u2019s ensuring students in every corner of our state have the resources and support necessary to learn and thrive,\u201d said Dan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\nThe consortium provides mental health funding for dozens of services, including in-school counseling, substance abuse treatment and peer support groups for families and students.\u00a0\nBut at the beginning of this year\u2019s difficult legislative session where the General Assembly would have to fill a $3 billion budget hole, Moore proposed a spending plan that allocated only $40 million to the youth mental health effort \u2014 even though he once proposed the program should receive $130 million for fiscal year 2026.\u00a0\nThe General Assembly, however, passed a bill on the last day of the legislative session that added $30 million to the youth mental health budget on top of what Moore had proposed, leaving many relieved for the future of the program.\u00a0\nSen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat representing Montgomery and Howard counties, said this decision was crucial for the future of the consortium and the youth mental health programs it funds.\n\u201cI think when you\u2019re trying to address the mental health needs of the entire state, you can\u2019t really do it piecemeal,\u201d Hester said. \nIf funding for the consortium had been limited to the amount suggested in Moore\u2019s budget, \u201cyou would have to redo the entire program,\u201d Hester added.\nThe consortium\u2019s grant allocations are designed around a \u201chub and spoke\u201d model that aims to include community organizations in the program. The hubs, or organizations already established in Maryland\u2019s counties, including churches and community centers, help promote and run the services of the spokes, or mental health programs. Both are funded through consortium grants.\n\u201cThe hub and spoke model would not have worked at $40 million,\u201d Hester said.\nWhile the community organizations are in different stages of operation in each county, Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, said the funding provided will allow for the program to move closer to full implementation this upcoming year.\nLuckner said a good number of active service providers have applied for the second round of funding, which the consortium is expected to issue by June 30.\u00a0\nThe initial 127 grants were projected to serve about 150,000 people, \u201cand they\u2019re well on their way to do that globally,\u201d Luckner said at Thursday\u2019s consortium meeting.\u00a0\nLuckner said he believes within two years, as many as 22 of the state\u2019s 24 jurisdictions will either have a fully operational or almost fully operational youth mental health hub.\n\u201cWe should just take a moment and celebrate that accomplishment that the consortium is achieving,\u201d Luckner said. \nService providers agree. Jan Guszynski is the project manager for Prosper, an app that, under Uneo Health, provides mental health check ins-for adolescents. The app received $1.4 million grants to provide services in Prince George\u2019s, Frederick and Calvert counties.\u00a0\u00a0\nBefore the legislation was passed confirming $70 million in consortium funding for fiscal year 2026, Guszynski said she was worried for the future of not only mental health services but for the students using them.\n\u201cI really, really hope that we do not see these resources shuttered or too heavily impacted as time goes on,\u201d Guszynski said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s hugely important.\u201d\nThose resources won\u2019t likely get shuttered or too heavily impacted if the General Assembly sticks with the outline it set in the budget it just passed, which projects $100 million in youth mental health funding in fiscal year 2027 and $100 million annually after that.",

He\u2019s working in a public high school, offering what he calls \u201cbig brother love\u201d to his students.\u00a0\nSmith, who started work at Bard High School Early College DC in Southeast Washington last fall while completing his degree, said he\u2019s now doing the same \u201cnoble\u201d work that his mother did: serving as a school social worker.\nAnd thanks to a Howard program that aims to place social work students in schools in hopes that they\u2019ll work there full-time when they graduate, others are doing similar work. In the program\u2019s first two years, 22 second-year master\u2019s students have been placed in schools in the nation\u2019s capital to increase and diversify the school social work labor force, especially where they are needed the most.\nIt\u2019s called Project PRESS, which stands for Preparing Responsive and Effective School Social Workers. And the pilot program addresses a pressing need: a shortage of social workers in schools both in D.C. and nationwide.\u00a0\nWhen Project PRESS started in 2023, there were 95 school social worker vacancies in D.C. public schools, said Sandra Jeter, an assistant professor of social work at Howard, at a panel about the project in December. And according to the School Social Work Association of America, no state in the union meets the recommended benchmark of one social worker for every 250 students.\nJeter, who launched Project PRESS with a five-year, $2.6 million federal grant, said social work programs at other universities could establish similar efforts to address the nationwide shortage of school social workers.\u00a0\n\u201cI think PRESS can definitely be a model or just be an organization that offers this training to different universities that are developing social workers, whether they have a school social work focus or not,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cI think any university can adopt this model or work with me on expanding the model.\u201d\u00a0\nIntensive training\nProject PRESS aims to motivate social work students to do something many of their predecessors have decided not to do: work in schools.\n\u201cThe Project PRESS program is a really exciting thing to see to get students excited about the school social work profession,\u201d said Allie Perez, a representative of the School Social Work Association of D.C.\u00a0\nThis yearlong program puts Howard social work students through two weeks of intensive training before they are placed at one of 11 participating schools. Students in the program receive a $10,000 stipend to ease some of the financial stresses of placement in a city school.\u00a0\nSocial workers have different responsibilities than counselors and school psychologists. School social workers tend to work with specific students for long periods of time and create treatment or action plans.\n\u201cWe do the mental health support, but we also take a more systemic view and we really focus on connecting people to resources and helping them remove barriers to those resources,\u201d Perez said.\nSchool counselors are more likely to focus on academic and career development compared to school social workers that are helping students with socio-emotional challenges.\u00a0\nA school psychologist has the ability to diagnose students and perform psychosocial assessments, Jeter said.\u00a0\nThe services that a school social worker provides, especially to underserved students, have a trickle-down effect on how a student performs, said Gloria Cain, an assistant professor at Howard\u2019s School of Social Work and a faculty member with Project PRESS.\u00a0\n\u201cSocial work is a discipline that really focuses on individuals within the context of their environment,\u201d Cain said.\u00a0\nThe need\u00a0\nProject PRESS focuses on sending students to D.C.\u2019s Wards 7 and 8, historically Black and low-income areas located south of the Anacostia River.\nJeter said she believes these areas not only lack investment from the city but lack support rooted in the Black perspective that focuses on issues and trauma people often experience in majority Black and low-income communities.\u00a0\nThe program focuses on culturally responsive training, which prepares program participants to engage with different student populations. It also teaches trauma-informed training, which promotes awareness of the systemic and individual trauma students carry with them so the student is not retraumatized.\u00a0\nRacist incidents, poverty, food insecurity and homelessness are just some of the traumas students can carry with them that impact their performance in school. A main goal of the program is to interrupt these factors and use education as a gateway to success, Cain said.\nKyaus Washington, a 2024 graduate of Howard\u2019s master of social work program, said it\u2019s important for social workers to know when students have experienced such traumas.\n\u201cTraumatic events happen to people and whenever you kind of understand that and try to understand from the person\u2019s perspective, then you\u2019re able to kind of tailor your modality to be effective based on the traumatic experience,\u201d Washington said.\u00a0\nWashington works as a school-based expansion clinician at Lorraine H. Whitlock Elementary School in Ward 7. He noted negative experiences with therapists and the nation\u2019s long history of medical racism can lead to a sense of relief when a young Black student sees a Black social worker.\n\u201cPeople automatically have this shared sense of community with each other,\u201d Washington said. \u201cIf they see, you know, me, a Black man walking into the school, my Black male students could automatically connect with me from that one shared identity.\u201d\u00a0\nMore from Youth mental health: What works?\nContinued barriers\nWashington keeps fidget toys and Play-Doh in his office to create a safe and fun place for students to come as a reward for good behavior.\n\u201cStudents tend to like to come to my office because other people in the building are relatively hard on them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like that safe space where you can always come in here and hang.\u201d\u00a0\nWashington is among the 60% of program participants that were hired in D.C. public schools after their participation in Project PRESS. Many other students are looking to apply in schools but are facing issues with licensure, a barrier reflected across the country for Black social work students.\u00a0\nA 2022 report from the Association of Social Work Boards reported a 45% pass rate of the licensing exam for Black participants compared to 84% of white participants.\u00a0 Jeter said Project PRESS hopes to address this licensure gap through a prep course taught by Washington, along with other resources provided to students.\u00a0\nSocial work students in Project PRESS are required to work at least 20 hours per week at their placement on top of their graduate coursework. Washington and Smith said this workload was manageable, but mentioned other students in their program felt burnout from the work.\u00a0\nIn their\u00a0 students\u2019 training weeks, they were taught mindfulness exercises and yoga to find ways to relax and have been offered other resources of support.\u00a0\nWhile at their placements, program participants are able to complete case consultations with school students, parents and teachers to address the broader issues impacting a student\u2019s performance. They also act as sources of support for students in their caseload. Smith has helped his students find jobs or add others to his caseload if they regularly come to his office.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you consistently show up for them and invest in them truly, I feel like we\u2019re going to really reap the benefits of all that as a society,\u201d Smith said.\u00a0\nProject PRESS solely focuses on master\u2019s degree students who are interested in school social work. Jeter only selects second-year graduate students for this program as she said they know where they want to be.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just go there and get this experience and leave. It\u2019s important for us to become a part of the community,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cOur students should become a part of the community even after they graduate.\u201d\nWhile Smith entered the master\u2019s program unsure of becoming a school social worker, he is now planning on working in D.C. public schools after he graduates.\u00a0\nHe sees the pipeline between Howard and D.C. public schools as necessary to give students the services that they need.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much negative stuff, like spewing the news and stuff like that, about what was going on with the youth and everything, but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of people who\u2019ve been willing to offer solutions and be action-oriented,\u201d Smith said.\u00a0\nNext steps\nOne major roadblock could stand in the way of Project PRESS, however: the Trump administration\u2019s ban on funding for programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.\nJeter said she hasn\u2019t heard anything about the program\u2019s federal grant being suspended. And while a federal lawsuit has temporarily put the DEI ban on hold, she remains worried.\n\u201cIf funding cuts continue, we will have even fewer resources for vulnerable and marginalized populations, less supportive programs like Project PRESS that aim to support students pursuing careers in the helping profession like social work and education, and more strain on an already overwhelmed social services system,\u201d Jeter said.\u00a0\nSandra Jeter, an assistant professor at Howard University\u2019s School of Social Work and the creator of Project PRESS, poses for a portrait. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nFaculty and students alike hope for the continuation of this program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cFor you to have something stable and consistent structured, it kind of puts your mind at peace when you have all this other school stuff to worry about,\u201d Smith said.\u00a0\nA survey completed by the first-year cohort revealed 100% of respondents reported the training effectively prepared them for the hiring process and their work in schools, Jeter said. She said she believes this is a clear demonstration of how the program is accomplishing one of its goals: supporting students.\u00a0\nAnother goal of Project PRESS is to see if the work students are doing in their placements is having a trickle-down effect on issues like tardiness or school suspensions, Cain said.\u00a0\nThis program is close to Jeter\u2019s heart, not only for her attachment to D.C. public schools but for what the program can mean for future generations.\u00a0\n\u201cMy nephews and nieces are being educated in D.C. schools now, and so I know when I was younger and experienced anxiety and depression I didn\u2019t have a social worker,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m a part of the process to get at least my niece and nephew support if they would ever need it.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Under the scorching sun and dressed in her corporate blouse and skirt, Sarah Newman sat on the stairs leading up to the Department of Education\u2019s\u00a0entrance.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong by spending time at the place I otherwise would have been at on a Wednesday,\u2019\u2019 Newman said. A green work bag containing books and an office laptop stood beside her.\nThe department closed its headquarters building in Washington as well as regional offices on Wednesday, but Newman sat on the stairs from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. to protest her job loss.\u00a0\nNewman, who lives in northern Virginia and worked with the department for 13 years, was part of staff that faced layoffs on Tuesday that impacted nearly a half of the department\u2019s workforce \u2014 a reduction from 4,133 to 2,183 workers, according to the agency\u2019s website.\u00a0\nNewman worked with the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education under the department. Her work entailed administering grant programs to support students from pre-K to 12th grade, and collecting and analyzing data on student performance, testing and graduation rates to ensure the grant programs\u2019 effectiveness.\u00a0\nNewman said \u201cit feels unjust\u201d losing her job, but while she worries about her future and braces herself for the start of her administrative leave on March 21, she is most fearful of the impacts the staff reduction will have on students.\n\u201cI worry about the persistent kind of inequality that we continue to see,\u201d Newman said. \u201cKids aren\u2019t getting the same experience as one another and I really worry that it will get significantly worse.\u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Two women stand outside of the Department of Education on Wednesday, protesting cuts made to that agency\u2019s workforce. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nThe department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights also faced layoffs on Tuesday, eliminating the entire investigative staff in seven of its 12 regional branches. The civil rights branch is responsible for ensuring equal access to education, prohibiting discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal funds and investigating civil rights violations in schools across the nation.\nThe Department of Education\u2019s other functions include managing federal loans for college, distributing Pell grants, supporting programs for students with disabilities, providing funding to high-poverty schools and supporting students and schools affected by natural disasters.\n\u201cThe Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency\u2019s purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students and competitive grantmaking,\u201d according to a statement from the agency.\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon, nominated by President Donald Trump, said in a statement that the staff reduction \u201creflects the Department of Education\u2019s commitment to efficiency, accountability and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents and teachers.\u201d\u00a0\nBut Joe Murphy, who was let go on Tuesday after working at the department for 10 years, said the firing of workers will have a noticeable impact.\n\u201cI\u2019m very afraid that with the elimination of all of the people within these offices in the department, the delivery of the resources to the grantees, those being the states, is going to be delayed or cut off completely,\u201d he told Capital News Service. \u201cIf they (the Trump administration) can\u2019t get the grants out at all, and if it\u2019s their goal to save money and stop these grants, that\u2019s against what is written into law by Congress.\u201d\nMurphy, from Dumfries, Virginia, worked as a management and data analyst and carried out duties similar to Newman\u2019s. He said working with the department was rewarding. He reminisced about the time he worked on a project that gave grants to Native American students.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was unbelievably gratifying,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBecause we took a population that is frequently underserved in terms of resources, and it gave us a way of proving that they need more resources.\u201d\nMembers of the public dropped by the department\u2019s building Wednesday to express their dismay about the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\nPeople posted signs around the department\u2019s granite garden bed that read \u201cDepartment of Education is not a \u2018Bureaucratic Bloat,\u2019\u201d referencing a statement McMahon made Tuesday on Fox News. Other posters read, \u201cEmployers want to hire an educated workforce,\u201d \u201cYou did NOT keep \u2018all the right people\u2019 \u2026 You kept Elon!\u201d\nLesley Fera, who previously worked as a substitute teacher, flew from Los Angeles to Washington to protest against the downsizing of various federal agencies under Trump and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Fera said she wanted to show solidarity with workers from the department.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how this does not affect education and accessibility to education when people are relying on the public school system,\u201d said Fera, who wore a red shirt that read: \u201cStop the billionaire coup.\u201d\n\u201cMy heart is with education and the programs that will be decimated because of this,\u201d she said.\nKaren Sandoe, a retired teacher who taught in southwest Virginia for 30 years and comes from a family of four generations of educators, sat beside a poster she made that said: \u201c(Re) Tired teacher supporting Dept. of Ed.\u201d\n\u201cWhen history reflects on this, and it will,\u201d Sandoe said, \u201cI want my grandchildren to know that their grandmother stood up for education and for their future.\u201d\u00a0\nNewman, still sitting on the stairs, sipped from a cup of coffee to get her through the day.\n\u201cThis place has been my home away from home,\u201d Newman said about the Education Department. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve created this life for myself, and I\u2019m proud of that.

    "content": "POCOMOKE CITY, Md. \u2014 Worcester County\u2019s Pocomoke High School opened its doors as usual to 352 students on a bright but chilly Thursday last December. A mix of mellow pop hits played in the background, and students at the school made their way to their first-period class welcomed by staffers with smiles and hellos.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe scene in this small town in the southernmost part of Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore clashed with the image of a modern high school rife with rifts and cliques. That\u2019s because the school welcomes all students and treats them with respect, Pocomoke senior Josie Stevens said.\u00a0\n\u201cEvery day I get to come in and everyone\u2019s already in a good mood,\u201d said Stevens, who is active in the school\u2019s Marine Corps Junior ROTC program.\nFor Principal Jenifer Rayne, this positive environment is a result of the school\u2019s adoption of \u201crestorative practices,\u201d a social science technique that downplays traditional discipline methods such as suspensions in favor of building meaningful relationships among students and teachers.\u00a0\nPocomoke High School Principal Jenifer Rayne. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nIn Worcester County, restorative practices appear to be working. District officials credit restorative practices with creating an atmosphere that led to a 28% drop in violent incidents across all schools in the past year.\nWith a majority-minority population and 70% of the student body listed as economically disadvantaged by U.S. News & World Reports, Pocomoke High School is breaking all academic odds. The school is currently tied for the highest graduation rate in Maryland, according to U.S. News & World Report rankings. The class of 2024 achieved a 100% graduation rate.\nRayne attributed the school\u2019s success to its collaborative culture.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to feel like we have to protect ourselves here,\u201d Rayne said. \u201cWe feel accepted, and there is a community-wide goal, including the students, to make sure that our school stays a safe place.\u201d\nBackground and beginnings\nRestorative practices are based on the principle that conflict impacts the school community as a whole, so it must be resolved by community-building measures.\u00a0\nFormer Pocomoke High School Principal Annette Wallace led the integration of restorative measures into the school between 2012 and 2018.\u00a0\nAll schools in the county have since implemented restorative practices, with many ramping up their effort in the past two years. The recent ramp-up included dozens of professional development days in the summer of 2023 for faculty and staff, who then introduced \u201ccommunity-building circles\u201d where students and teachers can discuss issues within each school.\u00a0\nThe transition shifted the focus on discipline to a more situational approach, where troubled students are encouraged to talk their way through problems and repair what was harmed, whether it is another student\u2019s feelings or a physical object.\nThe new approach appears to have created a calmer atmosphere in the county\u2019s schools. During the 2022-23 school year, 432 violent incidents were reported in the district \u2014 while in 2023-24, there were only 285, according to Wallace, who now serves as chief safety and academic officer for grades 9-12 at Worcester County Public Schools.\u00a0\nThere hasn\u2019t been a single fight reported in the fall semester at Pocomoke High School, according to Rayne.\u00a0\u00a0\nPocomoke High School was not the same place a decade ago. Wallace said the hallways were full of conflicts, and a student even punched a teacher in the face in 2010.\nRasheeda Collier, who graduated in 2009 and is now a restorative practices administrator at Pocomoke, laughed when asked how the school environment could have changed if these practices had been implemented when she attended the school. Collier recalled a different method of conflict resolution.\nSuspension rates were high, and students weren\u2019t given the chance to explain their actions or discuss their deeper-rooted issues leading to misbehavior.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a different time,\u201d Collier said. \u201cThey felt like suspension was more effective in punishment \u2014 versus now, we\u2019re looking at research and we\u2019re looking at data and we\u2019re looking at the outcomes. Suspension is not effective for children. Restoring, rebuilding, repairing, promoting empathy, compassion \u2014 that\u2019s a more effective purpose than suspension.\u201d\nConflict and consequences\nCollier now runs the LIFT \u2014 Learning Interventions for Transformation \u2014 classroom, where students who misbehave are referred. There, they discuss what they did wrong and how to move past it.\nSuspensions are now rare at Pocomoke High School. Instead, students work with Collier in the LIFT classroom to discuss why they acted a certain way.\u00a0\nStudents also set goals to help them break their pattern of negative behavior, Rayne said. These strategies can include self-regulation or self-control. Students check in with Collier for a period of time depending on the severity of their actions, and keeping those students in class is a priority.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing hardcore punishment,\u201d Collier said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a rebuilding process with them, which is important because [students] feel safe.\u201d\nRasheeda Collier, Pocomoke High School\u2019s restorative practices administrator, poses for a portrait while holding a note a student had written to her. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nCollier said these practices appear to prevent students from making the same mistakes twice. Pocomoke had 50% fewer students with multiple referrals for bad behavior from September through December than it did in the same period a year earlier, Rayne said.\u00a0\n\u201cOur students are still able to learn, and they\u2019re actually able to grow in the area of social-emotional strategies,\u201d Rayne said.\u00a0\nThe school also offers conflict resolution circles \u2014 or restorative conferences \u2014 for students when they are involved in verbal or physical altercations between other students or teachers. These conflict resolution circles are led by a trained mediator and allow both parties to reflect on their roles in the problem and how they can move on from it.\nSnow Hill High School junior Dai\u2019Jon Johnson participated in a restorative conference after an altercation with a teacher. During the conversation, the pair realized their argument was a misunderstanding. They talked their way through their issues.\n\u201cI got what I had to say off my chest and the teacher did, too, and we all hugged at the end,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was cool. \u2026 I feel like it really helps you see the other side of people.\u201d\nMore from Youth mental health: What works?\nBuilding community\nRestorative practices involve much more than a reimagined approach to school discipline. They also get students and teachers talking in hopes of preventing disciplinary problems.\nClassrooms use \u201ccommunity-building circles\u201d at least once a week to help students and teachers find common ground with differing emotions and experiences.\u00a0\n\u200b\u200b\u201cThrough positive relationship building, you build stronger character in your students,\u201d Wallace said.\u00a0\nThe circles offer students and teachers an opportunity to share their thoughts on the question of the day and interact through active listening.\u00a0\n\u201cAt first, I wasn\u2019t too keen on it,\u201d said Stevens, the Pokomoke senior. \u201cI actually really do think it does help [keep] the classroom together, especially with our small classroom sizes in Pocomoke.\u201d\nShe said students learn more about their peers\u2019 personalities through discussion questions such as: \u201cWhat superpower would you want to have?\u201d or \u201cWhat are you doing for winter break?\u201d These simple questions open space for students to connect.\u00a0\n\u201cI like knowing more about the people around me,\u201d Stevens said.\nKanye Reid, a junior at Pocomoke, said the circles offer a safe place for those who often don\u2019t speak up in class.\u00a0\nKanye Reid, a Pocomoke High School junior, speaks about his involvement in the school community, including the process of delivering morning announcements. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\n\u201cFor more personal questions as well, if you want to share, it offers a space \u2026 so you\u2019re not just stuck suffering in silence,\u201d Reid said.\u00a0\nTeachers also benefit from community-building circles and discuss personal stories and facts they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have the chance to share. The circles humanize teachers and help students see their instructors as individuals who have their own set of passions and hardships, according to Snow Hill High School government teacher David \u201cD.J.\u201d Draus.\u00a0\n\u201cIt pays off down the road when you go back to being a teacher and you\u2019re asking [students] to do some challenging things \u2026 they don\u2019t want to do as learners,\u201d Draus said. \u201cYou have to basically ask them to trust you \u2026 and you can\u2019t just build trust in students by being a teacher of content.\u201d\u00a0\nCriticism and implementation\nThe use of restorative practices is growing in the nation\u2019s schools \u2014 but not without some criticism.\nThe National Center for Education Statistics reported 59% of schools in their subject pool utilized restorative practices in 2022, up from 42% four years earlier. Parents Defending Education, a nonprofit designed to \u201ckeep politics out of education,\u201d reported 1,474 school districts nationwide participate in the practices.\u00a0\nParents Defending Education claims restorative practices can lead to a lack of accountability for students involved in violent or disruptive behavior. The organization also raised concerns the practices could prioritize \u201cfeelings\u201d over actual consequences, which could halt learning.\u00a0\nThe Delmarva Parent Teacher Coalition, a Salisbury, Maryland, parent-teacher group, agrees restorative practices help create excuses for a child\u2019s bad behavior.\u00a0\n\u201cRestorative Practices does reduce the number of suspensions, expulsions, arrests and juvenile referrals not because it\u2019s effective, but because it\u2019s designed to downplay, minimize and prevent reporting in the name of \u2018social justice,\u2019\u201d editors wrote in a 2024 article called, \u201cWhy School \u2018Restorative Practices\u2019 are Destructive.\u201d\nMembers of the Delmarva Parent Teacher Coalition declined an interview request.\nHowever, supporters of restorative practices said these criticisms may not be enough to discredit the work done at Pocomoke High School and other Worcester County schools.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPocomoke High School faculty members monitor and move throughout a hallway during a class period.

Right: The exterior of Pokomoke High School. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\n\u00a0\nWallace said for restorative practices to work, all students and staff must be on board.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth the time,\u201d Wallace said.\nInvesting in students to provide conflict resolution strategies and promote community will help kids focus on staying in the classroom, she said. When conflict rates drop, students spend more time learning.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThose are hours and hours of time our school administrators and our teachers got back with kids, and hours of time our kids got back in instruction,\u201d Wallace said.\nThe talk-heavy approach intrinsic to restorative practices comes naturally to some, Rayne said. She said through ample training sessions and community investments, any educator can come to adopt \u2014 and appreciate \u2014 restorative practices.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happy humans do,\u201d Rayne said. \u201cWe\u2019re restorative.\u201d",

    "summary": "Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more of school days, has surged across Maryland and the nation post-pandemic, with nearly 27% of Maryland students chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year. Factors contributing to chronic absenteeism include unsafe school environments, frequent moves, family responsibilities, and personal health issues, impacting graduation and college enrollment rates.",
    "content": "Baltimore city principal Yetunde Reeves makes it a priority to encourage strong attendance at her school. Reeves, principal of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, said improving attendance is the first step in educating her students.\n\u201cWe have just made it like a big deal here and it\u2019s something that we have a campaign around,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cEvery time I interact with a student, I always look at their attendance.\u201d\nStudent absenteeism rates have proliferated across the state and the country since the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of Maryland students are absent from school each year.\nHere\u2019s what we know.\n\nWhat causes chronic absenteeism?\nChronic absenteeism, when students miss 10% or more of school, has surged across the nation after the COVID-19 pandemic. This means many students are missing out on at least 18 days of school each academic year.\nIn Maryland, nearly 27% of students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year, an increase of over 7% from 2018, according to Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) data. Chronic absenteeism in Maryland reached almost 40% in 2022.\nAbsenteeism can be caused by a variety of factors, according to Jing Liu, an assistant education professor at the University of Maryland.\nSchool climate can contribute to absences, especially if students don\u2019t feel safe or a sense of belonging to the school, Liu explained. Some students may move homes frequently or have the responsibility to take care of their siblings. Others may deal with personal health issues.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no single reason for student absenteeism,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt\u2019s really complex in terms of the interplay between the individual student, their family, their school environment and even their community.\u201d\nHaving 10 absences across all subjects in 9th grade reduces both the probability of a student graduating and enrolling in college by 2%, according to a 2021 study published in the Journal of Economics. Liu, who contributed to the study, said missing school can lead to lower test scores and grades.\nWhich Maryland counties are facing the highest rates of chronic absenteeism?\nBaltimore City had the highest chronic absenteeism rate of all 24 Maryland jurisdictions, with nearly half of all public school students chronically absent last school year.\nReeves said transportation can be a barrier to Baltimore city students, especially when some travel more than an hour and a half to attend school.\n\u00a0\n\nTwo Baltimore City schools had chronic absenteeism rates higher than 90% last school year. Some schools with a high chronic absenteeism are alternative high schools or serve students with special needs.\nRates were also especially high for high school students. Last school year, 35% of Maryland high school students were chronically absent from school, compared to about 23% of elementary school students.\n\u00a0\n\ufeff\nAbsenteeism rates are higher among Hispanic and Black students. Last school year, over 45% of Hispanic students and over 40% of Black students were chronically absent from school, according to state data. Over 24% of white students and almost 17% of Asian students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year.\nHow can chronic absenteeism be addressed at schools?\nPrincipal Eugenia Young spends many nights worrying about the students absent from class at her Baltimore City high school.\nYoung is the principal of Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High School, an alternative high school that serves adult students who are often many credits away from graduation. Excel Academy had an attendance rate of 44% last school year, according to Baltimore City Public Schools.\n\u201cOur kids don\u2019t get educated, they will struggle,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat means the country will struggle, that means the city of Baltimore will struggle.\u201d\nDespite Excel Academy\u2019s high rate of chronic absenteeism, the high school won an award from Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott after increasing its daily attendance by 16% between 2023 and 2024.\nEffective strategies to combat absenteeism included putting students on attendance contracts and scheduling parent conferences, Young said. The school also provided incentives like gift cards or snow tubing trips.\n\u201cKids really want to do those experiences, because they know in a normal setting, that\u2019s not something that their parents may be able to afford for them to do,\u201d Young said. \u201cThey\u2019re still kids at the end of the day.\u201d\nSebastian Harris, a senior at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore City, said he has barely missed school throughout his academic career. Some students will still skip school because they get bored or can drive somewhere else, he explained.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem because it\u2019s affecting more than just what you\u2019re learning today,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt affects tomorrow and the day after and the day after.\u201d\nBut Harris doesn\u2019t just have strong attendance because of the incentives his school offers. Sometimes, it\u2019s the teachers who make a difference. Many students attend Harris\u2019 Spanish class, for example, because his teacher keeps students engaged.\nMonique Keene-King, a pupil personnel worker in Montgomery County Public Schools, said relationship-building can improve student attendance. This can range from dropping by a family\u2019s house or simply complimenting a student in the hallway, she said.\nUltimately, school staff must let students know that they will not give up on them, Keene-King said.\n\u201cWe care about kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want our young people to be productive and successful community members.\u201d\nHow is chronic absenteeism being addressed at a state-wide level?\nBeyond citywide approaches, state education leaders are taking initiative to address chronic absenteeism across Maryland schools. The Maryland State Department of Education stated it is committed to reducing the chronic absenteeism rate to 15% by next school year.\nA Maryland General Assembly bill introduced in January aims to create a chronic absenteeism task force that will make recommendations to the governor by the end of 2025. Another bill introduced in the same month mandates each county board of education to identify the root cause of chronic absenteeism.\nDelegate Deni Taveras (D-Prince George\u2019s County), the second bill\u2019s primary sponsor, said finding the root cause of chronic absenteeism at the local level will be a smart use of taxpayer dollars.\n\u201cThis will help inform the task force so that they can develop the recommendations that they need,\u201d she said.\nMary Gable, assistant state superintendent at MSDE, said the education department\u2019s current attendance task force is developing a toolkit to address student absenteeism.\nUltimately, school needs to be a place where students feel safe to learn and improve, Gable said. It should be a place, she said, where someone can look at a student and say, \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here today.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's statewide youth mental health program, which supported over 58,000 students in its first eight months, faced significant budget cuts from $110 million to $40 million due to the state\u2019s fiscal crisis. Advocates warn that these reductions will severely impact essential mental health services for students.",
    "content": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Because of incorrect information provided to the Local News Network by a source, an earlier version of this story misattributed the fact sheet noted at the end of this story, which advocates for restoring youth mental health funding in Maryland. The Mental Health Association of Maryland published and circulated that fact sheet. The story has been updated accordingly.\nCatholic Charities of Baltimore won state grants to fight chronic absenteeism in three Maryland public school districts by connecting troubled students with the mental health services they need.\u00a0\nThrive Behavioral Health won state funding to work with students with severe behavioral issues in five school districts to keep the youths from being removed from school \u2014 and the agency said its tactics are working.\nOverall, the new statewide youth mental health program that funded those two efforts supported behavioral health services for more than 58,000 students in its first eight months of operations from March through\u00a0 October 2024.\u00a0 Four out of every five of Maryland public schools received aid for mental health services under the state\u2019s effort.\u00a0\nBut as the General Assembly moved to balance Maryland\u2019s fiscal 2025 budget last spring, lawmakers cut funding for the state\u2019s fledgling youth mental health program from Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s recommended $110 million to $40 million. And with the state\u2019s fiscal problems deepening, Moore is recommending the state allocate $40 million annually through 2030 to a program he once suggested should get $130 million a year starting in fiscal 2026.\nMeagan Pantelis, a clinical social worker at Thrive Behavioral Health, said the proposed cuts would decimate services for students that, in many cases, are just getting off the ground.\n\u201cWhenever I found out about that proposed cut, the very first thing that came to mind is that Gov. Moore is wanting to balance a budget on the backs of our children,\u201d Pantelis said. \u201cI just find that to be just egregious. I mean, why are our children the population that we are targeting? Why are they not the population that we want to build up and support?\u201d\nMoore, however, has stressed the state must act to close a structural $3 billion budget gap driven in part by the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, the 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan that created the youth mental health program.\u00a0\n\u201cWe only have difficult decisions ahead,\u201d Moore said in his State of the State address in early February. \u201cWe must close this $3 billion budget gap.\u201d\nThe mental health crisis\nAmong its many reform efforts, the Blueprint established a new agency \u2014 the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports \u2014 to manage the new statewide youth mental health effort. The General Assembly then provided the agency with $119.7 million over two years to set up its operations and then issue its first $111 million\u00a0 in grants in February 2024.\nThere\u2019s a reason why the General Assembly initially invested so much in youth mental health. During the 2022-23 school year, over a quarter of Maryland high school students reported their mental health was not good at most or all times, according to a Maryland Department of Health survey.\u00a0\nMore from Youth mental health: What works?\nThe percentage was only slightly lower for middle school students, with 22% reporting their mental health was not good at most or all times. Even more students in both middle and high school reported feeling sad or hopeless for at least two weeks in the past year.\u00a0\n\u201cWe all know generally that there\u2019s a mental health crisis,\u201d said Lorianne Moss, the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission program manager. \u201cSo as sort of the preamble to our first call for proposals, we laid out some data.\u201d\nThat data, from the Centers for Disease Control, showed 40% of high school students experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Citing such statistics, the consortium urged mental health programs and nonprofits across the state to apply for funds.\u00a0\nApplicants requested a total of $380 million in grants, said Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, which oversees the consortium. That\u2019s more than three times more than the consortium had to allocate.\nNevertheless, the state funded mental health service providers in every county. The program also allows service providers to offset treatment costs if families do not have access to insurance, or if students have high copays.\u00a0\nWhile Luckner and Moss praised the achievements from the first round of grants, they declined to comment on its uncertain future.\u00a0\nPreventing suicide\nPreventing youth suicide is one of the consortium\u2019s key goals, said Dr. John Campo, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Sixteen of the consortium\u2019s 129 grants so far focus on suicide prevention.\nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and third for people ages 15-24, according to the most recent CDC data.\n \u201cSuicide kills more young people in that age group than cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, infections of all kinds, meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, COVID \u2014 the whole nine yards,\u201d Campo said. \u201cAdd them all together, suicide kills more people than all those things combined.\u201d\u00a0\nCampo, who is also vice president of psychiatric services at Kennedy Krieger Institute, a Baltimore facility that specializes in treating people with neurological, developmental and psychological issues, was invited to join the consortium because of his expertise in the field.\u00a0\nSuicide rates among youth and young adults increased 62% nationwide from 2007 to 2021, according to the CDC. Meanwhile in Maryland, the teen suicide rate increased by more than a third from 2014 through 2022.\nCampo said the state\u2019s health care system has been ill-equipped to deal with that increase.\n\u201cMental health crisis isn\u2019t a priority in most emergency departments,\u201d Campo said.\nCampo is one of the co-chairs of the consortium\u2019s best practices subcommittee, a group that developed a list of evidence-based mental health practices for grantees to implement.\u00a0\nEach program targets a different facet of the mental health crisis. The responses are also tailored to the varying levels of severity of the mental health conditions different age groups experience.\u00a0\nThe consortium found through surveys targeted at both students and parents that 90% of students and families were satisfied with the services.\n\u201cA lot of these practices have been tested,\u201d Campo said. \u201cIf regional organizations adopt them and implement them with fidelity, we really do want to believe that there will be positive outcomes associated with it.\u201d\nFrom the city to the shore\nThe youth mental health crisis touches all of Maryland, and so does the state\u2019s response \u2014 but grants are tailored to the vast differences among Maryland\u2019s urban, suburban and rural communities.\nIn Baltimore City, the 11 grants the consortium issued take into account a stigma surrounding mental health services, said Jennifer Cox, director of the University of Maryland School Mental Health Program, which received a $970,000 grant to run a number of programs.\n\u201cWe think in Baltimore City, we have to be a little bit more creative than just saying, \u2018Come get help,\u2019 \u201d Cox said. \u201cWe know we have good things to offer, we just need to find a good way to offer it.\u201d\nIn working with trusted community organizations such as churches and youth centers, the program has been able to reach people who would otherwise not seek out mental health treatment, Cox said. \nServices range from in-school counseling from certified clinicians to parent and caregiver education programs.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have to invest in it in a significant way now and going forward for the next 30 years because so many of our young people are suffering,\u201d said Britt Patterson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \u201cAs a result, the adults in their lives are also struggling.\u201d\nThe consortium funded a similar but much larger array of programs in Prince George\u2019s County, which received $24.9 million \u2014 the most of any county. The funding will set up a mobile response team to respond to young people experiencing mental health crises while increasing online and in-person counseling and other services.\u00a0\nOne of the county\u2019s largest grants, totaling $2.7 million, went to EveryMind, a nonprofit that is vastly expanding its mentoring and therapy offerings as part of what it calls \u201cProject Wellness.\u201d Projects include training sessions for parents and school staff to teach them more about mental health, including how to manage crises.\n\u201cThis initiative will create a supportive environment where students and families can truly flourish, meeting their mental health needs with compassion, cultural sensitivity and care,\u201d said Patrice Harrell-Carter, director of Project Wellness.\nMeanwhile, the state\u2019s efforts on the largely rural Eastern Shore stress increasing access to treatment in a region that\u2019s short of professionals to respond to the youth mental health crisis. According to the October 2024 report, \u201cInvesting in Maryland\u2019s Behavioral Health Talent,\u201d Maryland is nearly 50% short of the mental health workers it needs.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a resounding message of, we just need more,\u201d said Beth Anne Dorman, CEO of For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center that received a grant to expand its services in Kent County, the state\u2019s least populous. \u201cWe need more.\u201d\nCaroline County, where two organizations won grants to expand their mental health services, faces the same situation, said Derek Simmons, the county\u2019s superintendent of schools.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are a rural county that is less wealthy than a lot of parts of the state,\u201d said Simmons, co-chair of the consortium\u2019s best practices committee. \u201cSo access to behavioral health is near and dear, and a real challenge where I\u2019m at.\u201d\nAn uncertain future\nYet the state budget crunch looms as a threat to its youth mental health efforts.\nIf the General Assembly agrees with the funding levels suggested in the governor\u2019s budget, programs that just started last year may have to be eliminated, said Del. Eric Ebersole, a Democrat who represents parts of Baltimore and Howard counties.\n\u201cThat group worked in good faith to bring providers online,\u201d said Ebersole, a consortium member. \u201cIf the government loses them, can you get them back?\u201d\nDan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said the proposed cut in planned funding comes at a time when youth mental health care is more important than ever.\n\u201cAt a time when 18% of high school students and 24% of middle school students have seriously considered suicide in the past year, a reduction of this size in school mental health funding could prove disastrous,\u201d Martin said.\nIf the General Assembly approves Moore\u2019s budget proposal, the grants distributed by the program in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 combined will be cut 28% from the total amount distributed the prior two years.\nAsked for comment, Moore\u2019s office stressed the governor\u2019s proposed allocation for fiscal year 2026 and beyond is exactly what the General Assembly approved for 2025.\n\u201cGov. Moore is maintaining the current level of funding for the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports,\u201d wrote a spokesperson from the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThe Governor strongly supports behavioral health treatment for Maryland\u2019s children, and maintaining current levels of funding during the state\u2019s budget crisis reflects that commitment.\u201d\nBut the Moore spokesperson\u2019s statement ignored that only a year ago, a Moore budget proposal called for significantly expanding funding for the consortium to $130 million annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2029. Instead, the current proposal allocates $40 million per year through fiscal year 2030.\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland is urging action to try to persuade the General Assembly to restore funding to a higher level. The organization is circulating a fact sheet with information on the consortium, the work it\u2019s done and what a permanent cut in funding would do to students and schools.\u00a0\n\u201cUse the above information and write an email to your legislators asking them to restore funding to the Community Supports Partnership Fund,\u201d the fact sheet said. \u201cProvide testimony (either written or oral or both) opposing the cut\u201d at General Assembly hearings.\u00a0\nAnd under the \u201cwhy is funding needed\u201d section, the Mental Health Association fact sheet reads: \u201cDramatic worsening of the behavioral health of children and youth over the last decade.\u201d",

    "summary": "Gov. Wes Moore's proposal to cut funding from Maryland\u2019s 10-year education reform plan, particularly affecting schools in high-poverty areas, faces significant opposition from students, parents, and educators.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS \u2013 Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s proposal to freeze and cut funding to some programs under Maryland\u2019s 10-year education reform plan is running into major objections from advocates.\nThese cuts could alter the existing law under the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, but controversial measures like freezing funding for schools in high-poverty areas have left the fate of both the bill and the state\u2019s budget unknown.\n\u201cThis is a cut to everyone, but it\u2019s a specific cut to students living in poverty, black and brown students, multilingual students,\u201d said Riya Gupta, interim executive director of Strong Schools Maryland. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to hurt every single student and teacher in Maryland.\u201d\nOverall the bill would slow the implementation of the Blueprint, an ambitious expenditure plan targeting schools set into motion in 2021 by the legislature without a solid payment method. The move targets the budget crisis by generally reducing state spending on public education. Moore\u2019s bill would decrease state spending in public education by $52.6 million for fiscal year 2026, with $727 million in decreases by 2030, according to the fiscal and policy note on the measure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA post shared by Maryland Capital News Service (@cnsmd)\n\n\n\nMajor actions in the proposal include freezing funding increases that community schools, or schools that qualify for a concentration of poverty grant, had expected to see. It also pauses the implementation of an initiative giving teachers more collaborative planning time during the workday.\nNearly every seat in Annapolis\u2019 joint-hearing room was filled at a hearing this week, flooded with students in blue shirts wearing their support for the Blueprint. High school students, parents, education advocates and eight Maryland school superintendents testified in opposition to some or all actions in the bill.\nGupta is concerned about the funding freezes for concentration of poverty grants. These grants are based on a formula calculating the amount of funding required per student. While community schools were set to see a significant increase in funding per student in the initial law, this bill proposes keeping funding at the same level it is currently.\n\u201cWe know anytime we disinvest in schools, bad things happen, and that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d Gupta said.\nLike Gupta, some lawmakers are worried about Moore\u2019s proposal, specifically the cuts to community school funding.\n\u201cIt seems that this is the time that we should be wrapping our arms around our children who are in poverty, who are disproportionately kids of color, and we should be lifting those kids up,\u201d Committee Chair Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a Democrat representing Howard County, said to a panel supporting the bill, including Moore\u2019s chief of staff Fagan Harris.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to say pause, it\u2019s a cut,\u201d Atterbeary continued, referring to the proposal to freeze funding to community schools. \u201cWhen you cut the funding you are leaving a gap where some kids are quite frankly going to be caught out there and left behind.\u201d\nAlong with the funding freeze, the bill would also delay the phase-in of collaborative time, a blueprint initiative requiring that teachers spend 60% of their time with students and the other 40% of their time planning. While this initiative would save the state money, Harris said the delay is due to a teacher shortage.\nTo combat that shortage, the bill proposes establishing a national teacher recruitment campaign. While some lawmakers argued that implementing collaborative time could help boost teacher retention numbers, Harris argued schools do not currently have the bandwidth to implement the program.\n\u201cThis proposal gives us the time to build the community of practice in our schools and across our districts that make our teaching profession stronger,\u201d Harris said, in reference to pausing the collaborative time initiative. \u201cIt also avoids, frankly, stressing a system where we have a profound teacher shortage.\u201d\nWhile many Democrats are worried about cutting funding for impoverished students, Republicans are worried about the overall spending.\n\u201cThe largest takeaway for everyone today should be that Governor Moore\u2019s Administration and the Democratic leaders in Annapolis acknowledged what has been obvious to us for years \u2013 that taxes will have to be raised significantly to pay for the Blueprint,\u201d House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, a Republican representing Allegany County, said Wednesday. \u201cThis certainly counters the ongoing fallacy that the Blueprint does not contribute to Maryland\u2019s budget crisis.\u201d",

    "content": "Maryland is set to examine their current method of evaluating poverty in schools throughout the next year, potentially opening up a pathway to boost funding for schools with students in need.\nA new study is meant to help address the undercounting of poverty in Maryland public schools according to Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman. The Board of Public Works approved funding for the study at its Dec. 4 meeting.\n\u201cThis issue is exacerbated for undocumented students or citizen children of undocumented parents,\u201d Lierman said at that meeting.\u00a0\nThe current method of tabulating poverty \u201creally penalizes\u201d schools with large numbers of immigrant students, Lierman said.\nThe state currently uses proxy measures, such as eligibility for national programs like Medicaid and SNAP, to calculate aid for public schools, according to the proposal for funds from the Department of General Services.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the Governor\u2019s Office for Children an accurate count of students in poverty is important to ensure that they get adequate resources. The office also told CNS that the \u201cBlueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future created several new school funding streams that rely on counts of low-income students.\u201d\nSchools currently rely on applications for the free and reduced meals program and enrollment in social programs like Medicaid as methods of calculating students in poverty. According to the Governor\u2019s Office for Children, \u201cnot all low income families participate in these programs.\u201d\u00a0\nThe office also said that \u201cdistricts that provide free school meals to all students under the federal community eligibility program do not collect that data.\u201d\nIn the case of immigrant families, some may not qualify or, as the office told CNS, may be hesitant to enroll and reveal their citizenship status.\nOther data the state might rely upon is out of date. According to Lierman, the Maryland State Department of Education recently proposed using data from 2013 to calculate school poverty in Baltimore City. Lierman said that many public schools have been shuttered in the city since that data was collected.\n\u201cAs a Baltimore City Public School mom,\u201d Lierman said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of strong feelings about this.\u201d\nThe board approved the DGS request for $48,000 monthly for \u201cmodeling, analysis and providing a presentation on findings.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the Office for Children, a recommendation based on the results of the study will be made to the Maryland General Assembly by Dec. 1, 2025.",

Critics argue this policy can harm students by potentially exposing them to unsupportive or abusive home environments.",
    "content": "In Carroll County, schools are required to notify parents if a student wishes to change their pronouns or otherwise identify as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, according to guidelines published by Carroll County Public Schools (CCPS).\nThis policy contradicts guidelines published by the Maryland State Department of Education, which does not require schools to share information on a student\u2019s sexuality or gender with their parents or guardians.\nCapital News Service analyzed documents obtained from 21 school districts in the state through a Maryland Public Information Act request and found that Carroll County\u2019s school policies on transgender and non-conforming gender students are uniquely stringent in requiring parental notification compared to other counties.\nThe Carroll County school system states parents should be involved in decisions regarding their child\u2019s gender identity including the student\u2019s choice to use their preferred name, pronouns and desired facilities like restrooms and locker rooms in school.\nThe CCPS student services manual states when a student informs the school of their wish to change their gender identity or pronouns, the school will arrange a conference that includes the student, school administrator, school counselor and the student\u2019s parent or guardian.\nAccording to the manual, the conference is mandatory \u201cregardless of the parent or guardian\u2019s knowledge of the student\u2019s status\u201d.\nCCPS and the county school board declined Capital News Service\u2019s request for an interview and declined to provide a comment regarding their policy.\nWendy Novak, a mother to a transgender child attending high school in Carroll County, believes parental notification policies may be harmful to students.\n\u201cStudents are the real stakeholders of the system, and by putting parents first, it ignores the fact that there are some abusive parents,\u201d Novak said.\nNovak said the problem is not just that parents need to be notified if their child wants to go by a different pronoun but they would need to give consent.\nFlorence Ashley, assistant professor of law at the University of Alberta, echoes Novak\u2019s sentiment, stating parental notification measures are put in place \u201cfor parents who are opposed to their kid being trans and who want to effectively try to discourage their kid from being trans.\u201d\nAshley, who uses they/them pronouns, pushed back on the integrity of a parents ability to know things regarding their child, especially if it will presumably put their child in danger.\n\u201cKnowing so that you can help the child grow in their best interests is one thing,\u201d they said. \u201cHaving a right to know even if it\u2019s detrimental to their best interests just because you have this sentiment of entitlement is another and that\u2019s one that I don\u2019t think we can accept.\u201d\nMark Eckstein, co-chair of advocacy for Metro DC PFLAG, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, acknowledged the debate over parental involvement in school matters, particularly for students grappling with identity issues.\n\u201cOn the surface, yes, of course, everyone wants a parent to be involved and to be notified of how their kid is doing,\u201d Eckstein said. \u201cThe issue arises when there aren\u2019t supportive parents.\u201d\nAccording to Eckstein, teachers should first empathize with the student and ensure they are supported at home before involving parents when the student wishes to change their name or gender identity.\nHe called for state-level action to establish baseline protections.\n\u201cA state like Maryland should come in and provide as much local autonomy as possible, but on certain issues, especially those related to civil rights and discrimination and bias, [it] should provide a floor saying that this is the law,\u201d Eckstein said. \u201cThese are the things that should be done to protect, in this case, trans students.\u201d\nIn 2022, Maryland amended and implemented its education policy to include prohibiting discipline of or discrimination against students on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity.\nAlmost a decade ago, the Maryland State Department of Education published \u201cGuidelines for Gender Identity Non-Discrimination\u201d which states that schools are not required to notify parents and should make the decision on parental notification based on consultation with the student. The guidelines recognize that \u201cnotifying parents carries risks for the students\u201d in some cases.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education pointed Capital News Service to the \u201cSafe and Supportive Schools for All Students\u201d guide the department released in October, which emphasized all students\u2019 right to privacy.\nThe guide notes that sensitive information related to student gender identity \u201cgenerally need not be disclosed without the student\u2019s consent\u201d, even though information in official student records must be shared upon parents request.\nThe education department highlighted in the guide that there is no state or federal law that \u201crequires schools to affirmatively disclose this sensitive information to parents\u201d.\nAlthough school districts are not required to follow the guidelines proposed by the state education department \u2013 districts set their own policies and guidelines\u2013 some school districts, like Montgomery County, aim to align their guidelines with the state.\nAccording to Christopher Cram, director at the Department of Communications in Montgomery County Public Schools, Montgomery County\u2019s goal when creating their guidelines was to be inclusive and recognize that LGBTQ+ individuals \u201care absolutely a part of our community.\u201d\nOther Maryland counties\u2013 including Anne Arundel, Caroline and Frederick\u2013 mention parental notification for students who wish to change their pronouns, but in the policies and guidelines reviewed by CNS, none besides Carroll explicitly require it.\nCaroline County, for example, recommends \u201cCase-by-case decisions regarding parent notification should be made in consultation with the student and should reflect all factors that affect the student\u2019s well-being\u201d for high school students in \u201cTransgender Student: Guidelines for Support\u201d from 2021.\nKit Hart, the chapter chair for the Moms for Liberty Carroll County chapter, states parents have a fundamental right to be in charge of their child\u2019s \u201cupbringing, education, moral formation and medical decisions.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental right that was given to us by God (that) cannot be taken away,\u201d Hart said.\nMoms for Liberty is a conservative parent\u2019s rights group that started in January 2021 with chapters across the country.\nMany Moms for Liberty members are \u201crightly alarmed\u201d that schools have been overstepping their authority with their kids, and taking parental authority and rights away, according to Suzie Scott, Harford County\u2019s Moms for Liberty chapter chair.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think gender identity should be discussed in schools. It is, first of all, not a scientific concept, and it is something that, if it is discussed at all, should be discussed at home,\u201d Hart said.\nAccording to the Moms for Liberty website, they hold their school board \u201caccountable by maintaining relationships with each of the Board members\u201d.\nSchool district policies are set by these school boards. The Local News Network (LNN) previously reported on the battle for transgender rights being waged in Maryland school districts. Candidates running for school board in 2024 who responded to a LNN survey were nearly split on the issue of parental notification for gender non-conforming students.\nJoanna Bache Tobin, who successfully won re-election to the Anne Arundel County school board last month, told LNN that \u201cenabling students to determine for themselves how they wish to be addressed and referred to is critical to that safe and inclusive environment.\u201d\nNovak and Shaun Maidens, a mother to a transgender high schooler in Carroll County, have attended school board meetings to bring awareness to the issues faced by their children at school.\nNovak and Maidens\u2019 children endured harassment and bullying in high school since coming out.\nAshley emphasizes the importance of trans youth having affirming spaces. For some students, school is the only place they can be themselves, Ashley said.\nMaidens uses interactions she has with others that question her son\u2019s identity as a learning moment to expose others to the complexities and normalities of LGBTQ+ youth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really parents\u2019 rights,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt\u2019s parents\u2019 rights to control my child too.\u201d",

    "summary": "Conservative school board candidates backed by the 1776 Project PAC won or led in 11 out of 19 races across Maryland, defying expectations in a traditionally Democratic state. The victories were seen as a rejection of the teachers' union's agenda, with the 1776 Project PAC emphasizing voter preference for educational improvement over political issues.",
    "content": "Conservative school board candidates saw sweeping wins across Maryland this week, defying expectations in the largely blue state and solidifying the influence of the 1776 Project PAC, the Republican-aligned organization that endorsed 19 candidates statewide.\nIn total, 11 of the political action committee\u2019s endorsed candidates either won or narrowly led their races as of Friday morning. Candidates backed by the PAC won control of the school boards in Somerset and Calvert counties, while appearing poised to win in Talbot County. Final results await the counting of some mail-in and provisional ballots, which must be counted by Nov. 15.\nCampaign finance records show that the Maryland State Education Association Fund for Children and Public Education \u2014 the political arm of the state\u2019s teachers union \u2014 spent $516,999.57 during the 2024 election cycle. And the 1776 Project PAC clearly sees the teachers\u2019 union as its defeated rival in the election.\n\u201cEven outspending us by $450,000, the teachers\u2019 union couldn\u2019t beat us in deep-blue Maryland\u2014their message is just too extreme,\u201d said Stefano Forte, executive director of the 1776 Project PAC. \u201cVoters chose raising test scores and graduation rates over their far-left culture war. On Tuesday, common sense won, and that has no price tag.\u201d\nA fourth school district with candidates targeted for defeat by Democrats \u2013 Washington County \u2013 also flipped to conservative control without the aid of the 1776 Project PAC.\nOf those 11 winners endorsed by that conservative PAC, six had also been targeted for defeat by the Maryland Democratic Party, which selected 24 \u201cextreme\u201d conservative school board candidates in the state to directly invest against \u2013 a move the party referred to as \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Of those 24, only nine have been lost thus far. The remaining 15 all won or are leading their respective races.\n\u201cWe are proud that we pushed out some of the most extreme elements in these races,\u201d said Luca Amayo, spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s clear, however, that we must continue to bolster our grassroots efforts and make Marylanders aware of the far-right agenda encroaching into Maryland\u2019s public schools, especially as they are emboldened under a Donald Trump presidency.\u201d\u00a0\nThe party considers the 1776 Project PAC a \u201cradical ring-wing group,\u201d and helped defeat five of its endorsed candidates from winning office.\u00a0Ryan James Girdusky, the committee\u2019s founder, wrote on the PAC\u2019s website that he created the organization \u201cto change public education by reforming school boards and electing reform-minded conservatives who wanted to improve public education in this country.\u201d\nAs of Oct. 16, the PAC had pumped $90,580.50 toward the campaigns of 13 candidates across Cecil, Queen Anne\u2019s, Talbot, Calvert, Somerset and St. Mary\u2019s counties. Of those 13, seven have won their elections and one remains too close to call.\u00a0\nIn Calvert County, candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC won all three school board seats.\u00a0\nRetired principal Mike Shisler lost his bid for the board. He said he fears that the new conservative leadership, all of whom were targeted by the state\u2019s Democratic Party as well, would create inequity and fear within the county\u2019s education system.\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in the results,\u201d Shisler said Wednesday, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be inclusive of everybody. It\u2019s going to target folks. It\u2019s going to try to undo the work of previous boards of education when it came to stressing equity and diversity, and I think they\u2019re trying to roll back the clock.\u201d\u00a0\nJoseph Marchio, who defeated Shisler, said he expected a close race going into Tuesday night. His margin was the closest of the three 1776 Project PAC-backed victors in Calvert County.\u00a0\nIn Washington County, on the state\u2019s panhandle, all four candidates that Democrats targeted for defeat won their election, flipping the county\u2019s school board into conservative control. All three non-targeted incumbents lost reelection, while April Ann Zentmeyer, the only targeted incumbent, defended hers.\u00a0\n\u201cI look forward to working with new board members and faithful colleagues to maximize opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and parents; and to identify solutions that will strengthen WCPS,\u201d Zentmeyer said in a statement.\nWashington County has a county-wide school board election process, as opposed to the school districts where candidates are elected by district. Instead of one-on-one races, all school board candidates in Washington County face each other in a crowded pool, with the top four vote-getting candidates winning seats. Carroll, Allegany and Frederick counties have similar systems.\u00a0\nThe success of conservative school board candidates around Maryland reflects a larger trend from this year\u2019s election cycle: the state\u2019s rightward shift. According to data from the Associated Press, every county in Maryland shifted rightward this year compared to the 2020 election \u2013 from two points in Charles County and Baltimore City to eight points in Cecil County.\nSome races remain too close to call. In Frederick County, two conservative candidates targeted by Democrats led the race for three seats as of Friday, but two other candidates trailed close behind. Talbot County, which flipped conservative this cycle, saw two 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidates win seats, while a third trailed by a narrow margin as of Friday.\nSomerset County, the third district flipped by 1776 Project PAC-endorsed contenders, saw massive margins of victory for the conservatives, with Mary Beth Bozman securing about four-fifths of the vote in her race. Her opponent was Alverne \u201cChet\u201d Chesterfield \u2013 who, the Local News Network reported last month, had a peace order initiated against him in 2022.\nThe Local News Network also reported that Brandie Edelen, a 1776 Project PAC-endorsed candidate in St. Mary\u2019s County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019. Edelen handily lost her race to Josh Guy.\nIn deep-blue Howard County, Andrea Chamblee is in a tight race with Trent Kittleman, an early supporter of the county\u2019s Moms for Liberty chapter. Even though Democrat Kamala Harris carried over two-thirds of the votes cast in the presidential race in the county, Chamblee led\u00a0 Kittleman by only 3.5 points as of Friday morning.\nMail-in and provisional ballots, which have leaned in favor of Chamblee this far, are still being counted.\nThe founder of Moms for Liberty in Frederick County, Jaime Brennan, appeared headed to victory. She said that despite the Maryland Democrats\u2019 campaign against her and Colt Black, the other conservative in the race, that effort didn\u2019t appear to be all that effective.\n\u201cThey spent a lot of money in opposition to me and Colt, and to prop up the other side, but I didn\u2019t hear from a single person who said, \u2018Oh, I heard about this and I\u2019m not voting for you,\u2019\u201d Brennan said.\nIn neighboring Carroll County, where Moms For Liberty lobbied for the removal of 60 books from school libraries \u2013 21 permanently \u2013 conservative candidates secured their hold on the board. Greg Malveaux and Kristen Zihmer defeated Amanda Jozkowski and Muri Lynn Dueppen, who together ran an underdog progressive campaign called the Slate for Student Success, which was endorsed by the Carroll County Educators Association.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that a lot of voters in our county chose to kind of take their marching orders from their political party, rather than considering the opinions of the educators,\u201d Jozkowski said. She previously ran and lost in 2022.\nJozkowski said the race was a reflection of the national results, which saw an overwhelming rightward shift in nearly every state and in many down-ballot races. Malveaux and Zihmer were both targeted by the Maryland Democrats.\u00a0\nThat rightward shift could also be seen in the school board race in Anne Arundel County\u2019s District 3. There, the conservative candidate, Chuck Yocum, fell only 2.76 points behind his opponent, Erica McFarland, despite weeks of controversy over Yocum\u2019s 1994 acquittal on child sexual abuse and perverted practices charges.\nLocal News Network reporters Sasha Allen, Marwa Barakat, Ela Jalil, Colin McNamara and Tolu Talabi contributed to this report.\nCorrections: An earlier version of the story said 10 candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC had won their races. The correct number is 11. In addition, an earlier version identified Trent Kittleman as the founder of the Howard County chapter of Moms for Liberty. While she was an early supporter of the group, Lisa Geraghty is the group\u2019s founder.",

    "summary": "Three Maryland school board candidates have faced legal issues, including an acquitted child sexual abuse charge, a peace order over a neighbor dispute, and a tax lien. This year's findings are fewer than in 2022 when 12 candidates had tax liens and one was charged with shoplifting.",
    "content": "Anne Arundel County school board candidate Chuck Yocum made headlines when the Baltimore Banner reported earlier this month that he was accused and acquitted of child sexual abuse three decades ago.\nBut he\u2019s not the only Maryland school board candidate to have faced legal issues of one sort or another. Alverne W. Chesterfield, a Somerset County candidate, had a peace order issued against him in 2022 which, he said, was tied to a dispute with a neighbor. And the state filed a tax lien against St. Mary\u2019s County candidate Brandie Edelen back in 2019.\nThe Local News Network found those two issues in a review of the Maryland and federal court records of all 109 school board candidates in the state. LNN did not find court records of Yocum\u2019s 1994 acquittal on a charge of child sex abuse, meaning the records were likely expunged after a jury found him not guilty.\nThe review found far fewer legal issues among school board candidates than LNN found two years ago. In the 2022 election, LNN found 12 candidates who had faced tax liens and a Charles County candidate who had been charged with shoplifting multiple times.\nThis year, the most serious alleged offense among Maryland school board candidates involved Yocum.\nYocum, who was a special education and social studies teacher at Anne Arundel County\u2019s Northeast High School, was indicted on charges of child sexual abuse and perverted practices, The Washington Post reported more than 30 years ago.\nTerrie Jahnigen Warfield, who says she testified against Yocum, said in a social media post last week that she had sexual relations with Yocum when she was 16 years old.\n\u201cI was emotionally, physically, mentally abused [by Yocum],\u201d Warfied said. \u201cI deserve justice, and so does everyone else that he\u2019s hurt.\u201d\nContacted by LNN and asked for a response to the allegations, Yocum referenced a statement from Warfield\u2019s mother, Kathy Burkhard. LNN could not independently verify the statement, but on Monday, the Baltimore Sun quoted Burkhard as saying of her daughter: \u201cShe is incapable of telling the truth. I\u2019ve had problems with her since she was almost 15.\u201d\nAlthough Yocum was found not guilty of criminal charges, school officials launched a thorough internal investigation, according to The Banner, to determine the validity of allegations that Yocum sexually harassed or made inappropriate comments to students as young as 13.\n\u201cMr. Yocum was found not guilty of sexual abuse in a criminal court. This investigation, however, reviewed additional allegations against Mr. Yocum which were not criminal behaviors but possibly indicative of misconduct or immorality,\u201d stated the school\u2019s internal investigative report from 1994, which was reviewed by The Banner.\nYocum never returned to teaching after the Anne Arundel County Public Schools investigation, The Banner reported.\nSix Anne Arundel Democrats, including County Executive Steuart Pittman, have called for Yocum to drop out of the school board race, citing the allegations of child sexual abuse against him, The Banner reported.\nThe other legal issues that the Local News Network uncovered in its review of the school board candidates are far less serious than those surrounding Yocum.\nLNN found that Alverne W. \u201cChet\u201d Chesterfield, who is running for the Board of Education in Somerset County\u2019s District 2, had a peace order issued against him on May 31, 2022, which was valid through Dec. 6 of that year.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe order states: \u201cShall Not Abuse, Shall Not Contact, Shall Not Enter Residence,\u201d but the court order does not detail the circumstances that led to the peace order or name the person who requested it.\nWhen asked for comment about the peace order, Chesterfield told LNN: \u201cIt is not nothing to really comment on. It was just a dispute between myself and my neighbor regarding property line. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nHe said the disagreement was taken to court, and the matter was solved.\n\u201cIt is nothing serious,\u201d he said.\nLNN also found that Brandie Edelen, who is running for an at-large school board seat in St. Mary\u2019s County, had a state tax lien filed against her in 2019 because of $594.04 in back taxes.\nEdelen said that at the time, she and her family were dealing with funeral expenses and the disposition of the estate of her late father, who passed away in March 2019. She said she got distracted and \u201csimply forgot to file the tax returns.\u201d Filed in May of 2019, the lien was resolved and the tax paid in 2020.\u00a0\nThe LNN review of candidate court records also found liens and other tax cases that may have been connected with other candidates, but could not be conclusively tied to those candidates based on court and State Board of Elections records. This happened in several cases where candidates have common first and last names.\nLNN only reported on candidates where birthdates and addresses conclusively proved they were the person involved in those court cases.",

    "summary": "Maryland\u2019s school board candidates are divided over the $30 billion Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, praising its goals of improving schools but expressing concerns about funding and mandates. Academics, including poor test scores and pandemic-related learning loss, were cited as the top education issue by 27 out of 74 respondents in a Local News Network survey.",
    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network's 2024 School Board Voter Guide.\u00a0\nA 10-year, $30 billion plan out of Annapolis, the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future aims to dramatically improve the state\u2019s public schools by boosting teacher salaries, expanding pre-kindergarten and rewriting the curriculum \u2014 and school board candidates say the state\u2019s schools need that improvement.\n\u201cThe Blueprint is Maryland\u2019s surest path to creating beyond great schools,\u201d said Phelton Moss, a school board candidate from Prince George\u2019s County.\nBut to hear other Maryland school board candidates tell it, the Blueprint is a budget-buster.\n\u201cThe Blueprint sounds great on paper; however, funding it is a great challenge for every county in Maryland,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s County school board candidate Elena Brewer said.\nThat debate echoes across Maryland as voters in 20 of the state\u2019s 24 school districts prepare to go to the polls. With early voting set to begin on Thursday, Oct. 24, the Local News Network at the University of Maryland sent a questionnaire to all 109 candidates, asking them, among other things, to name the state\u2019s top education issue.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcademics came out on top. Twenty-seven of the 74 candidates who responded cited issues such as poor test scores and pandemic-related learning loss as the top issue. And 55 candidates offered at least some measure of praise for the Blueprint as a way to make Maryland\u2019s schools better.\n\nBut at the same time, 42 of the candidates who responded to the questionnaire expressed concerns about the costs and the mandates stemming from the Blueprint. In a school board election where there are no races in Baltimore City or County, a Prince George\u2019s County candidate, Zakyia Goins-McCants, summed up the views of a number of candidates from suburban and rural districts.\n\u201cThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future is transformative legislation that reflects our state's commitment to equitable education,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it was passed without a full funding plan, and the financial implications are significant.\u201d\n'A transformational investment'\nPassed by the General Assembly in 2021 over the veto of then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, the Blueprint is built on five pillars. Under the Blueprint, school districts are mandated to:\n\nCombat the teacher shortage by increasing the minimum teacher salary to $60,000 by July 2026 and build new \u201ccareer ladders\u201d for educators.\nExpand pre-kindergarten so that it\u2019s available free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all.\nAdjust the curriculum to ensure students are college- and career-ready by the end of 10th grade.\nImplement a \u201cninth-grade tracker\u201d system to assess how the Blueprint is working for each student as part of a statewide accountability plan.\nBoost funding to match the state\u2019s lofty new goals.\n\nHearing all of that, many of the state\u2019s school board candidates said the Blueprint is a great but complex and pricey plan.\nTierney Davis, a board candidate from Cecil County, called the Blueprint \u201ca transformational idea\u201d but noted there are serious issues in implementing the plan. Veronica Lowe from Frederick County called it \u201ca transformative investment in our education system\u201d but expressed concerns about funding the effort.\nMichael Shisler from Calvert County said the plan is a chance to \u201cimprove our common good.\u201d\n\u201cIf we continue to see education as a cost, rather than as an investment, then folks will just wait for this latest reform to fade away,\u201d Shisler said. \u201cThe Blueprint is an opportunity to level the playing field for all kids in Maryland.\u201d\nSeveral candidates said that the playing field needs leveling.\u00a0\n\u201cThe most important issue facing Anne Arundel County Public Schools is the existence of persistent gaps in opportunity and achievement between different subgroups of students,\u201d said Joanna Bache Tobin of Anne Arundel County.\nMeanwhile, Julie Kaplan of Howard County said schools must improve to make sure every student leaves school prepared for college or a career.\n\u201cWe must address the learning gaps created by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d she said.\nA number of candidates cited stagnant or declining test scores in their school districts and beyond.\n\u201cStatewide, our student proficiency rates in math and English are suffering,\u201d said Laura McKenzie of Kent County.\nBut schools will improve if the Blueprint is implemented properly, its supporters said.\n\u201cThe Blueprint offers us an opportunity to invest in our schools and ensure an excellent education for every student,\" said Meg Ricks, a candidate for the school board in Howard County.\n\u2018Unfunded\u2019\nSupport for the Blueprint was by no means uniform among the state\u2019s school board candidates, however. Many echoed the thoughts of Andre Gao, another Howard County school board candidate.\n\u201cThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future sounds promising on paper with its goals, but the funding presents a significant problem,\u201d Gao said. \u201cWithout adequate financial support, implementing the Blueprint will be challenging.\u201d\nThe Blueprint lacks financial support at both the state and the district level.\u00a0\nThe General Assembly approved the Blueprint without determining how it would be paid for, and as a result, the state is projected to run long-term deficits that largely track its increased education costs. A state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January said that the deficit will appear in fiscal 2025 and hit nearly $2.93 billion in fiscal 2029 \u2013 a year when the Blueprint is set to cost the state $4 billion.\nRachel Hise, the executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board, said she is hopeful the Maryland General Assembly will fully fund the Blueprint and is willing to make changes if necessary.\nWhen asked whether state taxes will be raised to support the Blueprint, Hise said, \u201cThat is a decision for the governor and General Assembly.\u201d\u00a0\nAgainst that backdrop, Gov. Wes Moore \u2013 a longtime proponent of the Blueprint \u2013 has acknowledged that the plan may have to be altered.\n\u201cWhile I believe in making sure that we have a world class education system, we've got to be able to work together to create an actual plan to be able to implement it because right now there are real challenges in being able to get that done and get it done in a way that the locals, and the state and every other partner who's involved sees that taking place,\u201d Moore told Fox45 News in Baltimore in July. \u201cSo, there have to be adjustments.\u201d\nMeanwhile, school district candidates said the Blueprint is already putting pressure on local school budgets, given that school costs in Maryland are shared by the state and its 24 districts.\n\u201cWhile the Blueprint was touted as significantly increasing education funding, the reality is that the funding is not distributed equitably, and rural counties have been left out, by and large,\u201d said Cathy Allen, a school board candidate in St. Mary\u2019s County. \u201cWe did not receive increased funding from the state to cover mandates within the Blueprint.\u201d\nSome candidates from larger Maryland counties expressed similar concerns.\n\u201cThe Blueprint is unfunded and full of mandates that will strain local school systems and their taxpayers,\u201d said Joseph Marchio of Calvert County, who noted that Hogan vetoed the plan. \u201cThe Blueprint, while well intended, is focused around the belief that if you just throw enough money at a problem, it will go away or improve.\u201d\n'So many requirements'\nSchool board candidates said they worry not only about the Blueprint\u2019s costs, but also about the expensive edicts the plan imposes on local school districts. In some cases, they said, those mandates are already leading to unintended consequences.\nJon M. Andes, a candidate in Worcester County on the Eastern Shore, said he fully supports the Blueprint\u2019s five pillars.\n\u201cHowever, without additional state funding, we will not be able to implement the Blueprint plan without making significant budget cuts to reallocate funds,\u201d Andes said. \u201cAs an example, to reach the $60,000 minimum (teacher) salary, we will need to significantly increase class size and reduce materials of instruction.\u201d\u00a0\nSuch things are already happening in Howard County, Gao said.\n\u201cIn our school district, we have not received sufficient funding from the state and county to fully implement the Blueprint,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has contributed to budget shortfalls, leading to staff cuts, program reductions and increased class sizes. Many teachers have already expressed concerns about the negative impact of staff shortages and increased class sizes.\u201d\nSuch issues stem from the fact that the Blueprint mandates that funding be redirected in a number of ways. For one thing, by mandating higher teacher salaries and a host of other changes, some school districts may be forced to cut other popular programs.\n\u201cThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future mandates so many requirements that it's difficult for our local school system to continue programs it feels are successful,\u201d said Kerry Gunshenan, a school board candidate in Talbot County.\nIn addition, the Blueprint mandates that districts direct more funding to schools with larger numbers of high-need students, such as those that are performing poorly or where students are learning to speak English.\nMike Lukas, a board member who is running for re-election in Charles County, praised that change.\n\u201cYour ZIP code or household income should not define the quality of your education,\u201d he said.\nBut Jaime Brennan, a school board candidate in Frederick County, said shifting money toward low-performing schools won\u2019t necessarily make them better.\n\u201cThere is nothing in the Blueprint that will actually improve student performance, and it is designed to take money from districts and schools that are doing well and transfer it to schools that are not, when the issues at those schools cannot be solved by just spending more money on them,\u201d Brennan said.\nMeanwhile, Tom Woods, who is running for re-election to the board in Garrett County, neatly summed up the thoughts of many of the school board members across the state.\n\u201cThe ideas and solutions presented by the Blueprint come with an awful lot of obstacles,\u201d Woods said.\nLocal News Network director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Maryland school board candidates are advocating for increased school safety measures, including the return of police officers and the addition of mental health services, to address a range of issues threatening students' well-being. Concerns span from physical threats and bullying to mental health struggles and poor learning environments, with many candidates expressing dissatisfaction with current safety conditions.",
    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network\u2019s 2024 School Board Voter Guide.\u00a0\nIn Montgomery County, school board candidate Brenda M. Diaz worries that\u00a0 \u201cknife-wielding vandals\u201d have easy access to schools because the district removed the police officers that are on hand in the rest of Maryland\u2019s public school districts to try to keep the peace.\nAcross the state on the Eastern Shore, school board candidate Karla Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County told the Local News Network in a candidate survey that teachers feel threatened by some of their students.\nAnd in Howard County, school board candidate Andrea Chamblee \u2013 whose husband, John McNamara, was shot to death in the 2018 mass shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis \u2013 said the threat of a school shooting is just one of the stressors looming over the county\u2019s children.\n\u201cBullying, mental health struggles, technology addiction, unreliable transportation, larger class sizes, fewer fine art enrichment opportunities, portable classrooms, overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings, food insecurity, poor indoor air quality and bigotry are all eroding the well-being of our students and staff,\u201d Chamblee said. \u201cStudents who aren\u2019t well, can\u2019t learn well.\u00a0 In order to focus on academics, we must take on these safety challenges and provide students and staff with a stable learning environment.\u201d\n\nConcern about school safety in Maryland spans the state \u2013 which is why candidates in Maryland\u2019s school district races are stressing the issue. Of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network questionnaire, 48 said they were not entirely satisfied with school safety in their district. Many called for adding more law enforcement officers as well as mental health counselors to their local schools.\nDiaz advocates returning school resource officers to Montgomery County schools \u2013 but statistics, and the comments of school board candidates statewide, make clear that school safety and student behavior aren\u2019t easily controlled just by in-school cops.\nSchool safety at a glance\nThe school safety problem is a national one. Violent incidents increased 49% in the nation\u2019s schools the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Educator\u2019s School Safety Network.\nMaryland has not yet released its 2023-2024 statistics, but in the 2022-2023 school year, the number of anonymously reported bullying or cyberbullying incidents rose over the prior year from 91 to 107 , according to the Maryland Center for School Safety. The number of assaults and threats to cause harm increased from 83 to 98. And the number of general school safety complaints shot up from 62 to 104.\nThe school safety center also tracks critical life threatening incidents, which are defined as incidents that cause death or serious injury, or acts of mass violence under law. These incidents for the past three school years totaled 17, 18 and 18.\nAmong those incidents are the following:\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2023, at a Baltimore City high school, a student worked in tandem with both of his parents to assault and shoot three other students.\nIn April 2024, Montgomery County Police arrested a high school senior who had written a 129-page manifesto on his plans for a school shooting.\nIn January 2024, a high school student was arrested after threatening mass violence and arson at the school, the Somerset County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. The student had previously been caught with a gun at school, according to a county press release.\n\nSchool board candidate Matthew Warren Lankford, whose son was in the school at the time of that last incident, said that student is now back in school. \u201cThis student needs special attention and should never be allowed back in the school as a normal student again,\u201d Lankford said.\nSchool resource officers\u00a0\nSchool resource officers, the official name for trained officers in schools under Maryland\u2019s 2019 Safe to Learn Act, are posted in some schools in every Maryland jurisdiction except Montgomery County. And many school board candidates expressed support for hiring more school resource officers.\u00a0\n\u201cI am satisfied with the safety for the big, catastrophic-type events,\u201d said Jaime Brennan, a Frederick County school board candidate. \u201cBut I am not satisfied with the daily acts of violence\u2026that occur. I think that expanding the school resource officer program so that we have a designated SRO in each middle and high school would help.\u201d\nThe Maryland Center for School Safety is responsible for training school resource officers in the state and reports each year on their coverage in schools. The overall number of schools with a full-time officer on hand increased from 273 in 2021-2022 to 288 in the 2022-2023 school year. \nIn Calvert County, another candidate who is running for reelection, Antoine White, said he meets regularly with his board\u2019s safety liaison and local sheriff\u2019s department. White voted to increase the number of school resource officers in his district.\nBut another candidate in Calvert County, Paul Harrison, said he is not content with the lack of armed officers in six schools and pledged to try to fill those gaps.\nIn contrast, Montgomery County ended its school resource officer program in 2021 amid concerns that students of color were being disproportionately disciplined. The district now has a community engagement officer program, in which officers patrol near schools and enter schools as needed. \nA PTA president running for the school board in the county, Rita Montoya, said the officers allowed in schools must be properly vetted.\n\u201cProviding opportunities for healthy and positive engagement between students and officers is another necessary step,\u201d Montoya said.\nMore school districts opt for a constant, visible law enforcement presence. Worcester County Board of Education member Jon M. Andes touted his district as the first in the state to have school resource officers.\n\u201cWe need to continue work with our law enforcement partners, enhance our summer safe schools retreat, and strengthen our proactive approach to preventing problems,\u201d said Andes, who is running for reelection.\nConversely, Gerry LaFemina worries about the use of officers in schools in Allegany County, where he is running for the school board.\n\u201dI loathe the idea of making our schools seem like they\u2019re under attack because that provides an atmosphere ripe for distraction,\u201d he said. \u201cI also worry about the use of police in the schools, which can often lead to escalation of problems rather than mediated solutions.\u201d\nOther than LaFemina, none of the 74 candidates who replied to a Local News Network survey questioned or opposed assigning police officers to schools.\u00a0\nMore counselors?\nMany candidates made clear, though, that school resource officers can\u2019t solve the school safety problem alone. Twenty-five\u00a0candidates mentioned increased mental health or counseling intervention as an important step in their survey response.\n\u201cSchools should prioritize not only physical safety but also students\u2019 social and emotional well-being,\u201d said Tiffini Andorful, a Prince George\u2019s County school board candidate. \u201cThis could include increasing the number of support staff and providing access to resources and training to effectively handle conflicts. I also think there should be a greater emphasis on emergency preparedness and increased advocacy for gun control at higher levels.\u201d\nMany also emphasized the importance of building a healthy school atmosphere beginning when students are young.\u00a0\n\u201cWe really need to focus on social-emotional learning and fostering a culture of acceptance of others from the youngest grades and up,\u201d said Erica McFarland, an Anne Arundel County candidate.\nMcFarland said she feels that this type of focus can help to prevent bullying, a common reason for students to feel unsafe at school.\nMeg Ricks, a candidate in Howard County, said increased counseling services would likely stem other problems, too.\n\u201cWe must start while students are young to give them tools for dealing with conflict and seeking help when needed,\u201d she said in her survey response. \u201cI would like to see more counselors in our schools so that we can provide students with productive solutions to the challenges they are facing.\u201d\nAt the same time, 13\u00a0candidates statewide said that the secret to solving the school safety puzzle lies not just in school resource officers and mental health services, but in old-fashioned school discipline.\n\u201cWe need to re-address school discipline measures and take improved steps to reduce the threats and in some cases, violence,\u201d Wieland-Cherry of Talbot County said. \u201cTeaching and learning cannot take place in an environment (where) one feels unsafe.\u201d",

Washington County has implemented a policy requiring devices to be off and out of sight during instructional hours, with similar measures gaining traction across the state.",
    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network\u2019s 2024 School Board Voter Guide.\u00a0\n\u201cFOCUS NOW! PHONES LATER,\u201d blares the newest school cellphone policy out of Washington County.\u00a0\nThis \u201cclear message\u201d debuted on the county\u2019s website in August, kicking off the 2024 school year with stricter limitations on personal electronic devices.\u00a0\nThat message is one that resonates with Maryland\u2019s school board candidates. Of the 74 candidates who responded to the Local News Network\u2019s campaign questionnaire, 64\u00a0favored strict restrictions on cellphones in schools, and only 10 expressed reservations about limiting cellphone use or touted their positive aspects.\u00a0\nBoard candidates cited a number of reasons \u2013 ranging from disciplinary issues to cyberbullying to phone addiction \u2013 for ordering students to put their phones out of sight.\nSome candidates offered nuanced proposals for limiting cellphone use \u2013 but support for greater restrictions spans the state, from large counties to small.\n\nRita Montoya, a lawyer who is running for an at-large school board seat from Montgomery County, said the district\u2019s cellphone policy should be \u201caway all day\u201d \u2013 which is the name of a pilot program in the district this year.\n\u201cAs a parent, I understand the need for some students to have a cellphone with them at school, but it should not be used at school so as to limit distractions and negative peer interactions including violence,\u201d she said.\nWashington County already requires all devices to be off and out of sight during instructional hours in its schools. Robin Merchant Spickler, a former kindergarten teacher and current school board candidate in the western Maryland county, fully supports the new policy.\n\u201cThis has been a long time coming. It is in the best interest of the students\u2019 well-being and their academic progress,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will help the students learn in a positive and productive environment.\u201d\nA growing trend\nSchools across the state have already begun implementing stricter cellphone policies in public schools. According to a survey conducted by the Capital News Service this fall, at least a third of Maryland school districts have tightened their cellphone regulations this school year alone.\u00a0\nHowever, these policies vary. Some schools prohibit students from using their devices throughout the entire school day, while others, such as Anne Arundel County, allow high school students to use them during lunch only.\nSome counties have begun forcing students to lock away their phones. In Baltimore County, 16 middle and high schools have issued clear pouches in which students must insert their phones to make them harder to access during class time.\nAnnette Anderson, the deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools, said there are good reasons for mimimizing cellphone use among youngsters.\n\u201cWhat we know is that it\u2019s shifting the way that the brains of the developing child is growing,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern in terms of the mental health of our young people.\u201d\nBetween 2008 and 2015, hospitals in the U.S. reported suicidal ideation or attempts among children and adolescents ages 14 to 18 almost doubled, according to a 2020 study. Published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the study delved into the relationship between youth cellphone and social media use and mental health.\nThe study found that internet addiction is \u201cparticularly associated\u201d with self-harm and suicidal behavior. \nAnderson said cellphone use also hinders students\u2019 ability to develop interpersonal connections vital to job performance later in life.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening actually is that students are so focused on this phone that\u2019s in front of their faces that they\u2019re not actually having interpersonal dialogue,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThey\u2019re not having the kinds of conversations at the lunchroom, at the lunch table in their classrooms.\u201d\nTeachers nationwide are worried about cellphone use, too, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center from June. The survey found that 72 percent of high school teachers alone cite cellphone distractions in the classroom as a \u201cmajor problem.\u201d\nMany school board candidates also said cellphones have become a distraction.\u00a0\nIn Calvert County, cellphones are banned in classrooms, and school board candidate and former educator Michael Shisler backs that ban.\u00a0\n\u201cThis problem did not happen overnight, and it will not be solved overnight,\u201d said Shisler, who spent nearly 30 years as an elementary school principal. \u201cCellphones have moved beyond a distraction to being an addiction \u2013 an addiction that brings increased social pressures and the need for constant social validation.\u201d\nAllegany County school board candidate and Frostburg State University professor Gerry LaFemina agreed. He said the impact cellphones and social media have on students is the most jarring problem in county schools that he hopes to address.\n\u201cBesides being a distraction, the dopamine hit of responding to notifications can have an addictive effect on our students. This can lead to educational and disciplinary issues,\u201d LaFemina said.\nLaFemina did not specify what policies he would implement if elected, but the county has light limitations on use in the classroom, often leaving it up to teacher discretion.\u00a0\nSt. Mary\u2019s County candidate Mary Washington, who has served on the board for the past 27 years, said she is pleased with the county\u2019s new plan to restrict phone use during instructional time.\u00a0\n\u201cThis change will focus on increasing learning and achievement, promoting a safe and orderly school, diminishing discipline referrals, and nourishing more face-to-face contact with each other,\u201d Washington said.\u00a0\nDifferent perspectives\nWhile most school board candidates throughout the state provided a variety of concerns surrounding cellphone use in schools, many had different perspectives on what a ban should look like in their county.\u00a0\nOut of Prince George\u2019s County, lawyer, substitute teacher and school board candidate Angela R. Jones said she supports tighter regulation but not a full ban.\u00a0\n\u201cI propose a balanced cellphone policy that allows limited use during non-instructional times, such as lunch and between classes while prohibiting use during lessons,\u201d said Jones, the legislative director for the Maryland State Senate. \u201cThis approach respects students\u2019 need for connectivity and emergency contact while minimizing distractions during instructional time.\u201d\nIn addition to the social connectivity phones can provide students, some candidates cited the educational use of devices in schools, saying they can be used in the classroom in moderation.\u00a0\nLetonya Smalls is also running for the school board in Charles County. She has a doctorate in education leadership and said she has seen students benefit directly from phone usage in the classroom.\u00a0\n\u201cI remember one of my students pulling out his cellphone to take a picture years ago. I asked what he was doing, and he said, \u2018I am taking a picture of the homework, Ms. Smalls,\u2019\u201d Smalls said. \u201cHe smiled, and I honestly didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it because I knew it worked for him. Each student is different, and each student learns differently.\u201d\nSmalls proposed a strict policy enforced by teachers during instructional time but not a complete ban. However, like some other candidates, Smalls said she believes that students and parents should be involved in developing any new policy. She proposed a contract for cellphone use for both parents and students to review and sign.\nIn Frederick County, school board candidate Veronica Lowe took a similar stance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in creating a policy without fully understanding the issues and concerns that led to its development,\u201d said Lowe, former director of transportation for Frederick County Schools. \u201cWe need to gather a collaborative group that includes parents, students, teachers, support staff, administrators, bus drivers and community members to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.\u201d\nLowe also brought up the intersection of school safety and cellphone policy and said she believes that in light of recent school shootings, students need to have a way to communicate in emergencies.\nAnd one candidate \u2013 Maisie T. Howard of Anne Arundel County \u2013 voiced concerns that a ban would do more harm than good, especially for special needs students, those from rural areas and those who thrive in virtual environments.\n\u201cThe cellphone is not the enemy,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many of us, it is our only computer.\u201d\nIn contrast, some candidates, like Ann O\u2019Connor from Talbot County, believe in a full ban in elementary and middle schools, along with emergency access only in high schools. O\u2019Connor, a former high school Spanish teacher and mother of six, said she believes a tougher phone policy could decrease mental health issues, bullying and distraction in schools.\n\u201cIf Talbot County wants to lead the way on protecting our kids from short attention spans and gaps in core knowledge, this is the No. 1 thing that needs to happen,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\u00a0\nAnd O\u2019Connor said those most in the know about the county\u2019s schools agree with her.\n\u201cI have talked to a number of teachers about cellphone use in school, and they unanimously tell me the same thing,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cBan them.\u201d\u00a0\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Letonya Smalls is running for the board of education in Prince George\u2019s County. She is a candidate in Charles County.",

    "summary": "Colt Black, a candidate for the Frederick County Public School Board, opposes book bans but supports a review process involving public input for books in school libraries. A survey of Maryland school board candidates shows mixed views, with many supporting professional involvement in ensuring age-appropriate content and others firmly opposing any form of book bans.",
    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network\u2019s 2024 School Board Voter Guide.\u00a0\nColt Black is many things: a mortician, an emergency medical technician, a firefighter, a father, a husband and a candidate for the Frederick County Public School Board. He\u2019s also a self-professed First Amendment absolutist.\u00a0\nSo, when Black was asked about what material should be available to Frederick County students in their school libraries, his response followed suit.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t support book bans,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nYet like many Maryland school board candidates, Black\u2019s detailed views on the book issue are nuanced. In his vision for Frederick County Public Schools, any book, whether it be instructional or recreational, would be reviewed in committee and public hearings before making its way onto school shelves.\n\u201cBooks which contain extreme violence or are sexually explicit, which glorify these things with no academic value, should be removed,\u201d Black said in response to a University of Maryland Local News Network questionnaire sent to all 109 school board candidates in the state. \u201cAll books, both instructional and library resources, should be reviewed by a committee and public comment accepted before allowing them or disallowing them in the educational setting.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s support for such a process isn\u2019t unique in his county, or Maryland at large. Asked in a Local News Network survey if they favored book bans, 38 of the 74 candidates who responded to the LNN questionnaire said they favor a policy in which professionals are involved in making sure books are age-appropriate. Another 19 strongly opposed book bans without citing policies for reviewing books.\n\u201cI will vote against book bans and the editing of curriculum based on personal beliefs,\u201d said Sarah J. McDermott, who is running for the school board in Anne Arundel County\u2019s District 4. \u201cNo topic should be banned from curriculum or libraries, provided that they are age appropriate, and I really trust our librarians and educators to determine that for their students.\u201d\nHowever, 17 candidates were open to banning books that parents find objectionable.\n\n\u201cI am running for the Board of Education because I would like to review our curriculum and establish age-appropriate educational materials for K-12 and eliminate any materials that sexualize children and are not appropriate for minors,\u201d said Elena Brewer, a school board candidate from St. Mary\u2019s County. Brewer is one of 19 candidates in the state that won an endorsement from the 1776 Project PAC, a conservative group whose founder, Ryan James Girdusky, says on the group website that he created the PAC after objecting to books on race issues that a teacher read to his godson\u2019s class.\nA patchwork of policies\nAmid parents, activists and school boards challenging books across the state, Gov. Wes Moore signed the Freedom to Read Act into law earlier this year in an attempt to put an end to book bans in Maryland public schools.\u00a0\nThe law prohibits public schools from excluding or removing materials from their school libraries because of the origin, background or views of the author. It also states that material cannot be removed because of partisan, ideological or religious disapproval. School systems must adopt book review policies where challenged books remain on the shelves until the review process concludes.\nHowever, the legislation fails to affect the majority of books banned throughout the state. According to Steve Wernick, the director of curriculum and instruction for Carroll County Public Schools, the bill only mandates that counties have adequate processes in place for the removal of library content \u2013 and because Carroll County already had a committee in place that had banned books, its decisions stand.\nA unanimous school board vote removed over 60 books in Carroll County \u2013 21 permanently. The banned titles include:\n\n\u201cAnd They Lived,\u201d a gay-themed young adult novel by Steven Salvatore.\n\u201cIdentical\u201d by Ellen Hopkins, a novel about a young woman sexually abused by her father.\n\u201cKingdom of Ash,\u201d \u201cHouse of Earth and Blood,\u201d and \u201cA Court of Frost and Starlight\u201d \u2013 popular fantasy novels by Sarah J. Maas.\n\nMeanwhile, Wicomico County banned \u201cAll Boys Are Blue,\u201d George M. Johnson\u2019s\u00a0 coming-of-age novel about a young queer boy. Frederick County banned Hopkins\u2019 \u201cTriangles,\u201d which publisher Simon & Schuster described as a \u201csurprisingly erotic\u201d novel that includes adultery about three women\u2019s intersecting friendships\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n And Queen Anne\u2019s County banned \u201cHarbor Me,\u201d Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s novel about multicultural kids navigating their way through a multitude of problems, which was a New York Times Book Review\u2019s \u201cKids Notables\u201d selection for 2018.\nWith November\u2019s school board elections approaching, the issue of book bans will once again appear on the ballot in the form of races between conservative candidates and their opponents. Candidates endorsed by the conservative 1776 Project PAC are running in nine Maryland counties.\nThe Carroll County precedent\nIn Maryland\u2019s largely liberal central corridor, Carroll County has always been an outlier. Jutting southward from the Mason-Dixon line, it\u2019s surrounded by liberal enclaves and Frederick County, a former Republican stronghold that flipped blue in the 2020 presidential election for the first time since 1964.\u00a0\nAs demographics shift and the Democratic party strengthens its regional claim, Carroll County remains stubbornly independent. While it isn\u2019t uncommon to have a couple of books challenged over the course of a year, Carroll County\u2019s 21 permanent removals drew headlines earlier this year.\nOne of the county\u2019s board of education candidates, Amanda Jozkowski, said she opposes such actions.\n\u201cWhile there may be rare instances where a book is deemed unsuitable for the school library, these decisions should be based on clear, consistent criteria focused on educational value, not on censorship or ideological preferences,\u201d she said in responding to the candidate questionnaire.\nJozkowski said Carroll County is a proving ground for conservative policies \u2013 especially within schools. She noted that the county has a large and active Moms for Liberty chapter that is helping chapters in other counties. Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that stresses parents\u2019 rights, burst onto the scene in 2021 and has led the fight for book bans in many school districts.\nTo offer a different future for Carroll County educators and students, Jozkowski is collaborating with fellow board candidate Muri Lynn Dueppen on the Slate for Student Success, a joint candidacy that highlights the pair\u2019s shared values and encourages voters to mark their names at the top of November\u2019s ballot. On its website, opposition to book banning is listed as one of the pair\u2019s core values.\u00a0\nJozkowski hopes that voters see her as an alternative to the conservative candidates she opposes. She said she believes that many Carroll County residents are tired of the \u201cpolitically motivated orientation\u201d of the current school board.\u00a0\nBut, in a county that hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 60 years, her success is far from guaranteed. Among her challengers is Kristen Zihmer, a 38-year-old small business owner who called herself a \u201cconservative lifelong resident\u201d of Carroll County and who, according to the Baltimore Sun, has been endorsed by Moms for Liberty.\nZihmer listed Ronald Reagan as the political figure she admired most and said: \u201cMy goal is to uphold the family and community values that make our county exceptional.\u201d Asked about book bans, she said: \u201cWhen materials are open to question, I default to parental consent\u2026I would state unequivocally that I do not condone materials that are sexually gratuitous in nature or feature extreme sexual content.\u201d\nA debate in Howard County\nIn March, the Howard County chapter of Moms For Liberty laid out plans for its latest initiative: the elimination of 46 books from Howard County Public Schools\u2019 shelves, following in Carroll County\u2019s footsteps.\nWhile the chapter\u2019s measures have failed thus far, one of its early supporters is now running for a spot on the county\u2019s board of education. Trent Kittleman, a former state delegate who lost re-election in 2022, requested to be taken off the Moms for Liberty rolls when she began her school board campaign, Baltimore Fishbowl reported in March.\nBut her views on the issue remain staunchly conservative. She decried a 2021 ban on six Dr. Seuss books with harmful stereotypes, but she remains concerned about other kinds of books..\n\u201cThe misnomer \u2018book banning\u2019 being criticized these days is an effort by many parents to have certain books removed from school libraries due to what they consider explicitly sexual content,\u201d Kittleman said in response to a Local News Network questionnaire. \u201cIt is not unreasonable to have explicitly sexual content \u2018that serves no redeeming social purpose,\u2019 removed from the schools.\u201d\u00a0\nKittleman offers the Democratic stronghold a new vision for its public schools, one in line with the Republican values she touted during her eight years in the Maryland House of Delegates. One of her opponents, incumbent Jen Mallo, offers the opposite.\n\u201cA diverse and inclusive set of library books are critical to have in our schools,\u201d said Mallo, who chairs the Howard County Board of Education. \u201cWe need to actively work to include these materials despite extremist fear mongering and demands for removal.\u201d\n\nThe issue goes to court\u00a0\nMontgomery County\u2019s battle between conservative parents and school board members looks a little different than those in the rest of the state. In September, a group of parents filed a petition asking that the Supreme Court review the school board\u2019s refusal to allow parents to opt their elementary children out of classes using LGBTQ+ books, citing a violation of their First Amendment rights.\nThe books are part of the district\u2019s effort to be more inclusive by adding titles with LGBTQ+ characters in their kindergarten through 12th-grade curriculum.\u00a0\nBrenda M. Diaz, one of the county\u2019s school board candidates, is siding with those parents.\u00a0\nDiaz, a social studies teacher at Fusion Global Academy with more than 20 years of education experience, said that since Maryland state law allows parents to request exemptions for their children from certain portions of the sex education curriculum, she would extend these same rights to parents for books their children can access.\u00a0\n\u201cEach school should be able to determine with their body of parents which books should be removed,\u201d she said in her response to the LNN candidate questionnaire.\nYet Lynne Harris, a board member running for re-election in Montgomery County, believes public opinion shouldn\u2019t be a factor when determining which books students can access\nHarris, currently the vice president of the Montgomery County Board of Education, strongly supports the county\u2019s LGBTQ+ curriculum.\n\u201cIf families want to restrict the books their students read, they have many avenues to do that,\u201d Harris told the Local News Network in August, \u201cbut imposing these choices and personal judgments on thousands of others is not appropriate.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland school board candidates are divided over policies that allow transgender and gender-nonconforming students to choose their pronouns without informing parents, with 32 out of 74 candidates opposing such policies and prioritizing parental rights. However, 29 candidates support creating a safe and inclusive environment for students, even if it means withholding information from parents.",
    "content": "This story is part of the Local News Network\u2019s 2024 School Board Voter Guide.\u00a0\nThe culture war erupting around the nation about transgender rights is being fought in Maryland\u2019s school districts, too.\nSchool boards that set policy for those districts face a dilemma: Do they prioritize a student\u2019s autonomy over their identity or the parents\u2019 right to know who that child really is?\u00a0\nIn previous years, some school districts enacted policies that allowed transgender or gender-nonconforming students to choose their pronouns, while also not informing the parents of their decisions. \nYet in deep blue Maryland, 32 of 74 school board candidates who responded to a Local News Network survey indicated that these policies go a step too far. Nineteen of those candidates are running for board seats in the 10 Maryland counties that have chapters of Moms for Liberty, a conservative group that stresses parents\u2019 rights.\n\u201cParents should be fully informed about everything happening at school involving their child. There should NEVER be a situation where information is withheld from parents,\u201d wrote Carroll County school board candidate Kristen Zihmer, who has been endorsed by Moms for Liberty.\nA slightly smaller number of candidates \u2013 29 \u2013 prioritize creating a \u201csafe and inclusive\u201d environment for students, even if that requires withholding information from parents.\u00a0\n\nAnne Arundel County school board member Joanna Bache Tobin, who is seeking re-election, said students succeed in school when they have a sense of belonging.\u00a0\n\u201cEnabling students to determine for themselves how they wish to be addressed and referred to is critical to that safe and inclusive environment, and therefore to student achievement,\u201d said Tobin, a consultant and parent in the Anne Arundel County public school system.\u00a0\nYet the issue remains sensitive. As if to prove it, 13 candidates either refused to answer the LNN survey question about pronouns or did so in a way that did not take a stand on the issue.\nPronouns: A history\nAlthough discourse and vitriol around pronouns have become increasingly common in the past few years, the usage of \u201cthey\u201d as a gender-neutral personal pronoun can be dated back to the 14th century in a French poem, according to a video guide from LBGTQ@MIT.\nCenturies later, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary added \u201cthey\u201d as a singular nonbinary pronoun in 2019, citing its prevalence in discourse and rebutting the common argument that opponents have used: that they/them pronouns are grammatically incorrect because it\u2019s applying singular use to a plural word.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Biden administration recently made headlines when it rewrote regulations under Title IX \u2013 the federal ban on sex discrimination \u2013 to cover bias against gender identity or sexual orientation. This federal civil rights law prevents sex-based discrimination in any school that receives federal funding.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis rewrite would require that schools refer to students by the pronouns they use. However, federal lawsuits have blocked the change at least temporarily in 26 Republican-led states.\nIn contrast, many counties in Maryland have embraced a progressive policy on pronouns. For the 2020-2021 school year, Montgomery County Public Schools drafted a guideline for student gender identity that encourages employees to make support plans for transgender and gender nonconforming students. This approach allows students to decide on their identity at school, whether it be their preferred name or pronouns.\u00a0\n\u201cPrior to contacting a student\u2019s parent/guardian, the principal or identified staff member should speak with the student to ascertain the level of support the student either receives or anticipates receiving from home,\u201d the guideline reads.\u00a0\nThat policy also prompted a federal lawsuit. Conservative parent groups argued the guidelines violate the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process under the law by restricting the parents\u2019 ability to direct care and control education for their minor children. A group of three parents took their argument to court with the support of the conservative National Legal Foundation.\u00a0\nA federal court dismissed the case in 2022, and a federal appeals court did the same the following year. The courts ruled that the parents didn\u2019t have legal standing to have their case heard. The parents appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and the court dismissed the case again in May.\u00a0\nHowever, the parent group noted in its petition that similar lawsuits have been filed across the nation. And Frederick County candidate Jaime Brennan, the former chairwoman of the county\u2019s Moms for Liberty chapter, argues that such policies remain in legal jeopardy.\n\u201cWe are seeing districts across the country be sued for policies like this,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI think it is only a matter of time before they are subject to huge judgments, not to mention the defense costs for these bad policies.\u201d\n\u2018Age-inappropriate\u2019\nElena Brewer, a school board candidate from St. Mary\u2019s County, said she believes that allowing the usage of pronouns diminishes the rights of other students because it is \u201cage-inappropriate\u201d language. Her campaign issues consist of parental rights, education not indoctrination and age-appropriate curricula.\u00a0\n\u201cSchools are for education, not sexualization,\u201d said Brewer, one of 19 Maryland candidates endorsed this year by the 1776 Project PAC, a conservative group that emphasizes parental rights and criticizes \u201cwoke\u201d ideology.\u00a0\nFor others, policies of nondisclosure undermine the relationship between parents and children.\u00a0\n\u201cIf we are not informing parents of students\u2019 decisions about their preferred pronouns and maybe questions about their identity, what other aspects of their school life are we not informing parents?\u201d said Ann O\u2019Connor, a school board candidate from Talbot County, who also received a 1776 Project PAC endorsement.\u00a0\nThis belief in parental rights stands at the center of a conservative movement that says it is trying to save public school students from liberal indoctrination.\u00a0\nHoward County school board candidate Trent Kittleman said that like other conservative candidates, she strongly opposes policies that allow schools to withhold information from parents when a child chooses alternate pronouns..\u00a0 Kittleman is a former state delegate who lost re-election in 2022 and asked to be taken off the Moms for Liberty rolls when she began her school board campaign, Baltimore Fishbowl reported in March.\n\u201cIt is imperative to recognize that parents hold the ultimate responsibility for raising their children; attempts to undermine this fundamental role are both misguided and potentially harmful,\u201d Kittleman said in response to the LNN candidate questionnaire.\nKittleman\u2019s website says that she fought against progressive legislation for eight years in the Maryland legislature and that she believes in a system that prioritizes parental involvement.\u00a0\n\u2018Safe and supported\u2019\nThe use of gender-neutral pronouns is increasingly common, with recent studies showing that 56% of Generation Z respondents know someone who uses gender neutral pronouns, a National Institutes of Health article said. Advocates of the approach say using an individual\u2019s correct pronouns can act as a sign of respect.\u00a0\u00a0\nAllegany County school board candidate Max Green said it\u2019s not the role of teachers to tell parents what pronouns students are using in school.\n\u201cEvery student deserves to feel safe and supported in school, regardless of their identity,\u201d Green said. \u201cUsing preferred pronouns fosters an inclusive environment and allows students to feel accepted. Importantly, this practice causes no harm to others \u2014 it simply reflects respect for the individual.\u201d\nMultiple candidates cited the importance of respecting pronouns for the safety and health of transgender or gender non-conforming students.\u00a0\u00a0\nMontgomery County incumbent candidate Lynne Harris emphasized the vulnerability of LGBTQ+ youth to bullying or rejection from family.\u00a0\n\u201cI am proud that Montgomery County Public Schools policy is to provide a welcoming and supportive space for students, to support them in expressing their gender identity, and to partner with families in supporting LGBTQ+ students EXCEPT when the student tells us they will not be safe if family are informed,\u201d Harris said.\u00a0\nThe Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ+ youths, found in a 2020 national survey that transgender and nonbinary individuals who had their pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those that didn\u2019t have their pronouns respected.\u00a0\n\u201cIf we can save lives by using preferred pronouns and names, then it is incumbent on us to do so,\u201d said Jen Mallo, a Howard County Board of Education member who is running for re-election. \u201cIt is not only a good thing to do, but also the right thing to do.\u201d\nSeveral candidates also said it is OK for schools to not disclose a student\u2019s preferred pronouns to parents. They said doing so makes school a safe space for students.\u00a0\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are still situations where a child faces being kicked out of their home or ostracized for coming out to their family. Our duty as a school system is to support the child,\u201d said Erica McFarland, a school board candidate from Anne Arundel County.\u00a0\nDespite the debate over pronouns, none of these candidates surveyed chose gender identity and pronouns as the most significant issue affecting schools today. In Carroll County \u2013 where conservative school board members have voted to remove 21 books from library shelves \u2013 candidate Muri Lynn Dueppen said it\u2019s time for the board to focus on something else.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe focus of the board needs to return to academics instead of the deeply divisive culture wars,\u201d Dueppen said.",

    "content": "Classrooms across Maryland are a bit more quiet this fall, with students under new rules to keep their phones off and out of sight.\u00a0\nAt least a third of Maryland public schools have tightened up the rules this fall, according to a Capital News Service survey conducted this month.\nMeanwhile, public schools in and around Baltimore are cracking down on phones during instruction \u2013 and, in some cases, even on the bus.\u00a0\nIn Caroline County, on the eastern shore of Maryland, public schools have a new pilot program in two middle schools. It requires students to place their phones in locked pouches. The pouches stay with the students but remain locked until the end of the school day.\n\u201cToday\u2019s youth battle constant distraction caused by cell phone alerts and messaging that interrupt their ability to focus,\u201d Supt. Derek L. Simmons said in a recent notice to students and parents. He said this \u201ccreates a negative impact on school culture and learning.\u201d\u00a0\nElsewhere, administrators are getting creative about persuading students to go along with the plan.\u00a0\nIn St. Mary\u2019s County, Supt. Scott Smith recently released a video describing the district\u2019s new plan to limit the distractions caused by cell phones.\u00a0\nIn the video, he comically stops midway through his presentation of the new rules to take out his phone and text, showing students how difficult it can be to have a conversation when they are disengaged and on their phones.\u00a0\n\u201cHold on, just wait a second, I\u2019m just going to text him real fast,\u201d Smith said in the video, pretending to send a message.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s really rude isn\u2019t it?\u201d he then pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be having a conversation, and I\u2019m interrupting myself and I\u2019m getting on my phone and I\u2019m texting.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not really here right?\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of distracted.\u201d\nSince the start of the school year, in St. Mary\u2019s County, they have confiscated around 30 cell phones per day, Smith told the school board in a recent meeting. That\u2019s out of 10,000 students, he said at the meeting.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have had many conversations about the joy of being in a classroom without the distraction of cell phones,\u201d Smith said, adding that he and his staff \u201ccontinue to work with our secondary students about the joy and some of the challenges of cellular devices and how we can maximize our joy and fun in life.\u201d",

    "content": "PAROLE, Md.\u2013Local libraries are currently facing almost a dozen different book challenges,\u00a0 with critics of stories like Bye-Bye Binary and The Blackbird Girls calling for their removal from shelves.\nBut these books and other challenged stories are still available on the shelves in Anne Arundel County, thanks in part to protections county officials have recently put in place.\nThe Anne Arundel public libraries this month became the first library system in the state of Maryland to be designated a \u201cbook sanctuary,\u201d dedicated to collecting and protecting endangered books, and holding book talks and other events designed to make them broadly accessible.\n\u201cWe want to preserve everyone\u2019s ability to read the things they want,\u201d said Rachel Myers, the branch manager of Discoveries: The Library at the Mall, one of the Anne Arundel libraries, located in this town near Annapolis.\nDeclaring the library a book sanctuary, Myers said, shows that, \u201cWe are steadfast in our dedication to being a place that is protective of books and of people\u2019s freedom to read,\u201d\nAfter beginning in 2022 in Chicago, sanctuaries have since spread to twelve other library systems in North America.\nIn Anne Arundel, the library\u2019s Board of Trustees decision follows the passing of the Freedom to Read act last spring, which Gov. Wes Moore signed into law. The act says that any library receiving funding from the state has to follow certain standards and can\u2019t, among other things, remove material due to partisan, doctrinal, ideological or religious disapproval.\nOver the past five years, Maryland public libraries have seen a dramatic increase in staff threats and bomb threats related to book bannings, according to the county website.

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Md.\u2014 A federal judge on Monday is scheduled to hear arguments over a request by a University of Maryland student organization to prevent the university from canceling an Oct. 7 campus vigil that would commemorate the lives lost in the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the past year.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations and Palestine Legal filed a federal lawsuit Sept. 17 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on behalf of the student group, the University of Maryland\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, challenging the university\u2019s cancellation of the vigil.\nThe suit accuses the University of Maryland, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents and Dr. Darryll Pines, president of the University of Maryland, College Park, of \u201cengaging in unconstitutional content-based discrimination.\u201d\nThe hearing on an injunction will be before U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nPines and the University System of Maryland released letters Sept. 1 canceling all student-led \u201cexpressive events\u201d scheduled for Oct. 7, which they said would be replaced by university-sponsored activities \u201cdedicated to discourse and reflection\u201d at the University of Maryland and all other universities in the Maryland system.\n\u201cThe First Amendment does not allow campus officials to establish free-expression black-out days, even on occasions that may be emotional or politically polarizing,\u201d Gadeir Abbas, CAIR\u2019s national deputy litigation director, said.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Maryland, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed an amicus brief Wednesday in support of the University of Maryland\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine\u2019s lawsuit. The free speech organizations argue that the Oct. 7 restriction is an unconstitutional and unreasonable attempt to \u201csilence speech about Israel and Palestine.\u201d\nThe student group\u2019s leadership told Capital News Service that their Oct. 7 event planned to include teach-ins, student speakers, interfaith prayers and a vigil.\n\u201cBy canceling our event, the University of Maryland has continued to deliberately erase the Palestinian perspective from campus,\u201d Daniela Colombi, a board member for the University of Maryland\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine, said. \u201cWe are horrified beyond words at the obstruction of the advancement of equality, justice and liberation.\u201d\nThe University of Maryland\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine requested and received approval July 31 to host an \u201cawareness event\u201d on Oct. 7 on McKeldin Mall, a focal point of the College Park campus. Two days later, after the reservation was publicly listed in the university\u2019s student registration system, the university administration requested to meet with the student group, the lawsuit says.\nIn an Aug. 19 meeting with Pines and Dr. Patricia Perillo, vice president for student affairs, board members from the student group explained the purpose of the event. Pines and Perillo asserted that \u201cthey had been receiving pressure from groups inside and outside the university to cancel UMD-SJP\u2019s reservation, but they are committed to protecting the free speech of students,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cYou are likely to see and hear expressive activity on campus on issues you may or may not agree with\u2026as a public institution, we cannot discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint, and must therefore allow such groups to be heard,\u201d Pines said in an Aug. 26 letter to the campus community.\nThe university continued to receive backlash from some pro-Israel groups in the following days.\nA petition started by End Jewish Hate calling on the University of Maryland to rescind its permission garnered nearly 30,000 signatures, according to the lawsuit. On Aug. 28, Perillo told the student group that parties outside the university were concerned the event would \u201cglorify violence,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nOn Sept. 1, university administrators revoked the University of Maryland\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine\u2019s Oct. 7 reservation, citing student safety concerns.\nThe lawsuit claims that the campus-wide bans were based on a viewpoint issue, challenging the legal basis that Pines provided in his Sept. 1 letter.\nThe lawsuit uses Pines\u2019 own words from the Sept. 1 letter to argue that the university system violates the First Amendment. Despite emphasizing safety concerns, Pines said that he \u201crequested a routine and targeted safety assessment for this day\u201d and the University of Maryland Police Department assured him that \u201cthere is no immediate or active threat to prompt this assessment.\u201d\nThe University of Maryland Police Department and the University of Maryland\u2019s Office of the President declined to comment on the lawsuit. Mike Lurie, the University System of Maryland\u2019s media relations and web manager, told CNS that \u201cthe University System of Maryland does not comment on pending litigation.\u201d\nGene Policinski, a senior fellow for the First Amendment at the Freedom Forum, told CNS that for the University System of Maryland\u2019s ban to be constitutional, the defendants will have to prove that their decision was based on significant safety concerns, rather than the student group\u2019s views and that an alternative method of expression would be provided.\nRabbi Ari Israel, executive director of Maryland Hillel, told CNS: \u201cWe believe the university emphasized being thoughtful about student safety and are appreciative of the university\u2019s decision regarding student gatherings on October 7th.\u201d He also expressed gratitude for Pines and the administration\u2019s \u201csupportive leadership as Jewish life and Maryland Hillel continue to thrive on campus.\u201d\nThe University of Maryland\u2019s Jewish Student Union and Terps for Israel told CNS that while they \u201crespect all parties\u2019 right to pursue legal actions,\u201d they believe \u201cthe university\u2019s decision to cancel all events for both groups was the best decision under the circumstances.\u201d\nThe University of Maryland\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine\u2019s board members told CNS that they worry this ban, if unchallenged, would set a precedent, inhibiting pro-Palestinian speech for students across the country.\n\u201cAs UMD-SJP, we have a responsibility to our fellow peers at this university and to students nationwide to stand up for our collective and constitutional rights to free expression,\u201d Colombi said.\nReactions to the ban from student groups and officials have been mixed.\n\u201cWe are relieved that SJP will no longer be able to appropriate the suffering of our family and friends to fit their false and dangerous narrative,\u201d the Jewish Student Union, Israeli American Council, Maryland Hillel and Terps for Israel said in a joint statement on Instagram. \u201cWhile we are reassured by this decision, we are distraught that it had to be made at all. We wish that we could have utilized campus space to grieve together as a community.\u201d\nPolicinski said judges often defer to school administrators \u201cbecause they\u2019re balancing the rights of others\u2019 First Amendment rights in the process of education.\u201d\n\u201cThese (cases) are often very, very fact-dependent on the specific circumstances on campuses, but any time speech is restricted, I think it merits a very close look at, what the lawsuit mentions, very strict scrutiny,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "Maryland is counting on private child care providers to take part as the state expands its pre-K program \u2014 but many providers don\u2019t plan on becoming involved.\nIn a spring survey of the state\u2019s child care providers conducted by the Local News Network, only 12.9% of respondents said they plan to or were already involved in the pre-K program created under the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, the state\u2019s expansive education reform plan.\nMore than a third of the 256 respondents said they were unsure whether they will participate in the pre-K expansion \u2014 but nearly 40% said they would not participate.\u00a0\nThe pre-K expansion plan under the 10-year Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future aims to expand pre-K enrollment to all 4-year-olds and all lower-income 3-year-olds through a \u201cmixed delivery system\u201d involving both public schools and private child care operations.\nBut many child care providers who responded to the survey said they are reluctant to take part in the program. Some said they would have trouble finding staff for a pre-K operation. Others said they didn\u2019t want to get the additional education required to qualify for the program. And others said they didn\u2019t want the Maryland State Department of Education to be more involved in their business than it already is.\nPatti Smith, the director of Greenway Learning Center in Greenbelt, said she\u2019s also concerned developmental differences between 3- and 4-year-olds would make managing a pre-K program difficult.\nAsked if she would take part in the pre-K expansion, Smith said: \u201cIt\u2019s more \u2018no\u2019 than \u2018maybe,\u2019 just for the first year because I want to see what other providers do. And I don\u2019t have faith in MSDE. You know, I don\u2019t think they have all the answers \u2014 so I\u2019m not ready to be that guinea pig.\u201d\u00a0\nThe mixed delivery system\nThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, which the General Assembly passed in 2021, calls for widespread changes throughout the state\u2019s public schools.\nAnd one of the most wide-ranging changes is a vast expansion of early childhood education. The plan calls for state-funded pre-K to be available to all low-income 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 fiscal year. Pre-K will be free to all 3- and 4-year-olds from families that earn up to 300% of the federal poverty level. A sliding scale will determine what families with incomes between 300% and 600% of the federal poverty level will pay for pre-K, while higher-income families will pay for it in full.\n\u201cThis is another step in the right direction to ensure pre-kindergarten programs continue to grow and create more opportunities for our children and families, especially those who have been historically underserved,\u201d Maryland State Board of Education President Clarence\u00a0 Crawford said in 2023.\nWhile 40% of the state\u2019s eligible youngsters were enrolled in pre-K in the 2022-23 school year, the Blueprint aims to double that percentage in a decade. Given that 30,718 young Marylanders were enrolled in pre-K in 2022-23, the change means tens of thousands of additional children will be enrolled in pre-K in the coming years.\nState officials have set a goal of having private providers fill half the state\u2019s pre-K slots by the 2026-27 school year.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd part of the reason for that is \u2026 there is not enough space in the public schools to actually provide all those slots for pre-K,\u201d Rachel Hise, the executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board, said at a conference of school principals late last year.\nHise acknowledged, though, that the mixed-delivery effort faces some major challenges, including one that haunts the state\u2019s entire child care system.\n\u201cThe pandemic really drove a number of child care providers out of business,\u201d she said.\nA widespread reluctance\nOn top of a statewide shortage of child care providers \u2014 which the Local News Network at the University of Maryland documented earlier in this series \u2014 education officials face another significant challenge in creating that mixed delivery system. The Local News Network survey this spring found many remaining child care providers are either reluctant to participate in the pre-K expansion or are refusing to take part.\n\n\n\nSeveral child care providers said joining the pre-K program would make a hard job even more difficult.\n\u201cI'm overwhelmed with the day-to-day operational issues,\u201d such as staff turnover and increased operating costs, said Dana Miller of Little Smiling Faces Childcare in Mitchellville, in Prince George\u2019s County. \u201cHaving to find a qualified teacher (for pre-K) would just add more issues.\u201d\nGiven the widespread concern about a pre-K staffing shortage, the General Assembly this year amended the Blueprint by creating several new pathways for people interested in becoming pre-K teachers or teacher assistants. The legislation, which Gov. Wes Moore subsequently signed, exempts pre-K teachers assistants with more than five years of experience from a Blueprint requirement that they have an associate's degree.\nNevertheless, the state's pre-K expansion still faces other challenges.\nMichele Stritch, owner and operator of Michele Stritch Family Child Care in Dundalk, said in response to the survey that she is reluctant to participate in the pre-K because she doesn\u2019t know what it entails. She also noted her center faces financial challenges and concerns about state regulations.\n\u201cI am inclined to not participate because I do not want the state being even more involved in how I run my business,\u201d Stritch said.\nThe results of the LNN survey showed the percentage of child care providers who want to take part in the pre-K program \u2014 12.9% \u2014 is exactly the same as the percentage of those who had never heard of it.\n\u201cI would love to participate but have never heard of the program,\u201d said Charnetta Bailey, owner and operator of Children Learning Wonders in Ellicott City.\nA publicity push?\nTold about the survey results, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Education, Raven Hill, indicated better publicity is the key to making sure more child care providers decide to offer pre-K.\n\u201cMSDE continues to invite private providers to participate in PUSH to Pre-K webinars to increase awareness of publicly funded Pre-K and provide accurate information and support regarding Pre-K grant opportunities and requirements,\u201d Hill said in a written response to questions submitted by the Local News Network. \u201cMSDE will continue to encourage local education agencies to engage private providers in their areas about pre-K opportunities and the pre-K grant program benefits to children and families.\u201d\nIn addition, the state is tweaking its grant awards program to make more child care facilities eligible for pre-K funding, Hill said.\nTiffany Jones, owner of Precious Moments Family Childcare\u00a0 in Rockville, said she plans on participating in the expansion program. However, she said it\u2019s difficult for many child care providers to understand the state\u2019s pre-K effort.\u00a0\n\u201cThe requirements to participate in pre-K expansion are very challenging for the average family child care provider,\u201d she said. \u201cSo while pre-K is a wonderful program, they need the spaces in family child care for the system to really work \u2014 but there are a ton of requirements for providers (that are) very difficult.\u201d\nEven so, some child care providers said they plan on taking part in the pre-K expansion because doing so is important for the survival of their business. After all, if they lose 3- and 4-year-olds to either public schools offering pre-K or to other providers, that means fewer enrollees and lower revenue.\n\u201cI feel the school is taking all of the 4-year-olds and some of the 3-year-olds,\u201d said Laurie Arnold, owner of Laurie Arnold Home Daycare in Frederick, who plans to take part in the pre-K program. \u201cIn order to keep my numbers up, I have to adjust.\u201d\nIn time, despite the fact that she said she doesn\u2019t want to be a \u201cguinea pig,\u201d Patti Smith of the Greenway Learning Center may end up adjusting, too.\u00a0\nShe said she\u2019s taking a wait-and-see attitude toward joining the pre-K expansion and may join it eventually. But she said she\u2019s afraid those providers who decided to take part starting this year may have a difficult confrontation with reality when the next school year starts.\n\u201cCome September, they're gonna go: \u2018Oh, we don't have enough room. We don't have enough teachers,\u2019 \u201d Smith said. \u201cI do think they've bitten off more than they can chew.\u201d\nLocal News Network director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.\nClarification:\u00a0An earlier version of this story failed to mention legislation signed by Gov. Wes Moore in April that will allow teachers aides with five years experience to be exempt from the state requirement that they hold an associate's degree or a child development certification to work in a state-sanctioned pre-K.",

    "content": "When Stephanie Jovine searched for child care for her nearly 4-year-old daughter LuzMarie in Prince George\u2019s County in 2015, she found two options, both of them bad. Jovine couldn\u2019t afford the first one, and the second denied the young girl snacks and then sheets for sleeping.\n\u201cI was so upset, you know, it was so hard to trust anyone,\u201d said Jovine, a teacher in the District of Columbia Public Schools at the time.\nAfter six months of searching, Jovine found a grandmother who ran a small before-and-after care service, LiLi\u2019s Child Care Center, in Temple Hills. The times the program was open aligned perfectly with Jovine\u2019s needs.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a godsend, for real,\u201d said Jovine, who\u2019s now 33.\nJovine\u2019s arduous search for child care is not unique \u2014 and it would not even be her last search. Interviews with several Maryland families showed that while finding child care is hard, finding a facility that fits a family\u2019s needs and budget is even harder.\nMaryland offers a rating system to help parents select the right child care facility, but providers say the rating system is difficult to navigate. Most parents interviewed by the Local News Network said they never looked at the state rating system.\nSimilarly, the state offers a generous scholarship program to help pay for child care, but providers complain they often have to wait months for the state to pay for child care for those scholarship recipients. Parents like Jovine struggle with the scholarship program, too.\nThe complications of finding child care in Maryland often leave families waiting for a place for their child, and that can lead to trouble, said Doug Lent, communications director for Maryland Family Network, which helps parents find child care and helps providers manage their businesses.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on that waiting list, that\u2019s when you\u2019re more likely to be tempted to rely on unlicensed care, unregulated care, and get into a situation that\u2019s maybe not safe or maybe not high quality,\u201d Lent said.\nThe ratings dilemma\nLinda Garey woke up at 6 a.m. on a springtime Saturday at her home in Dundalk to create a communication board for the autistic children she cares for daily in her home. Eleven hours later, she was still working on the project. She isn\u2019t paid for the time she spends preparing her classroom.\nGarey is a level-3 provider with Maryland EXCELS, the child care quality rating system in the state that offers a top rating of 5 to the state\u2019s top child care centers. Garey created a 65-page handbook outlining her teaching philosophy. She also assists other programs with their handbooks.\n\u201cI\u2019ve typed probably about 20 to 30 handbooks and turned them in for other people, right? And they\u2019re all level 5,\u201d she said.\nEXCELS \u2013 which stands for \u201cExcellence Counts in Early Learning and School Age Care\u201d \u2013 is an optional program for licensed child care providers. It offers them training and guidance and, if they qualify for it, a rating that parents can refer to when choosing a place to care for their child.\nThe Maryland EXCELS rating is based on five categories: licensing, staff qualifications, accreditation, developmentally appropriate practices and administrative policies. The highest overall rating a facility can get is the lowest rating it gets in any of those five categories.\nAnd even though Garey has more than 20 years of experience, her lack of national accreditation as a child care provider means she can\u2019t go higher than level 3.\u00a0\nGarey is working on getting her child development associate credential and becoming accredited \u2014 but she won\u2019t be submitting that information to Maryland EXCELS. She said whenever she submits new documents and information to the Maryland State Department of Education, it goes to waste.\n\u201c\u2019I turned in some information about 20 times and it was denied,\u201d she said.\nState officials insist they are trying to help. Jena Smith, the director of quality improvement initiatives at the state\u2019s Division of Early Childhood, said quality assurance specialists work with each child care facility to improve its quality rating.\u00a0\nThe Maryland State Department of Education also publishes a provider toolkit that outlines the documents necessary to rise up the ratings ladder, Smith said. The requirements for each level build on the last, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scaffold, and so that\u2019s really how our quality assurance specialists work with our programs,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey help them assess where they currently are and where they want to go.\u201d\nSince January 2020, the number of level-5 providers in Maryland has increased by 9.6%, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. However, 15 of the state\u2019s 24 jurisdictions have lost level-5 providers, and providers overall appear to have mixed feelings about the EXCELS program.\nAsked to rate the EXCELS program\u2019s effectiveness on a 1-to-5 scale, with 1 being least effective and 5 being most effective, the 256 child care providers who replied to a Local News Network survey gave the program an average rating of 3.\n\u201cI answered 3 because part of the program, I feel, has been extremely helpful, such as writing policies for guidance (on) nutrition and such,\u201d Cheryl Thomsen, a child care provider in Salisbury, wrote in her survey response. \u201cI did obtain accreditation but found it was very difficult to actually follow all the requirements properly on a daily basis.\u201d\nA difficult search\nJovine moved from Prince George\u2019s County to Waldorf, in Charles County, in 2020 and left teaching. Two years later, she returned to the District of Columbia Public Schools system while pregnant with her second child \u2014 only to discover searching for child care was still difficult and time-consuming.\n\u00a0\u201cI was looking and looking and looking for child care,\u201d she said.\nJovine experienced exactly what other young mothers have experienced in recent years. She went on a frantic search for child care without referring to the state\u2019s EXCELS ratings.\nPriya Mahfooz\u2019s son Zakir was born in May 2019. She sent Zakir to a child care facility near the family home in Clarksburg, in Montgomery County, a few months later. But that operation shut down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, never to reopen.\u00a0\nDesperate for child care, Mahfooz and a friend banded together to hire the teacher who ran that closed facility to look after their children. Each family paid the teacher $425 a week.\nIn the summer of 2021, Mahfooz decided to send Zakir back to a child care facility. During her search, Mahfooz said, she didn\u2019t rely on Maryland EXCELS or the state inspection reports.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re searching, it\u2019s really just whatever you\u2019re being fed in your feeds,\u201d Mahfooz said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about price, location, [online] ratings.\u201d\nMahfooz found a child care slot for Zakir later that summer in Germantown and then enrolled him in Green Valley Montessori School in September 2021.\nMeanwhile, Javiera King, an administrator at the University of Maryland, had to hire a nanny to take care of her young daughter, Layla, while the family searched for a slot in a child care facility.\nWhile pregnant, \u201cI had to put myself on a waitlist already because most day cares have a waitlist a year out,\u201d she said.\nKing\u2019s nanny gave her two weeks notice in December 2023. That meant King had to quickly piece together a schedule where family members took turns caring for her daughter, who was 11 months old at the time. The family then found a child care facility that had a part-time slot for Layla, meaning the family\u2019s piecemeal plan for caring for the young girl would continue.\u00a0\nFinally, in February, Layla\u2019s part-time slot at that facility became full-time.\n\u201cWe were really lucky with how everything played out for us,\u201d King said.\nJovine wasn\u2019t so lucky. When she was five months pregnant with her second child, she called 12 child care facilities. All of them had a waiting list of a year or more for infants.\n\u00a0Her daughter Lily was born at the end of February 2023, and Jovine finished the school year on maternity leave. She had to go back to work in August, but the earliest availability at most nearby child care facilities was in October.\n\u201cThere was one spot that had an availability. I wasn\u2019t too satisfied with it,\u201d Jovine said.\nThere were few toys and learning tools. The outdoor play equipment was dirty and the facility had no curriculum for promoting development in infants, Jovine said.\nShe found another option on a billboard. Jovine called that facility and when she found they had a spot, she took it. She only took three days off work to care for Lily.\nThe facility Jovine sent Lily to after a 10-month search is enrolled in the EXCELS program but is not yet rated.\nAsked if she referred to the EXCELS system during her search, Jovine said she didn\u2019t even know about the state rating system at the time.\nJovine has seen her daughter develop significantly at the day care. Lily is happy to go and a little reluctant to leave in the evenings, Jovine said.\n\u201cThis is how I know she\u2019s in good hands. She likes it there,\u201d she said.\nA scholarship program\nIn addition to offering ratings of the state\u2019s child care providers, Maryland expanded its child care scholarship program in 2022, making it easier to afford child care, said Heather Harding, coordinator at the Federalsburg Judy Center in Caroline County.\u00a0\nBut providers said the scholarship program doesn\u2019t work as well in practice as it does in theory.\nThe eligibility requirements for the scholarship program allow middle class families to apply. Any family of two making less than $61,222 per year is eligible; for a family of four, the limit is $104,438.\u00a0\nA new fast-track program, launched on July 1, 2023, aims to reduce the wait time for parents to receive approval for a scholarship. Three days after applying, eligible families can get 60 days of child care paid for while their long-term aid application is processed. Scholarship values each year can range from $9,000 to $25,000 per child.\nLent, of the Maryland Family Network, said the new fast-track has vastly improved the scholarship program. Previously, parents would be placed on a waiting list to receive help with their child care expenses, he said.\u00a0\nBut other requirements can make the system a catch-22, Harding said. Parents are required to be enrolled in school or working to be eligible for the scholarship, she said. But many of them can\u2019t do either unless they have child care guaranteed.\n\u201cEven if they find it, then they can\u2019t pay for it till they get the scholarship,\u201d Harding said.\nThese scholarships can only be used in facilities that are enrolled in the EXCELS program. After parents receive a voucher from the state, they present it to the provider. The provider then has to send paperwork to the state in order to be paid.\nGarey, the child care provider from Dundalk, said this is one of the most frustrating parts about the process. Multiple times, she filed paperwork and had to wait three months to be paid. At one point, the state owed her $15,000 in scholarship pay. This happened after the state moved to an advance-payment system that was supposed to provide providers with income more quickly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this delay after delay after delay,\u201d Garey said.\nShe finds ways to deal with the months-late payments because she refuses to make the parents pay or to drop families from her list of clients.\n\u201cOne little girl is nonverbal. She sang and pointed to every single letter of the alphabet,\u201d Garey said. \u201cI did that. So why in the world would I drop that family?\u201d\nOther providers also complain about late scholarship payments. Christine Morris, the director of Trinity Lutheran Christian School and Early Learning Center in Joppa, in Harford County, said this spring that the state owed her $40,000 in scholarship payments. And Shantel Rouzer, who runs Happy Feet Enrichment Childcare Center in Baltimore City, said she turned away students on the scholarship program because she knows the state\u2019s reimbursements will come so late.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the families\u2019 fault, but (Maryland State Department of Education officials) don\u2019t hear us!!!?? And providers are tired!!!\u201d Rouzer wrote in response to a survey from the Local News Network.\nSolving her own problem\nParents like Jovine don\u2019t always know about the scholarship program. When she found out about the program in February, months after Lily, her youngest daughter, started day care, Jovine applied. A day later, the program\u2019s new fast-track program started temporarily covering her child care costs for two months.\n\u201cIt took a huge load, And it\u2019s amazing to have that option,\u201d she said.\nBefore that, Jovine was paying $1,360 per month for child care for Lily. On top of that, she had to provide snacks, milk, lunch and other resources to the center.\nBut four days before Jovine\u2019s temporary aid expired, she hadn\u2019t gotten a final decision from the state. Jovine didn\u2019t receive a response until June. By then, she was already paying out of pocket.\u00a0\u00a0\nShe\u2019ll have to continue to do so because the state decided she was earning too much money to qualify. Noting her application listed extra money from her old job at D.C. Public Schools that doesn\u2019t reflect what she\u2019s making now, she has reapplied.\nJovine and her longtime partner, Abdul Dopson, now need child care more than ever. Their third child, Mia, was born on June 14.\u00a0\nKnowing infant spots are difficult to find, Jovine decided to leave her teaching job \u2014 and do her own small part to alleviate Maryland\u2019s child care shortage.\u00a0\n\u201cI got licensed to start a day care myself: a home day care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe need is that prevalent, you know, I might as well try to open up a day care myself and see what happens.\u201d\nJovine\u2019s fledgling child care facility, Elite Kidz Clubhouse, opens in August \u2014 but it\u2019s already overtaken her home\u2019s living room and dining room. She\u2019s spent more than $2,500 on cots, desks, developmentally appropriate toys and other necessities.\nA large, colorful tree painted on the wall of the facility showcases the skills Jovine wants her students to get out of their day-to-day activities. Jovine said she wants her facility to work its way through the EXCELS system and eventually qualify as a preschool under the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, the state\u2019s education reform plan.\n\u201cWhy not start this beautiful generation how it should, educating them and giving them what they need to be successful little children?\u201d she said.\nLocal News Network reporter Laura Shaughnessy contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Maryland and the nation face a severe shortage of childcare slots, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many parents struggling to find care for their children. Maryland lost 15% of its childcare providers and nearly 7% of its slots from January 2020 to January 2024, with some counties experiencing even more dramatic declines.",
    "content": "Halfway through her 12-week maternity leave last summer, Sarah Haddaway didn\u2019t expect the trouble that would accompany her search for child care.\nAfter unexpected rejections from one fully booked child care facility after another, the lifelong resident of Maryland\u2019s western panhandle began calling every provider she could find.\nAlmost 11 months later, Haddaway\u2019s son Brooks \u2014 who just turned 1 \u2014 is on at least seven providers\u2019 waitlists. He\u2019s been on those waitlists since the end of July 2023.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d said Haddaway, who is from Frostburg, in Allegany County. \u201cThere is no opening anywhere you look. It\u2019s like winning the lottery.\u201d\nParents across Maryland and the nation face the same struggle for one simple reason: the number of children who need child care exceeds the number of slots available in child care facilities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse. Maryland lost 15% of its child care providers and nearly 7% of its child care slots from Jan. 1, 2020, through Jan. 1, 2024, according to state statistics retrieved by the Local News Network. Those stats show that the number of child care slots in Maryland fell by 15,152 in those four years.\n\nSome Maryland counties experienced especially dramatic changes. St. Mary\u2019s County, in Southern Maryland,\u00a0 lost more than a quarter of its providers. Caroline County, on the Eastern Shore, lost nearly a quarter of its child care slots.\nIn other words, in many parts of Maryland and the nation, child care has gone missing. In this project, the Local News Network details how and why it happened and what can be done about it. Included is a county-by-county-look at child care trends, which readers can access here.\nIt\u2019s not just Maryland families who struggle to find child care. A national survey of 2,000 Americans conducted in November 2023 for Care.com, a company that tries to match families with caregivers, found 65% of families with young children had spent time on child care waitlists.\nMany child care providers nationwide left the business amid the pressures of the pandemic, said Dr. Jay Belsky, a child psychologist and professor of human development at the University of California, Davis. He said that\u2019s one reason why families struggle to find child care in a nation that, unlike many others, doesn\u2019t offer consistent federal support for it.\n\u201cWhat COVID showed us was how fragile the child care system was,\u201d Belsky said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a child care system. We have a non-system.\u201d\n\u2018Super, super difficult\u2019\nChild care providers closed their doors in recent years for a variety of reasons tied to one central fact: their work is harder now. In a Local News Network survey of 256 current child care providers in Maryland, 62.5% said their jobs have become more difficult since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAsked to cite the challenges they face, 57.4% of child care providers listed financial stability, while 48% cited burdensome state regulations \u2014 issues that are connected, according to many providers. Meanwhile, 46.5% of the providers surveyed said they struggled to hire quality staff.\nChild care providers who left the business in recent years echoed those concerns.\nBen Stelle founded Kidpower at Silver Spring International in 2003 under a contract with Montgomery County that allowed him to work directly out of a school.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super, super, super difficult to turn a profit if you don\u2019t have the kind of sweetheart deal that I had,\u201d Stelle said. \u201cUnless you were getting subsidized and had your own sort of small monopoly on a school area, you were out of luck.\u201d\u00a0\nHe attributed this mostly to Maryland state regulations, which require that child care centers have one adult employee for every three children under the age of 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t turn a profit because you couldn\u2019t stay affordable at the ratios that were being forced upon you,\u201d Stelle said.\nRaven Hill, a spokeswoman for the Maryland State Department of Education \u2014 which oversees child care in the state \u2014 said there\u2019s a good reason the state requires more staff to supervise the youngest children.\n\u201cThe 1:3 staff-to-child ratio for infants ensures that children receive high-quality care and activities,\u201d Hill said. \u201cYounger children typically need more care and attention, and smaller group sizes allow adults to interact more easily with each child and respond to their unique individual needs.\u201d\nStelle decided to leave the child care business, ending his contract with the county before the end of the 2021 school year, for reasons other than state regulations. He said he was fatigued after decades of working with children.\n\u201cThe glamor of it wore off,\u201d he said.\nCandace Hall, who operated a child care facility out of her home in Montgomery County, cited a different reason for why she closed her operation in 2021.\n\u201cThe last licensor specialist I had was extremely rude and demeaning,\u201d Hall said in response to the Local News Network survey. \u201cI decided after that last inspection, I would have to close down as I will not be disrespected in my own home.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Maxine Seidman \u2014 who owned and operated Play Keepers Inc. out of a school in Randallstown for 40 years \u2014 said her income fell as the pandemic prompted parents to keep their children at home. Some of her staffers left, too.\u00a0\n\u201cCertainly none of us were making the kind of money we were making before, which wasn\u2019t a whole heck of a lot before,\u201d Seidman said. \u201cBut this made it very difficult to get staff after COVID.\u201d\u00a0\nThe struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic was unlike anything she had experienced.\n\u201cIt was very distressing,\u201d she said.\nSeidman decided to retire in 2021. But now she\u2019s concerned about the availability of child care in Baltimore County, which state statistics show lost 1,821 child care slots between the start of 2020 and the start of 2024.\n\u201cI worry about some of the families,\u201d Seidman said. \u201cWho is taking care of their children? I wonder where those children are.\u201d\nA frustrating search\nMany Maryland parents also wonder where the child care providers are.\nNoor Shakeel said she knew finding child care in Montgomery County would be a struggle.\n\u201cI was always stressed out, hearing from my friends\u2019 experiences,\u201d said Shakeel, who lives in Germantown.\nTo alleviate that stress, Shakeel\u2019s parents cared for her son until he was 18 months old. At that point, she could tell he wanted and needed more socialization.\nShakeel and her husband tried to keep an open mind when they started touring child care centers, but she came across obstacles.\n\u201cDistance, safety and money,\u201d Shakeel said. \u201cThose are the three big factors.\u201d\nThe process is also long, she said.\n\u201cIt comes to a point when you don\u2019t have a choice other than to settle,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nEventually, Shakeel\u2019s mother-in-law connected them to a family friend who happened to have an opening in her in-home day care.\u00a0\n\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Shakeel said.\nOther parents are not as fortunate.\nMasha Mukhina, an assistant professor of physics at the University of Maryland, moved to Prince George\u2019s County in 2023. Colleagues advised her to add her son, who is now almost 2 years old, to the waitlist for Bright Horizons, a child care center in College Park affiliated with the university.\u00a0\nMuch to her surprise, her son continues to be on the waitlist and has even dropped down a few spots due to aging out of the infant group into the toddler group.\n\u201cChildren move from this waiting list in and out based on age, and I\u2019m supposed to be on the priority list as an employee of the university,\u201d said Mukhina, who ended up hiring a nanny to care for her son. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it gets me any priority because everyone, more or less, on that waiting list is in the same position.\u201d\nSeveral child care providers said availability is especially tight for families seeking care for children under the age of 2.\n\u201cBecause of the regulations and because of the guidelines that surround children under the age of 2, many of the providers and centers are no longer taking infants, which is making it harder to find infant care or child care for children under 2 throughout the state of Maryland, not just Baltimore,\u201d said Brenda Velez-Jimenez, who operates Brenda\u2019s Little Monkey Daycare in Catonsville, in Baltimore County.\nA continuing struggle\nAs difficult as it is for families to find quality child care now, some providers across Maryland fear the situation will get worse before it gets better.\nFor one thing, the federal government offered temporary aid totaling about $24 billion to prop up the child care industry during the pandemic. That program expired in September 2023.\nOn top of that, several providers noted they face new competition from unlicensed providers that popped up during the pandemic and operate without the same costly restrictions imposed by state regulations.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got other children\u2019s neighbors that are providing unlicensed care,\u201d Velez-Jimenez said.\nVelez-Jimenez criticized the state for not doing anything about those unlicensed providers, but Hill, the Maryland State Department of Education spokeswoman, begged to differ.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Office of Child Care investigates all illegal child care complaints within 10 days of receipt,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cA cease-and-desist letter is issued to providers informing them that they must stop providing child care if they are doing so.\u201d\nOther child care providers expressed fears about another new competitor: the new state pre-K program for 3- and 4-year-olds to be implemented over the next few years under the state\u2019s education reform plan, the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future.\u00a0\nWhile private child care providers are being counted on to join the pre-K program, some worry they will lose clients \u2014 and income \u2014 once the state starts offering free pre-K to 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\u201cWe are terrified that if we lose our 3- and 4-year-olds, you\u2019re going to see centers closing down right and left because there won\u2019t be enough income to support the teachers who work there,\u201d\u00a0 said Flora Gee, pedagogical administrator at the Greenbelt Children\u2019s Center in Prince George\u2019s County.\nGee said her facility has already been losing teachers to public schools that pay twice as much, and she isn\u2019t the only child care provider who worries about staff shortages.\n\u201cFinding and retaining competent employees who align with my day care facility\u2019s values and standards is a constant challenge,\u201d said Yvette Gordon, who runs a family child care facility in Baltimore City.\nKelli Deist, who runs an in-home day care in Frostburg, in Allegany County, said there\u2019s an obvious reason for child care staffing shortages.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get paid what we deserve,\u201d she said.\nDuring the pandemic, the state permitted Deist to take in children of essential workers in exchange for state compensation.\u00a0\n\u201cFinancially, it was a struggle because we weren\u2019t allowed to charge the parents,\u201d she said. \u201cThe state was supposed to be paying us, but because it was such a big, new thing, they were way behind. I went three months without any payment at all.\u201d\nA nationwide problem\nMaryland\u2019s child care shortage is part of a nationwide phenomenon. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as many as 100,000 Americans have been forced to stay home from work because of their struggles to find child care.\u00a0\n\u201cThis burden falls disproportionately on women of color who are on the frontlines of many essential jobs,\u201d said Tina Kauh, a senior program officer and child care expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \u201cMany are also child care providers who face the monumental feat of juggling their low-wage, high-risk jobs with caring for their families and themselves in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d\u00a0\nWith child care slots in such high demand, parents end up paying more and more. Care.com in 2023 found families responding to its survey spent 24% of their income on child care \u2014 even though the federal government considers child care affordable if it takes up 7% or less of a family\u2019s income.\nFamilies spent an average of $321 a week on day care, up 13% from $284 in 2022, and many families are going into debt to pay child care bills.\n\u201cWithin the first five years of their child\u2019s life, parents are being forced into a financial hole that is nearly impossible to climb out of,\u201d Care.com CEO Brad Wilson said in a statement announcing the study\u2019s findings.\u00a0\nThe United States is unusual among developed nations in that it has no universal support system for child care or standardized policy on parental leave. Maryland offers a scholarship program that helps subsidize the cost of child care for lower-income families, but it does not cover the full cost.\nBelsky, of the University of California, Davis, said he believes there should be a system in place that gives parents a choice to stay home to raise their children if they want, or to be able to choose a high-quality care facility.\n\u201cGiving families with young children more support, including economic support, might afford them the ability to more freely choose what they feel is best for their young children\u2019s care,\u201d Belsky said.\nBut for families where both parents work, stable child care is a necessity, Belsky said.\n\u201cEspecially at younger ages, stability of care is preferable, desirable, if only from the standpoint of quality of life,\u201d he said.\nThat stability is important for kids and parents alike, according to Natasha Cabrera, a University of Maryland expert on human development.\n\u201cThe first five years of life [and] the first year of life is critically important for brain development,\u201d said Cabrera, a professor at UMD\u2019s College of Education. \u201cChildren are like sponges. Their brains are ready, and they\u2019re wired to learn, but they need the cognitive stimulation from the environment.\u201d\nThe child care shortage could have negative consequences for children across Maryland, such as decreased trust, lowered academic success or increased risk for developing a mental illness, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary. If you care about the future of Maryland, you need to invest in its children.\u201d\u00a0\nLocal News Network reporters Fiona Flowers and Jess Daninhirsch contributed to this report.",

The first reason was the onset of the COVID pandemic, when, just like people from all walks of life and types of employment, child care workers were fearful for their safety and health, and that of their familles. They opted to take a break from providing care, retired completely from the field,\\ or switched to another career opportunity. Financial stability was tenuous for so many during this time and they had to support their families in whatever way possible. The decline in the number of available providers over that period hasn\u2019t yet rebounded to the pre-pandemic numbers and therefore there is a gap between the number of child care spaces needed and the number of spaces available to meet those needs. The second reason for the lack of available child care, in my opinion, has to do with the increased expectations of providers from state-level agencies without the continued, appropriate support to meet these expectations. These state level agencies want to increase the standards for care, but continually do away with the support systems that are designed to assist providers in reaching those raised standards.\"\n-- Jenna Bloom and Jerry Zremski",

They have reached retirement. MSDE (the Maryland State Department of Education) continues to push requirements on them that they don't want to follow. Children are different today, they are raised in a media world where family time isn't important and they don't have to respect elders. Parents have no respect for providers. Providers don't want to be educators: they would like for child care to go back under human resources and we were only responsible for preparing children socially for school. State scholarships have broken many providers waiting on pay that they seeked out other means of income. Schools are taking our toddlers only leaving us with 2 and unders: we can't compete with free care. Lastly, too many providers see on social media where it's\u00a0very easy to provide care without a license.\"\n-- Jenna Bloom and Jerry Zremski",

    "content": "SALY, Senegal \u2013 A large bubble surrounds two full sized basketball courts in the heart of this beach town just over 50 miles from the country\u2019s capital in Dakar.\nIn the morning and in the evenings approximately 20 young men ages 15-19 years old, train on the courts which feature the National Basketball Association (NBA) logo. These are 20 of the most promising young basketball players on the continent of Africa.\nWhile their days start and end with basketball, what happens in between is just as transformative.\nAcademics are taken seriously here. Students work on classes up to five hours each day. They bring culture and languages from countries throughout Africa.\nMichael Abbott, Head of Educational Programming at the NBA Academy Africa, said that from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm, the young men focus on academics, break for lunch, then return to the classroom at 2:30 pm for another two hours of education before training on the basketball court again to end their day.\nEnglish proficiency is a key for players who hope to attend college in the United States and play in the NBA. Language training is provided through Apex Learning, an English-based online learning platform that is the basis for the education in the academy. This is the same learning platform that is used by many high schools in the United States.\nManuel Barreto Francisco Camboma, 18, of Angola is currently in three classes \u2013 English, math, and French \u2013 though his favorite class at the academy has been Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get the accent, \u201d he said with a smile.\nWhile core courses like math, history, and English are prioritized, the educational staff aims to provide a quality education that focuses life after the academy.\nThe academy aims to equip each student with knowledge they may need if they choose to attend university or play professional basketball in the United States. Discussions around slavery in the United States context come up in U.S. history courses. Abbott said this conversation is particularly important, noting that having the chance to prepare academy players, most of whom are Black, for the racial contexts and dynamics they will experience in the United States is crucial.\nUnderstanding cultural differences also is important for navigating life at the academy. Abbott describes that \u201crace, identity, culture, nationality, all these things come in [to student learning] and it gets very challenging to navigate.\u201d\n\u201cOver here, you have people that are from all around Africa, that speak three different languages,\u201d said Adjaratou Nafissatou \u201cNafi\u201d Mamour Niang, an IT specialist and tutor at the academy. She added that \u201cbeing able to interact with each of them really makes it very special.\u201d\nMamour Niang noted that one of the most important lessons instilled in students: \u00a0\u201cLife is not just all about basketball \u2014 yes it\u2019s very important, but there are so many other things that you can be\u201d\nAbbott had a similar message.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to bounce a ball your whole life \u2013 there\u2019s going to be a point where you can\u2019t shoot anymore\u2026 but you always have the ability and capacity to think.\u201d",

Educators said they\u2019re concerned about the Blueprint\u2019s deadlines, a lack of detailed procedural information and the plan\u2019s overall place in the educational system.\n\u201cImplementing a law as comprehensive as the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future is going to be a herculean effort under the best of circumstances,\u201d Baltimore City Public Schools officials wrote in their May 1 report to the accountability board. \u201cBut combined with the added complexities of pandemic recovery, delays that resulted in extremely limited pre-implementation planning time for districts, and the slow pace of regulations and guidance pertaining to the Blueprint, the challenges are amplified.\u201d\nAssessing the Blueprint\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board will oversee the progress of each public school system in implementing Blueprint initiatives.\nThe board is by law required to:\u00a0\n\nDevelop a plan to fully implement the Blueprint in public school systems, complete with timelines and deadlines.\nMonitor the progress school districts and the state are making regarding the Blueprint by reporting annually on 92 data measures, which collect information on student performance, teacher preparation and outcomes backed by Blueprint funding.\u00a0\nDetermine if changes need to be made to the plan to achieve the plan\u2019s original goals.\nEnsure \u201cExpert Review Teams\u201d of teachers, faculty and staff observe schools and understand how to make recommendations about changing how the plan is implemented.\u00a0\nRelease about a quarter of Blueprint funds each year to school systems that are implementing initiatives properly.\nHire an independent contractor to evaluate the Blueprint\u2019s success.\nEnsure school systems demonstrate at least 75% of funding received per student follows the students to their school.\n\nUnder the law, the accountability board can withhold funding from school systems that fail to implement Blueprint initiatives or show significant student progress.\nThe board holds routine meetings to hear from Marylanders. It also has a series of advisory groups to gather feedback from teachers, parents, students and other stakeholders, according to Laura Stapleton, a board member and chair of the University of Maryland\u2019s Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many moving parts,\u201d Stapleton said. \u201cMany different stakeholders are needed to implement all the various parts of the Blueprint.\u201d\nStretching deadlines\nEvery Maryland public school district is responsible for rolling out Blueprint initiatives and collecting each of the 92 different data measures for the Accountability and Implementation Board to evaluate, Stapleton said.\nBut school district officials said none of that is easy.\n\u201cWith educational reform of this scale, it is difficult to keep up with the constant changes, timelines and work of each pillar,\u201d Carroll County school district leaders said in their May 1 submission to the accountability board.\nJanine Bacquie, Montgomery County Public Schools\u2019 Blueprint implementation coordinator, said her district is straining to properly gather data and implement Blueprint initiatives within allocated deadlines.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling to get the guidance that we need to do the work that we need to do with a short timeline,\u201d Bacquie said. \u201cIf we had another year or two, it\u2019d certainly take some of the pressure off.\u201d\nAll 24 school districts were originally required to submit their final Blueprint implementation plans by March 2024.\u00a0\nBut because the state provided necessary materials \u2014 such as report templates and expectations \u2014 to districts only two months before the March deadline, the submission schedule was revised.\nThe March deadline was changed so it only had to be a 10-page preliminary report, according to Bacquie. The final report deadline was then pushed back to May 1.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board is facing a tough deadline, too. According to Stapleton, an independent contractor is set to perform an evaluation of the Blueprint by October.\u00a0\nBut Stapleton said she hopes the deadline for the evaluation can be pushed back a few years to give the Blueprint\u2019s many initiatives more time to lead to change.\nA slow flow of information\nMeanwhile, Blueprint information seems to move slowly to and through the state\u2019s school districts.\n\u201cBecause the implementation of Blueprint is massive and encompasses the entire district, one of the biggest challenges is communicating with employees the ways in which their work already aligns with the Blueprint,\u201d Prince George\u2019s County school officials said in their March 2024 submission to the accountability board.\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board holds regular meetings on Zoom for anyone to attend. All meetings are held online and published in an online archive for anyone to view.\nBut Javier Valera, a math content specialist at a public middle school in Montgomery County, said he and other teachers have no clue about the depth of information in the Blueprint.\u00a0\nHe said the state should work harder to keep teachers informed.\u00a0\nChanges are coming next year, \u201cand we don\u2019t even know anything about it,\u201d Valera said. \u201cIt is concerning, because we are going to be the ones implementing the plan. \u2026 There should be more transparency and they need to talk with us and let us know what is this about.\u201d\nSparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George\u2019s County, echoed Valera\u2019s sentiments about a need for more details about the Blueprint.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information that definitely needs to be clarified,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cI think it needs to be disseminated in a clear, concise manner where of course our principals are able to understand \u2014 and understand the impact that it has for each school.\u201d\nMembers of the accountability board encourage community members to provide feedback. Principals, parents and teachers are urged to reach out about the Blueprint, Rachel Amstutz, the accountability board\u2019s policy director, said at a principals conference late last year.\n\u201cWe need to hear from the local level what\u2019s happening and what you need,\u201d Amstutz said. \u201cWe need to hear from our parents what\u2019s working for their kids and what isn\u2019t.\u201d\nLingering concerns\nImplementing the Blueprint hasn\u2019t gone exactly as planned so far. Deadlines for criteria and implementation plans have been extended at least three times. And in district-level Blueprint plans submitted this spring, school officials across the state expressed a variety of concerns.\n\u201cFrom funding uncertainties to staffing shortages and delays in receiving critical guidance, the district must navigate various obstacles to ensure the successful execution of Blueprint initiatives,\u201d Caroline County school officials said in their March submission to the accountability board.\nMeanwhile, school officials in Allegany County said workforce issues make implementing the Blueprint a challenge. \u201cSustaining district-level initiatives across all schools is difficult because of staff retirements and turnover rates,\u201d officials wrote in their May 1 report.\nIn their Blueprint update, St. Mary\u2019s County school officials said they are concerned about all the elements of public education the Blueprint ignores. Other crucial parts of the learning experience could see funding cuts as the district strives to meet the Blueprint\u2019s mandates, they said.\n\u201cThe ubiquitous challenge inherent in meeting Blueprint goals is in the fact that the Blueprint is silent on supporting all else, i.e., the arts, athletics, enrichment and after-school programming, transportation, facilities, health care, etc.,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s County school officials wrote. \u201cThese elements of school are necessary and imperative in supporting the whole child.\u201d\nAmid all the concerns, Bacquie, Montgomery County\u2019s Blueprint coordinator, said further delays may be necessary. The rush to complete various measures in the Blueprint could render the plan to reinvent Maryland\u2019s public schools less effective than it could otherwise be, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something where you just come in and say something\u2019s going to change overnight,\u201d Bacquie said. \u201cYou\u2019re changing hearts, thoughts, minds, strategies.\u201d\u00a0\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

Fourth-grade reading scores in Maryland dropped eight points from 2019 to 2022, with Hispanic students experiencing the largest decline.",
    "content": "The results for Maryland\u2019s 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) for grades four and eight reflected a national declining trend that began in 2013 and worsened during the pandemic.\nThe NAEP is a biennial national assessment of fourth and eighth graders in reading and math, and 2022 results indicated that a majority of Maryland fourth and eighth grade students were not proficient in mathematics or reading.\n\u201cWhen you look at trends, not necessarily where they rank in 2022, but just looking at how performance has changed from 2013 to 2022, Maryland seems to be heading in the wrong direction,\u201d said Grady Wilburn, a statistician at the National Center for Education Statistics.\n2022 reading scores down both nationally and in Maryland:\nIn 2022, the average reading score of fourth-grade students in the nation was 216, while Maryland had an average score of 212. The average score for Maryland dropped eight points between 2019 and 2022, while national scores dropped three points.\nIn Maryland, fourth-grade Hispanic students\u2019 average reading scores showed the largest decline from 2019 to 2022, dropping 7%. Those who identify as two or more races showed the next largest at 4%, and Black students\u2019 average reading scores saw an almost 2% decline.\nNationally, the average fourth-grade reading scores showed a 2.5% decline in scores for Black students and an almost 2% decline in scores for Hispanic students from 2019 to 2022.\n\u201cBecause of COVID-19, we saw declines across most states in all grades and subjects, so I think it\u2019s fair to attribute part of the decline from 2019 to 2022 to school closures and disruptions in schools,\u201d said Wilburn.\n\nThe average reading scores for fourth-grade students in Maryland that are eligible for the National School Lunch Program declined almost 5%, while students not eligible showed an almost 3% decline in scores from 2019 to 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the average reading score of eighth-grade students in Maryland was 259, the same average score for students nationally. Maryland\u2019s eighth-grade average scores dropped almost 2% between 2019 and 2022.\nIn Maryland, eighth-grade students who identify as two or more races showed the largest drop in average scores for reading with an almost 6% decline. Black students\u2019 scores dropped by almost 3%, Asian/Pacific Islander students\u2019 scores dropped almost 2%, and white and Hispanic students\u2019 scores dropped less than 1% from 2019 to 2022.\n\nNationally, average eighth-grade scores for white students dropped by 1.5%, Black and Asian/Pacific Islander students\u2019 scores did not change, and scores for Hispanic students and those who identify as two or more races dropped by less than 1%.\n\u201cRegardless of socioeconomic status, everyone seems to be declining,\u201d Wilburn said.\nMathematics scores also declining:\nThe average mathematics score for fourth-grade students in Maryland in 2019 was 239 and dropped to 229 in 2022, almost 3% lower than average national scores\nFrom 2019 to 2022 in Maryland, Hispanic students showed the largest drop in average fourth-grade mathematics scores with an almost 8% decline, Black students\u2019 scores declined almost 5%, Asian/Pacific Islander students\u2019 scores declined just over 3%, and white students\u2019 scores declined by just over 1%.\nThe only group to see an increase in scores was students who identify as two or more races, with scores increasing by 1.6%.\n\nNationally, scores for all racial and ethnic groups declined, with Black students showing the largest decline at just over 3%.\nThe average mathematics scores for fourth-grade students in Maryland that are eligible for the National School Lunch Program declined by just over 6%, and ineligible students\u2019 scores declined by just over 3% from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe average mathematics score of eighth-grade students in Maryland dropped from 280 in 2019 to 269 in 2022, and the average mathematics score for students in the nation was 273.\nIn Maryland, both Black and Hispanic eighth-grade students\u2019 scores dropped the most, declining just over 4%.\n\nNationally, average mathematics scores for eighth-grade students who identify as two or more races declined the most, dropping by 3.5% from 2019 to 2022, and Black and Hispanic students\u2019 scores dropped by just over 2.5%.\nWhile scores have been declining since 2013, the pandemic was a \u201cwakeup call that the education system is struggling,\u201d according to Wilburn.\nIn order to understand where these gaps in learning are coming from, Wilburn says that \u201callowing an opportunity for someone who is good at tutoring, who knows what they\u2019re doing, to help understand where the holes are, and then fill in those holes with some high dosage tutoring,\u201d is a key strategy in helping struggling students.\nIn a 2022 Maryland State Department of Education press release, State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said \u201cthere is no sugar coating these results. Maryland has been experiencing a downward trend since 2013, and a return to normal is not good enough.\u201d\nThe next NAEP tests will be administered in the winter of 2024 in Maryland, with results estimated to come out in the summer of 2025.",

This shift enables elite gymnasts to balance Olympic aspirations with college participation and financial opportunities, marking a significant change from the previous requirement to choose between amateur status for college eligibility or professional earnings.",
    "content": "Sunisa Lee made history in 2021 when she clinched the top spot in the women\u2019s gymnastics individual all-around at the Tokyo Olympics. Along with being the first woman of Asian descent to win the Olympic all-around title, she became the fifth consecutive American to take the coveted spot at the summer games. \nShe\u2019s also the first Olympic all-around gold medalist to compete in NCAA gymnastics, and could earn money through sponsorships and deals in addition to doing college gymnastics.\nIt\u2019s a path that\u2019s now possible after a 2021 Supreme Court decision causing an NCAA rule change to allow athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness, or NIL. \nIn past years, elite gymnasts decided at a young age whether they wanted to pursue the professional route of earning money via sponsorships or maintaining their amateur status for opportunities to receive college athletic scholarships. NCAA rules prohibited professional athletes, so gymnasts couldn\u2019t compete in college if they received money from sponsorships.\nBut now athletes don\u2019t have to choose. The rule change means gymnasts like Lee can profit off their success without forfeiting their NCAA eligibility, competing in college while also earning money from deals and sponsorships.\n\u201cI\u2019m so fortunate to be able to compete at the collegiate level and pursue my business at the same time,\u201d Lee told Forbes in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s huge for athletes who don\u2019t have pro leagues to go on to after college.\u201d\nThe gymnasts representing the U.S. in Tokyo had proportionally more athletes who competed in college than at any other Olympics.\n\n1984 marked the first time the summer games were held since the NCAA introduced women\u2019s gymnastics as a champion sport in 1982.\nSince then, 63 unique athletes have competed in the sport\u2019s biggest stage at the Olympics \u2014 excluding alternates \u2014 and at the collegiate level. These gymnasts retained their amateur status and couldn\u2019t earn money for their Olympic success. \nThe bulk of these competitors represented North American countries: 23 for the United States and 19 for Canada. \n\nTwo Olympic gymnasts competed at the collegiate level for another sport. Amy Chow took on diving at Stanford beginning in 2008 and Phoebe Mills did the same at Miami starting in 1991.\nUCLA\u2019s women\u2019s gymnastics team has the most Olympians by a landslide.\nThe Bruins boast 17 Olympians, eight of whom represented the U.S. It\u2019s nearly twice as many as second-place Stanford, which has nine Olympians \u2014 all of whom were international. \nUCLA has had an athlete who\u2019s competed at nine of the 10 Olympic Games since women\u2019s gymnastics became an NCAA sport.\nThe list includes Kyla Ross and Madison Kocian, who in 2017 became the first Olympic gold medalists to compete at the NCAA level. \n\u201cI just feel like they enrich the program so much,\u201d then-head coach Valerie Kondos Field told ESPN in 2017. \u201cRegardless of what we\u2019re scoring or not scoring, their commitment to the team, their excitement, their enthusiasm for anything we do\u2026 they just have bought in 100 percent.\u201d\n\nLee is vying for one of five spots on the 2024 Olympic team.\nSo is Leanne Wong, a junior at Florida and an alternate in Tokyo. She\u2019s one of three athletes who elected to compete in college this season while also training to represent the U.S. in Paris. It\u2019s her coaches at Florida who travel with her to national team camps, elite meets and international competitions. \nOn top of gymnastics, she balances her classes, business \u2014 she\u2019s the founder and CEO of Leanne Wong Bowtique, a bow and leotard company \u2014 and NIL deals. \n\u201cI really just have to take it day by day and plan out each day, what needs to get done first, and time management,\u201d Wong told Capital News Service.\nAs of January, 13 contenders for the 2024 U.S. Olympic team have ties to college gymnastics, according to the NCAA. Of these, seven have already competed at the collegiate level, while the other six haven\u2019t entered college but are committed to schools. \nThe country\u2019s strongest prospects face off at the Olympic Team Trials in June. After two days of competition in Minneapolis, USA Gymnastics will determine who heads to Paris.",

    "summary": "Maryland's ambitious Blueprint for education, aimed at significant reforms including expanded pre-K and improved teacher workforce, faces widespread criticism from local school districts over insufficient funding and unrealistic mandates. County officials, like Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly, are calling for a pause and reassessment due to the financial strain on local budgets.",
    "content": "\ufeff\ufeff\nYou might think spending $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 through 2029 \u2014 and billions more after that \u2014 would be enough to give Maryland a world-class education system. But that\u2019s not what many people at the state\u2019s local school districts think.\nFor proof, look at what local district leaders said in March when they updated state officials on efforts to implement the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, the state\u2019s landmark effort to rebuild its public schools.\n\u201cThe funding provided under the Blueprint is not sufficient to meet all of the requirements,\u201d officials in the Baltimore City Public School System wrote.\n\u201cBlueprint funding tied to specific programs for expansion requires the elimination of other programs and supports,\u201d the St. Mary\u2019s County Public School System\u2019s report said.\nMeanwhile, in Kent County, school officials bemoaned that the district will see increased costs related to staffing, data systems, student support and transportation. \u201cKCPS has found that many of the requirements of the Blueprint come without subsequent funding sources to sufficiently cover full implementation,\u201d district officials wrote.\nCreated by legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint is built on five pillars: expanding pre-K to all 4-year-olds and low-income 3-year-olds, improving the teacher workforce, changing curriculums statewide to prepare students for college and careers, expanding funding and setting up a state agency to oversee it all.\nBut in those March updates, 15 of the state\u2019s 24 school districts listed funding or resource allocations among the three central challenges they face under the Blueprint.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, some county officials \u2014 such as Harford County Executive Bob Cassilly \u2014 say the Blueprint is unaffordable.\n\u201cUnrealistic state spending mandates for the Blueprint for Education are straining local budgets statewide and should be paused and revisited,\u201d Cassilly said as he unveiled the county\u2019s latest budget April 15.\u00a0\nNew mandates\nWhile dramatically boosting state funding for public education over a decade, the Blueprint also asks local school districts \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 to do their part. And that is causing some concern among the state\u2019s school principals, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\u00a0\n\u201cIn education, one thing that sometimes happens is we get unfunded mandates, and unfunded mandates are very challenging,\u201d Kaufman said at a principals conference late last year.\nCounty leaders find the mandates challenging, too. In a letter to Gov. Wes Moore \u2014 a Democrat and strong supporter of the Blueprint \u2014 the Maryland Association of Counties last November listed a litany of concerns. They said the Blueprint\u2019s cost estimates don\u2019t take into account the bottom-line local impact of several major spending items, including:\n\nConstruction costs for additional classrooms needed under the plan\u2019s expansion of pre-K.\nClassroom modifications to accommodate instructional changes called for under the Blueprint plan to expand career and technical education.\nAdditional staffing for special education students and English language learners.\nThe new minimum $60,000 teacher salary starting in 2026 and other efforts to construct a \u201ccareer ladder\u201d for Maryland teachers.\n\nNoting that local education funding has already reached all-time highs, the Maryland Association of Counties said: \u201cThis record county funding, combined with greater funding requirements mandated by the law, will limit counties\u2019 ability to fund competing governmental needs at basic operational levels.\u201d\nThe Blueprint\u2019s burden on local school districts is only beginning to be felt. By 2034, local school districts will be expected to pay $700 million more annually than they would if the Blueprint hadn\u2019t been adopted, a 2022 state report projected.\n\u201cAs the Blueprint ramps up and the formulas increase, more and more counties will have to put more funds in because the local share will increase,\u201d said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board, the statewide agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \u201cWe\u2019re just in the early first couple of years of Blueprint implementation. So it\u2019s only four or five counties that are required to put in more than they have been. But over time, it will be more than half of them.\u201d\nTrouble in the counties\nTo hear county officials tell it, though, the Blueprint\u2019s mandates are already leaving them in a pinch.\nWhen the Blueprint began its rollout, Dorchester County saw a $3 million jump in local funding contributions, according to County Council President Lenny Pfeffer.\n\u201cThat $3 million jump was devastating to us,\u201d Pfeffer said. \u201cWe had to pull from every resource and cut some programs that we wanted to do as far as highway maintenance, bridge maintenance and other things like that.\u201d\u00a0\nMeanwhile in Cecil County, a school funding battle tied in part to the Blueprint led to the creation of a Facebook group \u2014 Fund CCPS \u2014 with 6,700 members.\nCecil County Executive Danielle Hornberger, a Republican, has refused to meet the school district\u2019s funding request. And last month, Hornberger filed an ethics complaint against Cecil County Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson, accusing him of using public property and funds for political purposes in the budget battle.\n\u201cCCPS families deserve better,\u201d Hornberger said.\nThat prompted an angry response from Allison Stoudt, the Rising Sun High School senior who founded the Fund CCPS Facebook group. Noting that the county has funded local schools \u201cat the legal minimum\u201d for three years running and that its current budget proposal falls $13 million short of the $17 million in additional local aid the district is seeking, Stoudt called Hornberger\u2019s accusation against Lawson \u201cshameful.\u201d\nIn Worcester County, the county government has similarly refused to increase school funding above the state requirement minimums, leading to a $9 million cash shortfall that could force the district to trim between 90 and 100 staff positions.\n\u201cIt is WCPS\u2019 belief that drastically cutting instructional staff runs contrary to the spirit of the Blueprint\u2019s goals of continual improvement and transformation in education,\u201d district officials said in their March Blueprint update.\nShifting resources\nThe Blueprint also calls for shifting resources within school districts at the expense of other schools.\nCarroll County Public Schools Superintendent Cynthia McCabe explained the potential ramifications of that change at a public meeting in Sykesville last year.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to be is a fearmonger, but I also don\u2019t want to get to September of 2024 and have parents calling me saying, \u2018Why are the class sizes so much bigger in my child\u2019s school this year?\u2019\u201d McCabe said during the presentation.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint shifts funding to higher-need schools in several ways.\u00a0\nThe education reform plan provides \u201cconcentration of poverty\u201d grants to some schools to bolster support for academics, extracurriculars, and mental and physical health. Grants are given to schools based on the number of students receiving free and reduced-price meals. In this fiscal year, 454 schools in Maryland received concentration of poverty grants, with just over one- fourth given to schools in Baltimore City.\u00a0\n\u201cEspecially the community where I serve within my district, they\u2019ve benefited greatly from having concentrations of poverty funding,\u201d said Ashley Moore, principal at the Empowerment Academy, a charter school in Baltimore City.\u00a0\nIn addition, a new requirement under the Blueprint requires students who qualify for Medicaid to automatically be enrolled in free and reduced-price school meals.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is an improvement from the standpoint of feeding kids,\u201d said Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy.\u00a0\nBut shifting resources to the schools that need them leads to ramifications elsewhere.\nIn Baltimore County, for example, average class sizes will go from 25 to 24 in grades 1-3 starting in the fall,\u00a0 but middle school class sizes will grow from 20 to 22 while high school class sizes will increase from 21 to 23.\nAt a February media briefing, Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Myriam Rogers said elementary school class sizes have been reduced under the Blueprint because making sure students can read by third grade \u201chas been proven time and time again to be an indicator of success.\u201d In addition, she noted that fifth-graders must pass state tests on reading and math.\nAsked if the larger class sizes in other grades could negatively impact students, Rogers replied: \u201cNo,\u201d saying district officials were being careful in how they were planning to adjust class sizes.\nBut McCabe, the Carroll County superintendent, reiterated her concern about class-size adjustments called for under the Blueprint.\n\u201cWe are concerned that very large class sizes will be detrimental to student learning,\u201d McCabe said in an email. \u201cAs we are seeing increased mental health concerns in our student population. It is essential that teachers have a manageable class size in order to meet the varied needs of students.\u201d\nThe future\nThe Blueprint\u2019s long rollout period \u2014 along with the nation\u2019s post-pandemic bout with inflation \u2014 could pose other financial concerns to local school districts.\nMapping out the potential district-level impact of the Blueprint in 2022, the Maryland State Department of Legislative Services projected that 15 of the state\u2019s 24 school districts would have to increase local funding levels at some point before the Blueprint rollout is complete in 2034.\n\u201cThe impacts are not uniform \u2026 leading several counties to need to make significant increases in their local appropriation to the boards of education in the early years, later years, or both,\u201d the state report said. \u201cOther county governments are forecast to spend about the same or slightly more than they would have otherwise.\u201d\nOf course, inflation could impact those projections. Meyer, the research analyst with the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, noted the Blueprint\u2019s cost projections were made before prices skyrocketed at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cActual costs in the economy have gone way up, but the funding amounts that are required under state law haven\u2019t,\u201d Meyer said.\nThat being the case, it\u2019s possible that some of the funding requirements in the Blueprint may be changed at some point, either by the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board or the General Assembly.\n\u201cNo law is ever perfect,\u201d Maryland Education Coalition co-chair Rick Tyler Jr. said. \u201cWe\u2019re still early in the process of what is intended to be a 10-year process.\u201d\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Maryland's Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future includes hiring career counselors in all high schools to help students plan their future paths, with an ambitious goal of preparing all high school students for college or career by the end of 10th grade. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of education, involving curriculum redesigns and increased emphasis on dual enrollment and technical education programs.",
    "content": "Northern High School had never had a career counselor. Not until Christian Wargo walked through its doors.\nIn September, Wargo became the Calvert County high school\u2019s first career advisor as a part of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, a multi-billion dollar legislative plan to improve education across the state.\nNow, every school district across the state is hiring career counselors like Wargo to help students navigate a pressing question: What do they want to do when they grow up?\nWargo said his help is in high demand.\n\u201cI\u2019m in the classrooms a lot with the kids still introducing myself so they know who I am, but I\u2019m starting to have a lot of students come to me on their own,\u201d he said.\nA new emphasis on career counseling is just part of the Blueprint\u2019s college and career readiness \u201cpillar,\u201d which starts with an ambitious goal: to make sure all high school students are prepared for their next steps after high school by the end of the 10th grade.\nMany students fall short of that goal now, and Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board, said that leaves educators with an important lesson.\n\u201cThe bulk of kids need something different than what we\u2019re doing for them now,\u201d Hise said.\nThat \u201csomething different\u201d is already taking shape amid the state\u2019s education bureaucracy and at its 1,421 or so public schools. The State Department of Education is redesigning curriculums and has already revised how to measure college and career readiness. Districts are funneling more high school juniors and seniors to dual enrollment programs at local community colleges, and schools are placing a far stronger emphasis on career and technical education.\nA sweeping curriculum overhaul\u00a0\nAll Blueprint changes need to be in place by the 2031-2032 school year. While each school district is tasked with developing its own implementation plan, one key to the Blueprint is a \u201cmodel statewide curriculum\u201d that\u2019s currently under development.\n\u201cWe are trying to get rid of our gaps and to really understand what we need to do to meet our kids to make sure that they leave us prepared for college, career and life,\u201d said Rachel Amstutz, policy director for the Accountability and Implementation Board that\u2019s overseeing the Blueprint rollout.\nWhile it\u2019s not yet clear what those changes might entail, the Blueprint Implementation Plan discusses possible adjustments to math, English language arts, science and social studies curriculums to align with local college admissions standards and research on student learning.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear us talk about reimagining the school day,\u201d Amstutz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t envision high school looking like what high school has looked like since my parents were in school.\u201d\nThe Blueprint also requires a universal standard to measure college and career readiness. The state had been using Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores, a state standardized test, as an indicator of success. By 10th grade, students need to meet expectations in English language arts and math to be deemed \u201ccareer and college ready.\u201d\nBut the test results from the 2020-21 school year, the latest available, showed just over half of students (53.5%) met the English language arts requirements and roughly 40% passed math standards by 10th grade. Maryland high schoolers have to take the test to graduate, but aren\u2019t required by the state to pass. However, starting this year the government and life science tests will count for 20% of a student\u2019s course grade.\nStudies commissioned by the Blueprint found that including an alternative to demonstrating college and career readiness through passing exams, such as earning a 3.0 GPA, was more inclusive than standardized tests alone and better predicted student success in college.\u00a0\nThat being the case, the State Board of Education in January unanimously adopted a new set of college and career readiness standards last month that includes that GPA measure as an alternative to test scores.\nNow it\u2019s up to teachers, career counselors and students to try to meet those standards.\n\u201cThe Blueprint is really asking us to rethink what high school looks like and really make sure that we\u2019re preparing all of our students to go to college or enter the workforce in a way that we just haven\u2019t done before,\u201d said Sarah Bento, assistant principal at Northern High School in Calvert County.\nCollege Prep: AP Classes and Dual Enrollment\nThe requirement to add career counselors in every school means students will have more support to think about what they want to do. For many, that still means pursuing a college degree.\nOn average, roughly half of Maryland high school graduates go straight to college after high school.\nNorthern High School sophomore Simon Mackenzie Dean, 15, is one such student planning on going to college. He knew he liked math and science, and after speaking with Wargo, he decided to go either into nuclear engineering or quantum physics.\n\u201cWe had the resources to look at more job opportunities, what it does, how it works and sort of that stuff,\u201d Dean said. \u201cAnd it made me think more about it. Even just having the ability to do that [is helpful], so you can narrow it down more.\u201d\nFor high school students interested in college, options such as AP classes or dual-enrollment at community colleges help them prepare for that next step and can defray the costs of earning a four-year degree.\nLast year, about one in 15 Maryland high schoolers participated in dual enrollment programs at local colleges.\nThe Blueprint requires local community colleges to accept 11th- and 12th- graders who meet college and career readiness standards and requirements for dual enrollment tuition-free.\nCareer counselors can also help students make informed decisions about where to go to school, what to study and how to pay for it, said Carrie Akins, director of Career and Technical Education at Calvert County Public Schools.\n\u201cI think people have been hungry for that knowledge for quite some time, but as parents, what they knew was, \u2018I don\u2019t want my kid to have thousands of dollars in debt, but I don\u2019t know what to tell them,\u2019\u201d Akins said. \u201cSo I think that they\u2019re very excited to now have somebody that can help their child through that process.\u201d\nAlternatives to a Four-Year Degree\nThe Blueprint also requires increasing career preparation opportunities for students who won\u2019t end up going to college. The Blueprint aims to have 45% of high school graduates completing an apprenticeship or industry-recognized credential by the 2030-31 school year.\nThat\u2019s a lofty goal. Current state data show that, as of February 2023, 27% of high school students had completed a career and technical education program. However, just 7% had earned an industry credential or completed an apprenticeship.\nHigh schools in Garrett, Somerset, Kent and Caroline counties currently have the highest participation rates in career and technical education, while Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties have the lowest, State Department of Education data show.\nState-approved career and technical education programs include health professions, early childhood education, dental hygienist and dental assisting, culinary arts, carpentry, cosmetology, air traffic control and many other career training options.\nThe key to getting students to consider such careers involves reaching them young and debunking some old stereotypes, educators said.\n\u201cWe really should be starting a conversation of college and career at the K through eight level,\u201d said Ryan Daniel, principal of Fort Foote Elementary School in Prince George\u2019s County.\nSuch conversations can make a big difference. Northern High School freshman Cody Bach Du, 14, wanted to either go to college for landscaping architecture or go to the Calvert County Career and Technology Academy for woodworking or welding. Talking with Wargo made Duhim realize there were other pathways to sustainable careers outside of a four-year degree.\n\u201cWhen Mr. Wargo came in and he told me about all of these different opportunities, it kind of opened my view up,\u201d Du said.\u00a0\nGiven the historical emphasis on a four-year college education, there can be a lingering stigma for students who want to enter the workforce out of high school or opt for job training instead.\n\u201cWe still need to make sure that we\u2019re doing a better job, really, taking some of that stigma away,\u201d said Chrystie Crawford-Smick, president of the Harford County Education Association, a bargaining union for local education employees. \u201cThey\u2019re very lucrative careers and very needed.\u201d\nNikki Phillips, the new advisor at Plum Point Middle School in Calvert County, said some students come to her with a set idea of what success looks like based on perceptions they learn from their parents.\nBecause older generations were taught that earning a four-year degree was the best path to success, part of the job now involves educating parents on today\u2019s career landscape, especially with factors such as artificial intelligence and automation, Akins said.\nIt\u2019s a slightly different conversation than the one Phillips has with younger students.\n\u201cWhen we talk about anything in the future, they\u2019re like, \u2018I want to be rich,\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0\nInstead of getting her students to focus on how much money they will make, however, she said she tries to get them to focus on other things, like the quality of life with each job.\n\u201cAre you willing to put in the effort to get there?\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBecause, no matter what the job is, you still have to go through the effort to get there.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland faces a significant teacher shortage, with 28 subject areas lacking educators this year, up from 17 five years ago; the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future aims to address this by improving pay and training, but experts believe that recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers remains the primary challenge.",
    "content": "Fifth-grade teacher Melissa Carpenter works a 10-hour day on average during the week, and her job sometimes requires her to put in hours on weekends, too.\n\u201cI feel like teaching is one of those jobs where we go to work to do more work \u2014 to do work after work,\u201d said Carpenter, who teaches at William B. Wade Elementary School in Waldorf, in Charles County.\nCarpenter\u2019s long hours are far from unique among Maryland\u2019s educators, as the state and nation grapple with a teacher shortage.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Department of Education keeps a Teacher Shortage Areas database \u2014 and it found that for the current school year, Maryland was short of teachers in 28 subjects, which the state defines as \u201careas of certification.\u201d That\u2019s up from 17 five years earlier. Some teacher certification areas \u2014 such as English as a second language, health science and special education \u2014 are short on teachers from pre-K through the 12th grade.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future \u2013 a landmark state law reforming public education \u2014 aims to fix that problem by \u201celevating the stature of the teaching profession\u201d through higher pay, better training and stronger recruitment efforts.\nHowever, experts and educators have mixed views about whether that will successfully address the root causes of the shortage.\n\u201cMoney is a huge help, but it\u2019s not everything,\u201d said Simon Birenbaum, director of grading, assessment and scheduling at Baltimore City Public Schools. \u201cHuman capital is the biggest issue, and money can help with that problem, but recruiting, training and retaining high-quality teachers and staff has to be the primary focus. No amount of money can compensate for a lack of highly-skilled educators.\u201d\nDocumenting the shortage\nMaryland\u2019s teacher woes follow national trends. The National Center for Education Statistics reported 86% of U.S. K-12 public schools faced challenges in hiring teachers for the current school year.\nAmid the shortage, the Blueprint calls for hiring an unspecified number of additional teachers to ease the workload of classroom veterans.\n\u201cYou hear a lot about the teacher shortage \u2014 and how are we going to implement all these Blueprint programs, which require additional staffing, when we have a teacher shortage?\u201d asked Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\nShortages stem, in part, from the fact that teachers are leaving the profession. In Prince George\u2019s County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023 \u2014 up from 989 the previous year, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, 625 resigned in Montgomery County Public Schools, up from 576 a year earlier.\nDorchester County experienced the highest attrition rate in Maryland during the 2021-22 school year at 18%, according to a Department of Education report.\n\u201cI used to never have people just quit in the middle of the year,\u201d said Dorchester County Superintendent Dave Bromwell, who recently retired. \u201cThe pandemic told some people, you know what? If you\u2019re not happy, move on.\u201d\nAll those factors end up impacting teachers like Carpenter. She said her grade level saw an influx of students, with around 30 students in her own fifth grade class this year.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cOur class sizes are growing, and we don\u2019t have the support in place to help some of our struggling learners,\u201d she said.\n\u2018Teaching isn\u2019t approved\u2019\nSchools are suffering from a long-term decline in the number of people interested in becoming teachers.\nThat decline has been ongoing since the mid-\u201870s, \u201cbut it gets worse and worse and worse, year over year,\u201d said Mike Hansen, an education policy expert at the Brookings Institution.\nAccording to the State Department of Education, 9,134 people were enrolled in teacher preparation programs in the state in 2012. That number plummeted by about half by 2017, but rose to 6,037 by 2020.\nWhy is teaching becoming less appealing as a career? Zid Mancenido, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has been studying that issue.\n\u201cOne of the major findings of my research has been that people are taught over time that teaching isn\u2019t a great career,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview on the school\u2019s website. \u201cThere are all these tiny interactions they have over their lifetime that give them this feeling that teaching isn\u2019t approved, that they should be aspiring to other careers that might be more prestigious or well-paid.\u201d\nAmid the shortage, many schools hire less-credentialed \u201cconditional\u201d teachers \u2014 those who have not yet received their professional certifications. Maryland\u2019s issuance of conditional certificates more than doubled between 2018 to 2022, a state Department of Education report said.\n\nIn Charles County, where Carpenter works, 12.4% of all teachers held conditional certificates by 2021\u00a0 \u2013 a rate only surpassed by Baltimore City (13.4%) and Prince George\u2019s County (14.3%).\nCarpenter said experienced teachers are leaned on to help the conditional hires.\n\u201cWhich would be fine if you had one or two teachers who needed that support. But we have a massive amount of teachers who are conditional right now,\u201d she said.\nThe Blueprint\u2019s pay bump\nIn order to address the teacher shortage, the Blueprint provides a number of measures that lawmakers hope will encourage people to become teachers and ensure that existing ones don\u2019t leave for more lucrative out-of-state positions \u2013 or exit the profession altogether.\nA key Blueprint initiative increases teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 by 2026. In some counties, that means a nearly $15,000 pay bump for new teachers.\nDavid Larner, chief human resource and professional development officer at the Howard County Public School System, said the pay raise will attract teachers from other states and build up Maryland\u2019s teacher workforce.\n\u201cIf our salaries are higher than salaries in surrounding states \u2026 then candidates are more likely to come,\u201d Larner explained.\nHowever, Hansen, of the Brookings Institution, expressed skepticism about the likely impact of the measure on the state\u2019s teacher shortage.\u00a0\nHansen argued that rather than a universal rise in minimum salary levels, money should be targeted where it\u2019s needed the most \u2013 attracting teacher talent in high-need schools and specialized fields like STEM subjects and special education. He also highlighted research that suggests salary is just one of many factors that can lead to teacher attrition.\n\u201cI think we need to be paying teachers more \u2013 I don\u2019t think paying a $60,000 minimum wage is the way to do it,\u201d he said.\nBoosting careers and diversity\nThe Blueprint also aims to improve teacher quality by encouraging educators to obtain additional training.\nThe plan provides for a salary increase of $10,000 for teachers who become National Board Certified, an advanced teaching credential that fewer than 6% of Maryland teachers held at the start of 2023, according to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Teachers in high-need areas may see their annual salaries increase by up to $17,000 by becoming certified.\n\u201cWe want to professionalize the career of teaching, and I think that is absolutely what we should be doing,\u201d said Stephanie Novak Pappas, principal of the Holabird Academy, an elementary and middle school in Baltimore.\nHowever, Hansen questioned the Blueprint\u2019s emphasis on National Board certification.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of evidence that actually getting your NBC makes you a better teacher,\u201d Hansen said.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint also calls on school districts to create a diverse workforce. The Accountability and Implementation Board \u2013 which oversees the Blueprint \u2013 will evaluate those efforts.\nA diverse workforce has significant benefits, according to David Blazar, an education policy expert at the University of Maryland.\nBlazar said that increasing the share of Black teachers has \u201cexceptionally large impacts on students\u2019 short and long term outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say some of the largest impacts I\u2019ve seen across all of the educational intervention literature.\u201d\nBut maximizing the benefits of a more diverse workforce will be complicated, Blazar said. Even if the state\u2019s teacher workforce came to match the demographics of its students, there would likely still be \u201cclustering of Black teachers within certain districts, and within certain schools within districts,\u201d he said.\nHansen echoed those concerns, and said that teachers nationwide remain even more racially segregated than students. Rather than aiming to make the teachers within individual districts reflect the exact racial demographics as their students, he suggested that policymakers should \u201cmaximize exposure and access to a diverse set of teachers for every student\u201d across different regions.\nA work in progress\nBeyond the Blueprint, the General Assembly last year passed the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act, which requires the state to set recruitment goals for teacher education programs, creates an alternative teacher prep program for early childhood educators and establishes a $20,000 yearly stipend for eligible student teachers.\nGov. Wes Moore, who proposed the legislation, said upon signing it that it is intended to place \u201cworld class teachers in every classroom.\u201d\nCarpenter, the Charles County teacher, said future changes may be necessary, too.\n\u201cWe will have new students next year, and they will [have] different needs. So we need to make sure that we are constantly evolving,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Sparkle Jefferson, an assistant principal at Flintstone Elementary School in Prince George\u2019s County, stressed that reinforcing the teacher workforce is key to the Blueprint\u2019s overall success.\n\u201cIt lands in the hands of our educators, and if we don\u2019t have educators who are highly qualified or able to do the work, then the Blueprint work would never get accomplished,\u201d she said.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Maryland's Blueprint for Future aims to expand pre-K availability for all 3- and 4-year-olds, emphasizing foundational skills beyond basic academics; however, the plan faces challenges in enlisting private providers and finding space in public schools.",
    "content": "As a group of 4-year-old boys worked to create a towering building block castle in their colorful Montgomery County Public Schools pre-K classroom, Head Start teacher Molly Scherf reminded them it is important to build a strong foundation.\u00a0\nThe boys used their tiny hands to create the tower piece by piece, building the foundation to their castle \u2014 and also for their future education.\u00a0\nWith research showing children who attend pre-K perform better in later years, the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future \u2014 the state\u2019s landmark education plan \u2014 aims to make pre-K much more widely available to every 3- and 4-year-old in the state.\nScherf, who has worked in early childhood education for 30 years, said it\u2019s a great idea.\n\u201c[Pre-K] is not just all about learning the letters of the alphabet or learning how to count to 10, it\u2019s also learning how to get along with your peers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe state\u2019s plan to make pre-K free to low- and moderate-income families and available to all faces some serious struggles, however. The Blueprint relies on a mix of private providers and public schools to expand the availability of pre-K \u2014 but many districts are struggling to enlist enough private providers. On top of that, some public schools that would otherwise host the pre-K population don\u2019t have the room to do so.\nEducators in the state call the Blueprint pre-K plan a \u201cmixed delivery system\u201d that aims to expand pre-K without making it a public school monopoly.\n\u201cSo in theory, it\u2019s a great model,\u201d said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Accountability and Implementation Board, the state agency created to oversee the Blueprint. \u201cIn practice, it has a lot of challenges.\u201d\nA vast expansion\nThe state says 30,718 children were enrolled in pre-K in Maryland during the 2022-23 school year, and that number is expected to expand as the 10-year Blueprint is implemented.\u00a0\nThe Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, which drew up the early childhood education effort incorporated into the Blueprint, estimated the changes it proposed would mean 80% of eligible children would be in pre-K when the plan is fully implemented. That\u2019s a lofty goal considering state figures showed the pre-K participation rate for 4-year-olds was below 50% in half of Maryland\u2019s school districts in 2022-23.\nCosts will increase along with the pre-K population. According to the state\u2019s Department of Legislative Services, Blueprint-related early childhood programs cost the state $445 million in fiscal year 2023 alone. While future cost increases depend largely on enrollment, that department projects a 15.7% increase in funding for pre-K programs between fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\nResearch shows that could be a good investment. William T. Gormley, co-director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Research on Children in the United States, and his colleagues tracked the results of youngsters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for more than 20 years after they left pre-K. The researchers found that while 44% of children who attended pre-K went on to college, only a third of those who missed out on pre-K went on to higher education.\n\u201cIn this respect, early childhood education is indeed the gift that keeps on giving,\u201d Gormley and his colleagues wrote in a 2023 paper.\nThat being the case, Pillar 1 of the Blueprint \u2014 early childhood education \u2014 calls for government-funded pre-K to be available to all low-income 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 fiscal year. Preschool will be free to all 3- and 4-year-olds from families that earn up to 300% of the federal poverty level. Families with incomes between 300% and 600% of the federal poverty level will pay for pre-K on a sliding scale, and higher-income families will pay for it in full.\nInstead of placing all pre-K students in conventional public school classrooms, the plan relies on participation from both public and private child care providers. Preschool classrooms can either be in public schools or other child care facilities.\nThis will create a diverse set of pre-K options that aims to make child care accessible for limited-income families, according to Molly McGriff, senior director of United for Childcare, an initiative of the United Way of Central Maryland that aims to make child care accessible for limited-income families.\u00a0\n\u201cThat diversity benefits families as they\u2019re able to choose from all different settings that maybe look a little bit different, might be closer to home, might be able to meet their needs better,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe system\u2019s struggles\nSo far, though, the mixed delivery plan is not meeting expectations.\u00a0\nSchool districts were expected to have 30% of their pre-K slots filled by private providers in the 2022-23 school year, but most school systems did not meet that requirement, according to Brianna January, an associate policy director for the Maryland Association of Counties.\u00a0\nAnd all but one local school district \u2014 Montgomery County Public Schools \u2014 requested a waiver after being unable to meet the requirement of having 35% of pre-K seats in the private sector for the 2023-24 school year, said Hise, of the Accountability and Implementation Board.\nWith districts expected to fill half their pre-K slots through private providers by the 2026-27 school year, districts find themselves under increasing pressure to strike deals with companies that provide that service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s proving to be a bit more challenging than I think a lot of folks really expected,\u201d January said.\u00a0\nThe creators of the Blueprint expected private child care providers would be interested in joining the pre-K industry, January explained, but providers are not as eager as had been anticipated.\u00a0\nFor one thing, there\u2019s a money issue.\u00a0\n\u201cWe recognize that the reimbursement rate for [private] providers is not high enough to incentivize them to provide slots for these 3-year-olds,\u201d said Del. Courtney Watson, D-Howard. \u201cThat is a major problem across the state.\u201d\u00a0\nIn addition, child care providers must overcome a number of barriers before they can actually qualify to offer pre-K.\nFor example, starting in the 2025-26 school year, pre-K teaching assistants will be required to obtain either an associate\u2019s degree or a Child Development Associate certificate. Pre-K teachers will be required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree and hold teaching certification in early childhood education or be enrolled in a certification program.\u00a0\nThe trouble is some child care providers will not be able to go to school and keep their businesses running at the same time, said Christina Peusch, executive director of the Maryland State Childcare Association.\n\u201cThat is set up to fail,\u201d Peusch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not equitable.\u201d\nAnother potential barrier is private providers must adhere to Maryland EXCELS \u2014 the state\u2019s quality rating and improvement system for child care facilities. Bonuses ranging from $150 to $13,500 will be awarded to participating child care programs on a rating scale of 1 to 5 based on program type, quality rating and capacity.\u00a0\nSt. Mary\u2019s County has no private providers that are rated \u201cEXCELS 5,\u201d the highest possible ranking, said Kristen Paul, director of early childhood programs at The Parents\u2019 Place of Maryland, which connects parents of children with disabilities and health care needs to resources.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough pre-K slots right now,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a gap.\u201d\nA space shortage?\nOn top of the struggles in finding private providers, some education experts are concerned there is not enough physical space in some school buildings to accommodate pre-K classrooms.\n\u201cI would love to have pre-K in our school,\u201d said Jamie Miller, principal of Broadneck Elementary School in Anne Arundel County. \u201cBut our school building is very, very old and there\u2019s not a place for them. \u2026 Every single classroom is full and at max capacity, so I don\u2019t have a space right now.\u201d\nShamoyia Gardiner, executive director of Strong Schools Maryland, an organization created to advocate for the passage of the Blueprint, said she\u2019s worried about such space shortages.\nFor Maryland public schools to offer pre-K, the physical space in buildings must meet standards set by the state\u2019s Interagency Commission on School Construction. But Gardiner noted the commission\u2019s requirements were not aligned with the Blueprint during its creation.\nThat commission \u2014 which decides exactly which school construction projects the state will fund \u2014 uses a \u201cblunt tool\u201d of measuring the amount of square feet per student, said Lynne Harris, a member of the Montgomery County Board of Education. But that blunt instrument doesn\u2019t take into account that pre-K classrooms have different requirements, such as a bathroom, Harris said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAre they going to finally acknowledge that to build facilities to house the pre-K programming that is mandated by the Blueprint, it\u2019s going to require the [school construction commission] to relax?\u201d she said.\u00a0\nSome private providers need more space, too, and the state has a grant program that aims to allow them to expand.\u00a0\n\u201cThe grant is highly competitive,\u201d said Ruby Daniels, president of the Maryland State Family Child Care Association. \u201cWhen you apply, you\u2019re actually competing with the [local education agencies], which is the public school. You\u2019re completely competing with Head Start, you\u2019re completely competing with child care centers.\u201d\nIn a letter sent to state leaders in November, the Maryland Association of Counties urged lawmakers to increase state aid to construct pre-K facilities and ease requirements to encourage more private providers to take part in the program.\nThis legislative session, the General Assembly is hoping to iron out some of the Blueprint\u2019s wrinkles to ensure Maryland is living up to its promises of expanding and improving early childhood education, said Watson, the Democratic state delegate from Howard County.\nJanuary emphasized the county leaders she works with are dedicated to implementing the Blueprint and collaborating with state leaders to help expand pre-K successfully.\n\u201cWe have to work together. We have to get it right,\u201d January said. \u201cCounty governments are really trying to be good partners and they want to make the Blueprint work. They want to see it successful.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's ambitious education reform, the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, aims to significantly enhance public schooling but lacks a clear long-term funding strategy, potentially leading to substantial financial deficits by 2029. While Democrats remain committed to the plan without proposing solutions, Republicans warn of unsustainable costs and potential need for significant new taxes.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Maryland\u2019s Democratic-led legislature passed the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future in 2021, vowing to pour billions of dollars into the state\u2019s public schools to offer universal pre-K, improve teaching and make sure students are ready for college or careers.\nBut the General Assembly didn\u2019t outline a long-term plan to fund the ambitious 10-year education reform effort\u00a0 \u2014 which increasingly looks like a blueprint for red ink.\nDiving deep into the reform plan in reporting \u201cBehind the Blueprint\u201d \u2014 a multi-part look at the state effort \u2014 the Local News Network at the University of Maryland found that the Blueprint is already devouring hundreds of millions annually from the state\u2019s fund balance, which is on target to be fully drained in 2027.\nAnd according to a state Department of Legislative Services fiscal briefing released in January, the state will start running a structural deficit in fiscal year 2025 that will multiply nearly sixfold by fiscal year 2029, when it will hit $2.93 billion. Not coincidentally, that fiscal briefing estimates implementing the Blueprint will cost more than $4 billion in 2029.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s plan for dealing with the cost crunch? There isn\u2019t one \u2014 at least not yet. Neither Gov. Wes Moore in his State of the State address nor any of the Democratic state legislators interviewed for this story have offered any potential solutions for the coming Blueprint cash crunch.\n\u201cSeveral years from now we\u2019re going to have to have a much more direct conversation about the long-term costs,\u201d said state Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat from Baltimore City. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\nRepublicans, meanwhile, see the Blueprint as a budget-breaker.\n\u201cWe cannot pay these billions and billions of dollars in extra monies \u2014 not just state but local as well,\u201d said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany. \u201cWe can\u2019t pay for them unless you\u2019re going to talk about new taxes \u2014 and significant taxes.\u201d\nThe Blueprint\u2019s background\nIronically, the Blueprint was born out of a commission supported by a Republican governor \u2014 who later backed away from the plan because of cost concerns.\u00a0\nIn 2016, then-Gov. Larry Hogan and the General Assembly created the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education to assess the public education system in Maryland and determine whether current funding schemes were conducive to student success.\u00a0\nHeaded by William Kirwan, the former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, the commission came to the conclusion that an overhaul was needed.\n\u201cOne of the \u2018aha\u2019 moments of the commission was really to face the fact that in Maryland, on what we call the Nation\u2019s Report Card, Maryland\u2019s score was about in the middle \u2026 and moving in the wrong direction,\u201d said Rachel Hise, executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board, a state entity that\u2019s making sure school districts adhere to the plan.\nBut Hogan had an \u201caha\u201d moment of his own after Democrats crafted the Kirwan Commission\u2019s report into comprehensive legislation. In 2019, Hogan criticized the pending reform proposal, telling a group of county officials it would mean \u201cbillions and billions more in mandated spending increases for county and state taxpayers,\u201d according to The Frederick News-Post.\nHogan vetoed the bill creating the Blueprint in May 2020, saying he did not want to raise taxes amid the COVID-19 pandemic to fund the education plan. The General Assembly overrode his veto in 2021.\nAnd the following year, voters elected a strong backer of the Blueprint \u2014 Democrat Wes Moore \u2014 to succeed Hogan, who is now running for a U.S. Senate seat.\nOn the first day of the current legislative session that began in January, Moore said he believes in the reform plan and he will work with the General Assembly to ensure the Blueprint is implemented properly and sustainably.\u00a0\n\u201cI believe in the premise and the promise of the Blueprint. I think we need a world-class education system in the state of Maryland,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be a prerequisite for us to be able to accomplish the economic goal that we\u2019re hoping for.\u201d\nLofty goals\nIn the state\u2019s 24 public school districts, the Blueprint and its lofty goals are already beginning to take shape.\nEach school district has already drawn up a preliminary plan for how it will meet targets for offering pre-K, increasing teacher salaries and improving student performance. The Accountability and Implementation Board has approved all those plans after first asking for revisions.\nThe Blueprint is meant to revamp the state\u2019s education system by presenting the same opportunities for all students. With a law like the Blueprint, one size has to fit all to achieve its goals of maximizing reading and math skills, as well as increasing pathways into college, said Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel.\u00a0\n\u201cSo we want that for every kid across the state. We don\u2019t want variation of those goals,\u201d Rosapepe said. \u201cNow, the details of how stuff is paid for \u2014 I mean, I think that\u2019s a conversation that will be ongoing.\u201d\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said the teachers union is fully behind the Blueprint.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a shared understanding that our goal is for students to succeed academically and become valuable citizens in our state and in our country,\u201d Bost said. \u201cIn order to do that, we have to make an investment in public education. I think for the most part, the Blueprint identifies where that money has to go.\u201d\nWhat it doesn\u2019t do, however, is identify where the money will come from. Bost, whose union represents 74,000 educators in the state, acknowledged the concerns about the Blueprint\u2019s cost. But she indicated the increased spending on education is both needed and long overdue.\n\u201cWe constitutionally have to provide a public education for all students, so the investment is needed,\u201d Bost said.\u00a0\u201cAnd when some people balk at, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s all this money\u2019 \u2014 well, we\u2019ve been starving public education for many years.\u201d\nThe budget dilemma\nThe Blueprint remains fully funded in Moore\u2019s latest fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, leaving many lawmakers to turn their attention to other legislative issues this year. Ferguson, the Senate president, said in terms of current Blueprint funding, \u201cwe\u2019re more than fine.\u201d\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s not so in the long term. The cost of implementing the Blueprint is projected to grow from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $4.1 billion five years later, according to the Department of Legislative Services. Meantime, the state\u2019s structural budget gap is set to balloon every year through 2029 \u2014 when Legislative Services expects it to be $2.9 billion and the Moore administration says it will be about $3.5 billion.\nClosing that budget gap will be immensely difficult, said Christopher Summers, president and CEO of the conservative Maryland Policy Institute, who also said the Blueprint should be paused.\n\u201cRaising taxes (is) not going to solve this problem, and I think the governor knows that,\u201d said Summers, who has been critical of the Blueprint for years.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint calls on school districts to increase education funding too, thereby prompting Summers to say that county budgets face the biggest fiscal threat.\nBut in Annapolis, lawmakers from both parties acknowledged that the General Assembly will have to make some tough decisions in the years to come as the Blueprint\u2019s bills come due.\n\u201cI think we know the reality that we\u2019re facing. And I think there\u2019s gonna be a lot of discussion about that,\u201d said State Sen. Guy J. Guzzone, a Democrat from Howard County. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that there\u2019s an immediate answer.\u201d\nOne obvious solution would be raising taxes to cover the state\u2019s coming shortfalls. But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey, a Republican from the Eastern Shore, said a solution lies in cutting back the demands of the Blueprint rather than paying for the sweeping overhaul as it stands.\n\u201cRepublicans have stated very often that we need to move to a \u2018Blueprint lite\u2019 or you know, some type of education reform that takes some of the important components of the Blueprint, but at the same time is affordable and allows counties to make decisions on which parts of the Blueprint are more meaningful in each of their public school systems,\u201d Hershey said.\nDemocrats, however, back the current Blueprint, despite its cost. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said legislators should start talking about a long-term payment plan for the Blueprint now. The shared values between the legislature and the governor will bring them together, Barnes said, to solve the Blueprint budget dilemma.\n\u201cThis legislature, the governor, we share values, and those shared values include all the priorities of the Blueprint,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cGetting to children who live in communities of poverty, taking care of special needs students, I mean, these are what we all ran on. And so I feel confident we\u2019ll find the revenue we need to support that program.\u201d\nSeveral state officials have said they are looking to the Accountability and Implementation Board to issue recommendations regarding the Blueprint\u2019s budget challenges. The board has made policy proposals included in bills that, if passed this legislative session, would make adjustments to the law without changing the finances.\u00a0\nIn addition, the board is set to release additional recommendations this legislative session.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the AIB has tried to sort of suggest is like, let\u2019s try to implement it the way it\u2019s intended. And if it doesn\u2019t work, if it\u2019s just no longer the right thing to do, then we need to change it,\u201d said Hise, the board\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut for many things, we haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet.\u201d",

The goal is to make pre-K available to all 4-year-olds by the 2025-26 school year.\nHigh Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders: With Maryland \u2014 like the nation \u2014 confronting a teacher shortage, this pillar seeks to attract and retain teachers by raising pay, increasing training and building a new career ladder.\nCollege and Career Readiness: This pillar aims to make all of the state\u2019s students ready for college and careers by the end of 10th grade. The state plans a redrawing of its public school curriculum and a stronger emphasis on early college and vocational training.\u00a0 \nIncreased Resources: This pillar will increase the state\u2019s per-pupil funding amount annually until the 2032-33 school year. Currently at $8,642, the funding will eventually reach $12,365. But the Blueprint also places additional funding burdens on the state\u2019s school districts.\nGovernance and Accountability: The state created a new agency, the Accountability and Implementation Board, to develop the state\u2019s 10-year Blueprint plan and ensure all districts and schools are following it. \u00a0\n\nLater Local News Network stories will detail how the plan will affect other facets of public education in the state.\nRead the full series here.",

If this is successful, the model might be used for other schools across the state.\nHarford has done well in recruiting and retaining teachers. District officials have created a new job, \u201cdiversity retention and recruitment specialist,\u201d to focus on getting more young people to become educators, helping educators move up in their careers, and welcoming people looking to change careers into education.\nHarford has strong partnerships with universities (Towson and Notre Dame of Maryland) for\u00a0 preparing teachers, professional development, and a new Bachelor of Arts program for child development associate certification holders.\nHarford has an updated literacy plan that uses the same tools and materials in all schools within the district, and those reading strategies are also used in other subjects.\nHarford is examining all instructional materials to make sure they are fair for everyone.\nHarford currently has a substantial program for high school students to take college classes, which includes earning college credits in career and technical education subjects.\n\nNeeds improvement:\n\nHarford has done well in creating more room for pre-K programs in schools, but does not have a clear strategy for growing its connection with private preschools.\nHarford\u2019s career ladder plan focuses on National Board Certification and union negotiations, but lacks a strategy for reorganizing schools to enhance teaching roles and improve student learning. The district could benefit from guidance to develop a more comprehensive career ladder that emphasizes teacher leadership and goes beyond National Board Certification and salary incentives.\nAlthough Harford has a math plan, it needs to be updated to fit the Blueprint\u2019s goals and the district\u2019s literacy program.\nIt\u2019s unclear how Harford\u2019s plan to support students not on track to graduate is connected with its college and career-readiness efforts. The main priority should be making sure that students have the English and math skills to move on to college or careers.\n\n\u2013 Matthew Watson",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0 The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration\u2019s plans to make college more affordable.\nThe College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel\u2019s chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\u201cUnfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\u201d said Foxx, \u201cCongress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\u201d\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden\u2019s original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration\u2019s plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx\u2019s College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\u00a0\nRep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, praised parts of Foxx\u2019s bill, \u201csuch as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\u201d but the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning, D-Michigan, offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\u00a0\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano, D-California, introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Michigan, offered a motion to remove the bill\u2019s rescission of Biden\u2019s SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\u201cThe new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration\u2026 creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\u201d Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Michigan, unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici\u2019s proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 After the back-to-back shootings\u00a0in October\u00a0at Morgan State University and Bowie State University, advocates for\u00a0Historically Black Colleges and Universities\u00a0(HBCUs)\u00a0say that underfunding is leading to lack of proper safety and security resources on\u00a0their campuses.\nTheir concerns have drawn support from Capitol Hill.\nRep. Alma Adams, D-North Carolina, and the founder of the Congressional HBCU Caucus,\u00a0sent letters\u00a0to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Dr. Miguel Cardona and\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,\u00a0saying there needs to be a \u201cconcerted effort to provide funding to HBCUs for them to protect their student body and faculty\u00a0from violence.\u201d\nShe added that safety and security on HBCU campuses must be a \u201ctop priority\u201d and requested that her office meet regularly with the Biden administration to discuss funding\u00a0and safety concerns.\nOn Oct. 3, five people were injured after a shooting on Morgan State\u2019s campus during homecoming festivities. Just four days later, two people were injured after a shooting on Bowie State\u2019s\u00a0campus, also during homecoming.\nRyan Coleman, president of the Randallstown NAACP, was on Bowie State\u2019s campus visiting family when the shooting happened. The police presence on campus that night was not\u00a0sufficient, he said.\n\u201cYou saw some police\u2026but it became really obvious that they weren\u2019t walking around the campus\u2026they weren\u2019t patrolling like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were multiple events on the campus\u00a0with multiple people. And there just wasn\u2019t any police presence at those individual events.\u201d\nColeman described the scene during the shooting as \u201cchaos.\u201d While\u00a0sheltering\u00a0in a dorm with his family, he said he saw people running and trying to get off campus, and that the police\u00a0didn\u2019t start evacuating campus until about an hour later.\n\u201cThe Bowie State University Police were over their heads, it was obvious they did not have the police resources to handle this,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIf there was an active shooter who actually\u00a0wanted to do harm to students, I have no faith that that person would\u2019ve been stopped at all.\u201d\nAfter the shooting, Bowie State President Aminta Breaux said the school\u00a0would\u00a0revisit the idea of adding metal detectors to campus, but emphasized that \u201cno one person has the solution to\u00a0all the challenges the university faces.\u201d\nBowie State University did not respond to a request for comment about the police presence during the shooting there.\nAt Morgan State, President David K. Wilson announced his plan to extend a fence barrier around campus, saying it will help limit \u201cunfettered pedestrian access.\u201d\nThe school also said it plans to hire more police officers, implement more security cameras around campus and add metal detectors at entrances. The measures will cost millions of dollars\u00a0and the school said it hopes to receive additional state and federal funding.\nAfter watching the shooting unfold at Morgan State, Coleman wrote a letter to the president of Howard University, where his daughter is enrolled, urging the school to take action during its\u00a0homecoming celebration in October, including increasing police presence and adding metal detectors at entrances to events, among other precautions.\nAt\u00a0its\u00a0homecoming celebration, Howard\u00a0officials\u00a0said that safety was their \u201cmain priority\u201d ahead of the events, and the school had its campus police and Metro police patrolling campus.\nOn Monday, college officials across Maryland gathered behind closed doors to discuss campus safety in the wake of the Morgan State shooting. They discussed prevention\u00a0technology on campus, and the importance of doing checks on existing security measures, like security cameras, according to WBAL in Baltimore.\nCampus officials also emphasized the importance of community policing, and that schools should partner with surrounding police departments.\nColeman said that when he has\u00a0visited the University of Maryland or other non-HBCUs in Maryland, those institutions seem to have the resources they need, whether it\u2019s funding,\u00a0programming or security on campus.\nMaryland\u00a0HBCU Advocates spokeswoman Sharon Blake echoed Coleman, saying that underfunding at the institutions is widespread, whether it is in programming, scholarships or security.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have enough money, you cut corners wherever you can. And that, of course, does include public safety, and that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Blake said.\nIn Congress, Adams has passed many bills\u00a0that\u00a0supporting HBCUs. Last year, in the wake of bomb threats against HBCU campuses across the country, Adams passed a\u00a0resolution that condemned violence at HBCUs and reaffirmed Congress\u2019s support for these schools.\nIn 2019, Adams also passed legislation that established two fiscal years\u2019 worth of mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions.\nEarlier this year, the\u00a0United Negro College Fund (UNCF) proposed legislation that would direct $100 million each year from FEMA\u2019s non-profit grants security program to go\u00a0towards safety initiatives on HBCU campuses. Adams\u2019 office said she is \u201cstrongly in favor\u201d of this proposal.\nIn terms of federal funding, the Biden-Harris administration has invested over $7 million in the nation\u2019s HBCUs, and has directed money in the 2022 and 2023 spending\u00a0packages, specifically supporting scholarships and grants, as well as institutional development.\nWhile the administration has not specifically increased funding for campus safety in reference to shootings, the Department of Education did secure over $2 million in grants\u00a0to help schools recover after violent events, such as bomb threats.\nAdditionally,\u00a0in September, the Biden administration sent letters to the governors of 16 states, including Maryland, asking them to\u00a0direct\u00a0more money for their land-grant HBCUs.\nIn the letters, Cardona and Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack\u00a0said they\u00a0found that the states\u2019 land-grant HBCUs received a collective $13 billion less than they should have in the last\u00a0few decades, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nMaryland\u2019s land-grant HBCU is the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which the analysis found to have a $321 million funding gap in state appropriations in the last 30 years, compared\u00a0to the predominantly white land-grant universities in the state, including the University of Maryland College Park.\n\u201cThe longstanding and ongoing underinvestment in University of Maryland Eastern Shore disadvantages the students, faculty, and community that the institution serves,\u201d the two secretaries\u00a0wrote. \u201cIt is our hope that we can work together to make this institution whole after decades of being underfunded.\u201d\nThe letter also acknowledges that the state government has been making steps toward addressing the funding gap in recent years.\nIn 2021, then-Gov. Larry Hogan approved legislation giving $577 million to Maryland HBCUs over a decade,\u00a0which Moore has said he will uphold, according to his office.\nMoore allocated $422 million for all four schools in his first budget, and in February approved $3 million in grants to three schools, including Morgan State and Bowie State.\u00a0Since Moore\u00a0took office, funding for Maryland HBCUs has increased over 20%, according to his office.\nMoore\u2019s office said that he \u201cfirmly believes that every student deserves to feel safe on campus and that everyone involved needs to work hard to ensure that these tragedies\u00a0no longer take place in Maryland.\u201d\nBut even the increased funding and support still does not rectify decades of underfunding, Coleman\u00a0said.\n\u201cEven if (HBCUs) are given some money\u2026they\u2019ve been underfunded for 30 or 40 years, and they\u2019re not really being brought to a whole,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Despite challenges like teacher vacancies and late arrivals due to security protocols, some incarcerated youth in Maryland's juvenile facilities are achieving educational milestones, such as earning GEDs. However, two years after the transfer of educational responsibilities to a new school board within the Juvenile Services Department, many students still face significant barriers to consistent education.",
    "content": "SABILLASVILLE, Md. \u2014 The graduate\u2019s mom, peers and teachers knew he was going to reach his goal, though his principal, Todd Rasher, said the other students incarcerated at the Victor Cullen Center in rural northern Frederick County didn\u2019t see \u201call the footwork\u201d it took to earn his GED.\n\u201cThis diploma ain\u2019t really too much because I knew that I was going to get it,\u201d the 17-year-old said to his graduation audience on Oct. 18, wearing a cap and gown, kente stole and black wristband adorned with, \u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d\u00a0\nThe graduate, whose identity CNS is shielding because he is a minor, was charged as an adult before his case was transferred to juvenile court. Rasher said he passed the tests necessary to earn his GED on the first try, inspiring his fellow students to take the tests themselves.\u00a0\nThe graduate\u2019s mom, TaNeya Anderson, said that services she and her son received since her son was locked up, including family therapy and regular updates from Cullen staff, have helped her family.\u00a0\n\u201cIt might seem like it was a bad thing that he ended up having to get incarcerated, but I\u2019m always trying to get the good out of it, and I believe it was meant for this to happen this way,\u201d Anderson said.\nNot all incarcerated young people are able to continue their education, much less attain a degree. Two years after the Maryland General Assembly transferred responsibility for incarcerated students\u2019 education from the state Education Department to an independent school board within the Juvenile Services Department, students confined in Maryland\u2019s secure youth facilities continue to face multiple long-standing challenges, according to experts and state audit reports.\n\nTeacher vacancy rates of 30% in the most populous Juvenile Services schools have led to reliance on streaming instruction in subjects such as math and science.\nIncarcerated students were late to class hundreds of times in 2023 due to the security requirements \u2014 especially a state Juvenile Services policy mandating that staff supervise and escort youth while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio.\u00a0\nA lack of guidance from the State Board of Education has allowed local school boards broad scope to reject students charged with various offenses, including those who have been in detention, arguing they are a threat \u2013 even when Juvenile Services and the courts have decided it\u2019s safe to release them.\n\nTwo of the state\u2019s three most populous youth detention centers and its only long-term placement facility, Cullen, operated with teacher vacancy rates around 30% as of early October, according to documents discussed in public meetings of the Juvenile Services Education Program Board. The Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, which served 301 students that year, had eight vacancies. The Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, which served 245 students, had seven. Cullen, which served 76 students, had four.\nWhen facilities lack subject experts to teach in person, students take classes livestreamed by juvenile services teachers from the Garrett Children\u2019s Center, a former youth committed placement center in Garrett County.\u00a0\nThree of the nine Juvenile Services schools, including Hickey and Cullen, had no math teacher as of October, while four, including Hickey and the Baltimore center, lacked a science teacher. Baltimore\u2019s Juvenile Justice Center was looking for a second math teacher to serve its large population.\u00a0\nDavid Domenici, director of education and senior adviser to the Juvenile Services secretary, said streaming instruction is \u201cnot ideal\u201d for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of students but better than packets of photocopied activities.\nJuvenile Services teacher vacancies have persisted through tensions between Maryland\u2019s education and Juvenile Services agencies over the past decade about who bears responsibility for educating incarcerated young people and how best to do so. Those vacancies continue through teachers\u2019\u00a0 lack of summer and winter breaks and low pay relative to teachers employed by local school districts.\nLawmakers voted in 2004 to stage the Education Department\u2019s takeover of Juvenile Services schools over eight years but repeatedly extended the timeline as Education protested inadequate funding. Bills seeking pay parity and summer breaks for juvenile services teachers failed in 2016, 2019 and 2020, often pitting experts from Education and Juvenile Services against each other. The General Assembly established a statewide education board within Juvenile Services in 2021 in response to monitors\u2019 and advocacy groups\u2019 repeated findings of high staff turnover and vacancies, inadequate services for learning disabled students and a lack of support for students returning to community schools. But the law did not require pay parity or align facilities\u2019 teaching calendar more closely with local schools.\nPeter Leone, an emeritus University of Maryland education professor contracted by the Education Department to assess its work in Juvenile Services facilities between 2016 and 2018, said that educating incarcerated students was \u201ca very low priority\u201d for the Education department.\nThe Education Department declined to comment on its management of Juvenile Services education or on the current board.\nWhile public school teachers earn salaries set by local school boards, Juvenile Services teachers are paid on a single, statewide pay scale. Juvenile services teachers experience the greatest pay disparities in jurisdictions where local school boards pay the most.\u00a0\nThe Juvenile Services board has implemented hiring and retention bonuses that board superintendent Kim Pogue said she hopes will improve recruitment.\nEven with these bonuses, teachers in the state\u2019s largest youth detention centers, in Baltimore and Prince George\u2019s County, earn less per day than teachers working in local schools. A teacher at Hickey or Baltimore\u2019s Juvenile Justice Center makes 9.5% less daily than a teacher in neighboring Baltimore County. A teacher at Cheltenham makes 3.9% less than a Prince George\u2019s County teacher. In Washington County, teachers at the Western Maryland Children\u2019s Center make 10.2% less than county teachers.\nDomenici said the board would have to decide whether to seek legislative or other changes to teacher pay and work schedules. Domenici, who is not a board member, said the legislature should have set 10- and 12-month employee categories, established a school calendar limiting when Juvenile Services teachers can take leave and creating a regional pay scale aligned with local districts.\nBut lost instructional time is greatest due to a lack of residential advisers, according to audits of Juvenile Services schools by the state Office of the Inspector General. Departmental policy requires that residential staff escort students from their living units to classrooms while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. When there aren\u2019t enough residential staff, students don\u2019t move.\u00a0\nStudents were late to class 203 times across Juvenile Services facilities due to residential staff shortages between April and June alone, according to the audits. Teachers had to teach class inside the living units 43 times in the 90-day inspection period.\nGetting students in the classroom, even if they are late, Domenici said, is better than class on the living units. The department is working toward a goal of 90% on-time attendance in school by shifting all onsite adults to escort students to school, he said.\nSpending time in detention or committed placement hurts students\u2019 education in the longer term.\nLegal experts and youth advocates say students who have been detained face obstacles returning to school due to overly broad state laws and an absence of guidance to local school systems from the Department of Education.\nLaw enforcement is required to report to superintendents and principals when students are charged with certain \u201creportable offenses\u201d outside of school, including rape, first degree assault and carjacking.\nExperts say a 2022 state law limiting when local school systems can exclude students based on charges does not lay out a statewide standard to assess whether students present a threat nor outline procedures to protect students\u2019 and parents\u2019 rights.\u00a0\nRegulations that the State Board of Education has proposed to flesh out the law provide insufficient protections, according to comments submitted by the Public Defender\u2019s Office, Disability Rights Maryland and the Public Justice Center.\nAlyssa Fieo, assistant public defender for education in the Juvenile Protection Division of the Maryland Public Defender\u2019s Office, said she has worked on a handful of cases involving reportable offenses in at least five counties since the passage of the 2022 law.\nSchools failed to hold required meetings between parents and school officials before students\u2019 removal to establish whether students presented a threat, and schools don\u2019t invite students\u2019 attorneys when they do. In one case, the school system did not hold a required meeting to determine whether the alleged offense was a manifestation of a student\u2019s disability before removing the student. In most of the cases, students were recently released from detention.\n\u201cA handful of the cases I\u2019ve represented, the family got a phone call saying, \u2018We understand your child has a charge. They\u2019re going to be put on virtual school. We\u2019re going to drop off the computer,\u2019\u201d Fieo said.\nState law requires the state\u2019s attorney to promptly notify school officials of the ruling on a student\u2019s case, and the proposed regulations would require schools to then review the student\u2019s school assignment. The three organizations are asking the Education Department to clarify that students should be allowed to return to school once the state\u2019s attorney, Juvenile Services and the courts have approved the student\u2019s return to the community. There is currently no limit on how long a \u201creportable offense\u201d charge can be used as a reason to exclude a student from regular instruction.\nAt Cullen, Rasher said, he has access to any student\u2019s record, but he chooses not to look.\n\u201cI know everybody has a story,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are pretty awful. But to me, that\u2019s not a thing.\u201d\nThe day the graduate walked up to the podium and moved his tassel from one side of his cap to the other, he focused on his future: He was set to start work on an occupational safety certification the next day.\nThe graduate said Cullen\u2019s walls enclose a complex reality that outsiders can\u2019t see, and that the youth of Cullen are just as complex.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just judge a book by its cover like they say, for real,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of us in here, our cover is just what they show on the media or the news, you feel me, but they don\u2019t know what actually goes on inside of here. \u2026If you\u2019re on the outside looking in, you\u2019re not going to see what we see. Because we here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely proud about it, but it\u2019s more to come, so.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's 2023 MCAP results show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, while math scores have improved but remain below 2019 levels, and science scores have declined. Baltimore City saw the most significant improvement in English proficiency, while four counties experienced a decline in math proficiency.",
    "content": "College Park, Md. \u2014 The results for the 2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) tests for grades 3 to 8 show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed the level it was at before the pandemic. Math scores have improved, but have yet to fully rebound from the pandemic, while science scores have declined, according to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE).\nMCAP tests are administered annually in public schools to assist educators in understanding student progression so that they can better tailor their methods of instruction, according to MSDE.\nStudents in grades three to eight take tests in English and math, while students in grades five and eight are given an additional science test.\nEnglish proficiency surpasses 2019\nAccording to data from MSDE, average English proficiency dropped from 44% in 2019 to 31% in 2021.\nProficiency increased significantly in 2022 and by a smaller degree in 2023, with results showing an average passing rate of 47%, according to MSDE.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\n\nImprovements can be seen across Maryland, as every county except Somerset had an increase in English proficiency between 2022 and 2023. Somerset County had a slight 0.3 % decrease in scores. Baltimore City had the most improvement with 22%.\n\nMath proficiency still below pre-pandemic levels\nThe 24% average passing rate for math in 2023 is still lower than the 31% in 2019, indicating that math scores have still not fully recovered from pandemic learning loss.\nDespite average passing rates in math still not being as high as in 2019, they have gone up since dropping to 15% in 2021. Proficiency increased by 6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and 3 percentage points from 2022 to 2023.\n\nNot every county had an improvement, as there are four counties that saw a decline in average math proficiency from 2022 to 2023: Baltimore, Kent, Somerset and Talbot. Baltimore County had a significant 15% drop in math proficiency from 2022.\n\nBaltimore County Public Schools Board of Education Member at Large Tiara Booker-Dwyer said that an explanation for the slower improvement in math scores is that the format of math questions in these tests have become more layered, which makes it difficult for parents, teachers and administrators trained in the traditional format to help students get accustomed.\n\u201cNot only do you have to have that English language proficiency to understand \u2018what is this question asking,\u2019 then you also have to have that mathematic skill set to do the problem,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a little bit longer for students to truly master, it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer for teachers to truly master how to facilitate instruction on it.\u201d\nHistorically underserved students lag behind\nDespite making improvements over the last two years, average scores for historically underserved students in English and math still lag behind. The most recent scores of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaska Native students are still below those of white and Asian students.\n\nBooker-Dwyer said that it is important to build the cultural competency of educators so that they can connect better with students.\n\u201cWhen you look at the curriculum that was developed, it speaks to a certain demographic. There are certain people who just \u2018I\u2019m not going to connect with this,\u2019 so it\u2019s going to go in one ear and out the other. Or when they try to connect to it, people recognize that it\u2019s inauthentic,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said.\nBooker-Dwyer states that another solution is encouraging more historically underserved students to take honors and AP classes, as well as providing resources to schools to give them these opportunities.\n\u201cWhat the research shows is that if you\u2019re placed in an advanced academic class or gifted class, even if you\u2019re earning C\u2019s in there, you\u2019re better off long term than if you\u2019re just in the standard class,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just exposure to certain things, just being in a classroom, around students who are performing at a certain level will kind of unintentionally make you perform at a higher level,\u201d she said.\nGrade 8 science proficiency hits five-year low\nScience scores continue to lag, especially for grade 8.\nIn grade 5, science proficiency in the last five years peaked in 2021 at 41%, a 12-percentage point increase from 2019. In 2022, the passing rate dropped to 31% before rising again to 35% in 2023, according to MSDE.\nGrade 8 scores have been on a steady decline since 2021, with the passing rate dropping from 35% in 2022 to 26% in 2023, the lowest it\u2019s been in the last five years.\n\nWith the exception of Dorchester, every county had at least a 10% decline in grade 8 science proficiency from 2022 to 2023. Six counties had over a 30% decrease from 2022: Kent, Charles, Prince George\u2019s, Washington, Allegany and Queen Anne\u2019s.\n\nMSDE states that this decline is likely due to the grade 8 students being in grade 6 during the 2020-2021 school year, which was predominantly online. As a result, students missed key science instruction during their first year of middle school.\n\u201cThe results on the grade 8 assessment make clear the impact of grade 6 and 7 disruptions on a cumulative grade 8 assessment,\u201d MSDE said in the press release.\nBooker-Dwyer stated that rollout for the new Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 education, which has lessons in engineering, technology, earth and space sciences in addition to traditional sciences, was delayed by the pandemic. She remains optimistic that scores will improve as curriculum continues to change.\n\u201cI do believe it will get better as people are getting more and more comfortable with the science standards and more teachers are getting trained and the resources are getting better, as far as the instructional material,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said. \u201cBut initially it was tough.\u201d\nBooker-Dwyer discusses the need for a \u201csystems approach\u201d to address learning-loss in the school system, as learning is sequential. Students who aren\u2019t prepared with the foundations necessary for the new grade-level won\u2019t be able to pick up the curriculum as easily.\n\u201cWe have to look at this holistically. It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing this issue with our school systems,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said. \u201cThis is where I think the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future has some potential because it can give school systems some flexibility to get a little bit more innovative in how they\u2019re approaching the learning.\u201d\n\u201cBut the thing about it is you can only be as innovative as the state allows. And so until there\u2019s some major changes at the state level, we won\u2019t see those innovative schooling approaches happen at the school level,\u201d she said.\nThe 2024 MCAP tests are set to begin in the spring.",

    "content": "OCEAN CITY, Md. \u2013 As Maryland rolls out the 2021 landmark education reform law called the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, many school administrators are unsure what the plan means for their schools.\u00a0\nAt the annual School Leaders Conference held Nov. 2-4 in Ocean City, state officials and school principals reviewed the details of the Blueprint and discussed how it will be implemented in each school district.\nThe wave of impending policy changes are meant to address the challenges facing educators and students across the state. For example, Emily Abell, principal of Monarch Global Academy in Anne Arundel County, said her school is experiencing the effects of the nationwide teacher shortage.\u00a0\nAsked about the Blueprint, she said: \u201cIs it gonna help? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to see what it looks like on paper and when we start to implement.\u201d\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nThe Blueprint is grounded in the analysis of a group of independent policy experts formed by the state in 2016 to establish a baseline for education reform. Though formally named the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, the group was commonly referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William E. Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland.\u00a0\nBy 2019, the Kirwan Commission had come to some sobering conclusions about Maryland\u2019s education system. Half of all teachers leave the profession within the first five years. Only two out of every five kindergarteners arrive in the classroom ready to learn. And just a third of students leave high school being \u201ccollege and career ready\u201d in English and math.\n\u201cThat was pre-pandemic. So generally speaking, it\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d said Rachel Hise, a policy specialist who worked for the state in tandem with the Kirwan Commission. Explaining the commission\u2019s findings to school leaders in Ocean City, she said the independent body concluded that \u201cultimately, the status quo is unsustainable.\u201d\nBecause of the work of the Kirwan Commission, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future in February 2021, overriding a veto by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who had cost concerns about the plan.\nThe Blueprint allocates $3.8 billion to schools over the next 10 years and is based on five \u201cpillars.\u201d\n\nPillar 1: Early Childhood Education, which includes the expansion of pre-K to three and four-year-olds through both public schools and private providers.\nPillar 2: High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders, which mandates raises in teacher salaries and incentivizes them to attain National Board Certification.\nPillar 3: College and Career Readiness, which establishes changes to high school curriculum, technical training programs and opportunities for apprenticeships.\nPillar 4: More Resources to Ensure that All Students are Successful, which provides more money to schools in need.\nPillar 5: Governance and Accountability, which creates a framework of oversight led by the Accountability and Implementation Board, the state agency created to administer the plan.\n\nHise is now executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board. She said the policy changes will make sure students are ready to learn in kindergarten and ready to succeed when they graduate high school.\n\u201cThe Blueprint is aiming to have all 4-year-olds in public full-day pre-K,\u201d said Hise.\u00a0\nBecause public schools lack the capacity to fulfill this mandate alone, the state will fund programming via private pre-K providers as well.\u00a0\n\u201cThe goal is a socioeconomically integrated pre-K system that is publicly funded, but that is provided by both public schools and private providers,\u201d Hise told administrators in Ocean City.\nThe Blueprint will also mean big changes in high schools.\n\u201cWhat the Blueprint really envisions is we want kids to be college and career ready by 10th grade, so that the second two years of high school students can focus on the pathway that they\u2019re interested in pursuing,\u201d Hise said.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint aims to meet this goal through curriculum changes in English and math in addition to apprenticeships and technical education programs.\nImplementing the Blueprint at the school level falls squarely on school administrators, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\u201cThere was no doubt that the Blueprint would be a part of this conference, and the understanding of the Blueprint is actually key,\u201d she said in an interview.\nAfter learning more about the Blueprint at the conference, some principals said they are hopeful that the reforms will address their schools\u2019 priorities.\nTeachers are struggling to make do with salaries in the current economy, said Principal Ryan Daniel of Fort Foote Elementary in Prince George\u2019s County.\u00a0\n\u201cI know a lot of my teachers have to have after-school jobs or second jobs to compensate for their salary,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint will raise the minimum salary for teachers to $60,000 across the state by 2026. And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.\n\u201cI am excited for the Blueprint for Maryland,\u201d said Sarah Bento, an assistant principal at Northern High School in Calvert County. \u201cThe Blueprint is really asking us to rethink what high school looks like and really make sure that we\u2019re preparing all of our students to be prepared to go to college or enter the workforce in a way that we just haven\u2019t done before.\u201d\u00a0\nThanks to the Blueprint, Bento\u2019s school has been able to hire a career advisor for the first time.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have 1,500 students and he\u2019s meeting with every single one of them to talk about career entrance and get them connected to the resources that are out there,\u201d she told the Local News Network.\u00a0\nOther schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still reading and learning, and I think that they\u2019re doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\u201d said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold, in Anne Arundel County. \u201cWe have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they\u2019re going to disseminate to us.\u201d\u00a0\nMiller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school\u2019s capacity to meet the need.\n\u201cI would love to have pre-K in our school,\u201d she said. \u201cEarly childhood is a love of mine, so I would love to. But our school building is very, very old and there\u2019s not a place for them.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s hard to implement policy changes while running the day-to-day operations of a school, said Miller.\u00a0\n\u201cSo I think the summertime will be a big focus for us when there aren\u2019t kids in the building and we\u2019ll be able to kind of digest it more and be taught exactly what the expectations are,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m eager to see how it all rolls out.\u201d\u00a0\nIn March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\u00a0\n\u201cThe plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\u201d Hise, of the Accountability and Implementation Board, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for more innovative thinking.\u201d\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board expects updated plans from every district in March 2024, and has offered every district a $100,000 grant to hire a strategic planning expert. All but Frederick and Worcester counties took the state up on that deal.\nThe Local News Network will follow the Blueprint rollout and an analysis of each district-level plan will be published in January on the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service website.",

    "summary": "Maryland's six largest public universities show significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic faculty, with less than 6% being Black and less than 5% Hispanic, despite the state being one of the most diverse in the U.S. A new education code implemented in 2022 aims to address this disparity by requiring universities to reflect the state's demographic diversity in their faculty, staff, and administration.",
    "content": "Black and Hispanic communities are underrepresented among university faculty at Maryland\u2019s six largest public universities, according to the 2021 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). This analysis does not include Maryland\u2019s online universities or historically black colleges and universities.\nIPEDS is an annual data collection system run through the U.S. Department of Education.\u00a0\nThese findings align with trends across the country, data shows. Maryland is the fourth most diverse U.S. state, according to the U.S. Census\u2019 diversity index, and the most diverse state on the East Coast, according to the U.S. News and World Report.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Census projects that 32% of Maryland\u2019s population are Black and 12% are Hispanic. At Maryland\u2019s six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs \u2013 University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Maryland, College Park; Towson University; Frostburg State University; Salisbury University and St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland\u2013 less than 6% of the total faculty are Black and less than 5% are Hispanic, as of 2021.\n\nAccording to Laura Perna, Vice Provost for Faculty at University of Pennsylvania and a researcher on college access, faculty underrepresentation is a widespread issue, though the specifics differ by university.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross Maryland, faculty demographics vary widely. At Towson University, 7% of faculty were Black in fall 2021 and 3% were Hispanic. At Frostburg State University, those numbers were about halved, with 4% Black faculty and almost 1% Hispanic faculty.\u00a0\nPrior to 2022, Maryland\u2019s education code allowed individual public universities to implement their own plans for \u201ccultural diversity,\u201d which ranged in length and breadth. In 2022, a new code was instituted, requiring public universities to ensure that faculty, staff, and administration demographics reflect the state\u2019s diverse population.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, the percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty at the universities included in the analysis both increased by just under a percentage point.\u00a0\n\u201cIt really is amazing how little progress there has been in some ways on this,\u201d said Perna.\nBut not unexpected, according to Perna. Because positions open when current faculty members retire, seeing an increase in representation might take time.\u00a0\nAccording to Dr. Kimberly Griffin, Dean of University of Maryland\u2019s College of Education, many people assume that faculty will diversify alongside the student body. This \u201ctrickle up\u201d system is unrealistic, she says.\u00a0\nThe problem is multifaceted, says Griffin. Academia is tasked with generating a pool, hiring inclusively, yielding candidates, onboarding hirees, retaining them, and ultimately, promoting them. \u201cWe have to do more in all of those spaces,\u201d says Griffin, whose research has, for years, focused on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in post-secondary education.\u00a0\nAccording to Perna, one roadblock is \u201cinvisible labor\u201d; faculty of color often take on work that requires time and energy, but does not fit academia\u2019s standard promotion metrics.\u00a0\n\u201cWe should be looking at to what extent our definition of merit is very narrow,\u201d said Perna. \nUnderrepresented minorities often spend more time serving on committees and mentoring students of color, labor that often goes unrecognized, says Perna. Come time for promotions, publications and course evaluations are weighted more heavily.\u00a0\nResearch may also go unappreciated. According to Griffin, members of minority groups often pursue research in applied topics, like solutions to community issues.\n\u201cBias that we have around what good work looks like, and what\u2019s meaningful can shape how the tenure and promotion cases of women and men of color are perceived,\u201d Griffin says.\u00a0\nAs the student body has diversified, the gap between representation among students and faculty has widened, straining faculty of color.\u00a0\nAs of fall 2021, Black students made up 17% and Hispanic students made up 8% of the student body at the universities included in the CNS analysis. That was an increase of 10% and 19% since 2016, respectively. Faculty demographics remained stable.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021, the resulting ratio of Black students to Black faculty members was 60:1. The ratio of white students to white faculty members was 15:1.\nAccording to Griffin, while it\u2019s crucial for students of color to have role models and mentors of color, there isn\u2019t enough faculty of color to shoulder that responsibility alone. \u201cThat\u2019s a load everyone should share,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA lack of diversity also impacts faculty of color pursuing tenure. At Maryland\u2019s six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs,\u00a0 in 2021, 71% of tenured professors were white, 5% Black, and 4% were Hispanic, according to IPEDS.\u00a0\n\nAcross all six universities in 2021, there were 104 tenured Black professors, an increase of 3 professors from 2016, according to IPEDS. There were 10 more Black faculty members and 16 more Hispanic faculty members in tenure track positions than in 2016.\u00a0\nA lack of diversity among tenured faculty can make it harder for some faculty of color to find mentors as they pursue tenure, though many members of academia, like Griffin, are trying to combat this by developing intentional mentoring policy.\n\u201cMentorship that helps you build a sense of connection and community in your unit and in your college is also really important for helping folks get to tenure,\u201d said Griffin.\u00a0\nTenure and tenure track positions provide more job security than other faculty roles. In Maryland in 2021, 38% of Hispanic faculty and 30% of Black faculty were not tenured or on tenure track compared to 27% of white faculty.\u00a0\nKatharina Maisel, a bioengineering professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, co-authored a list of best practices for increasing diversity alongside several other faculty members in the STEM field.\u00a0\nAccording to Maisel, diversifying the faculty, especially tenure and tenure track, takes intention at every stage of the process, from inviting people to apply, inviting people for internships, and checking your shortlist to make sure you\u2019re not just inviting people from Ivy League schools.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s possible.\u00a0\nIn science, technology, engineering, and math, says Maisel, a tendency to be overspecific in job listings can discourage faculty from underrepresented backgrounds. Being more broad can cut through imposter syndrome and help develop a wider applicant pool.\nUsing rubrics to evaluate a candidate for hiring or promotion can help ensure an objective set of criteria, helping reel in internal biases, Maisel said.\n\u201cIf you as a department are really actively interested in increasing the diversity of your faculty, there are things you can do,\u201d Maisel said.",

    "summary": "In Carroll County, 56 books were temporarily removed from school libraries following complaints about inappropriate content, with a majority written by female, LGBTQIA+, and non-binary authors featuring diverse characters. The challenges, led by conservative group Moms for Liberty, focused on what they deemed as \"graphic sex\" content, aiming to address concerns related to the mental health crisis among youth.",
    "content": "Last month, Carroll County\u2019s Board of Education temporarily removed 56 books from the district\u2019s school libraries after complaints about inappropriate content. An analysis by Capital News Service (CNS) found that a high proportion of the titles being reviewed were written by female, LGBTQIA+ and non-binary authors and featured LGBTQIA+ characters and characters of color.\nCNS collected data about the authors and content of the 56 books being challenged from author websites, publisher websites, book synopsis and other online sources.\nThere are 43 different authors of the 56 books being challenged. The data collected by CNS shows a majority, 67%, of the authors are female. Despite only accounting for less than 2% of U.S. adults according to Pew Research Center survey data, non-binary authors make up 12% of the book authors.\n\n\n\nLGBTQIA+ writers and illustrators make up 28%, despite the LGBTQIA+ community representing only about 7% of the U.S. adult population, according to Pew Research Center.\nMany of the titles up for review also include diverse characters.\nAccording to the CNS analysis, of the 56 books temporarily removed, at least 25 contain LGBTQIA+ characters and at least 16 include characters of color.\n\n\n\nThe challenges were driven by Moms for Liberty, a conservative group focusing on parents\u2019 rights that, according to The Washington Post, has been responsible for a surge of book challenges across the United States in recent years.\nMoms for Liberty\u2019s Carroll County Chair, and mother of five, Kit Hart has attended various school board meetings to speak about the issue of having books in school libraries that have what the group deemed \u201cgraphic sex\u201d content.\n\u201cThe only criteria that we used to identify these books was that they contained very graphic sex or rape, that was the only criteria that we use, it wasn\u2019t anything else,\u201d Hart said.\nHart said there is already a mental health crisis in the U.S. and the group wants to help identify some of the factors which could be contributing.\n\u00a0\u201cWe believe that this type of material can be very upsetting and problematic to students, and it\u2019s not developing any kind of literacy that they need, and it can really damage their mental health,\u201d Hart said.\nMoms for Liberty points to the website BookLooks.org when evaluating books. It provides detailed reports of what they consider objectionable content and ratings for specific books. Some of the concerns listed in the reports include \u201calternate sexualities\u201d and \u201calternate gender ideologies.\u201d\nBookLooks also lists various types of \u201ccontroversial commentary\u201d that they believe children and young adults shouldn\u2019t have access to, including themes about race, culture, politics, religion, abortion and more.\n\n\n\nOut of the challenged books, 28% contain LGBTQIA+ themes, and 14% include non-binary themes, according to BookLooks.\nA book that discusses both sexuality and gender ideology is \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d by George M. Johnson, who is a queer Black man. He wrote a series of essays about his \u201ctrials and triumphs\u201d growing up in New Jersey and Virginia. With 86 challenges, it was the second-most challenged book in the country in 2022, according to the American Library Association (ALA).\nSome parents, like Carroll County resident and mom of two Pamela Hohlbein, worry the removal would result in children having limited access to diverse voices and perspectives.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bAt the end of the day, these book bans are affecting kids, who are not really kids anymore. They\u2019re teenagers, they\u2019re young adults. They need to learn about the world, not just this little Carroll County bubble that everyone seems to think is protecting the kids,\u201d said Hohlbein. \u201cBut when they get off into the real world, and they don\u2019t know about other cultures, and they don\u2019t know how to interact with the LGBTQ community or the BIPOC community, it\u2019s really going to harm them in the long run.\u201d\nHart said she agrees that students should be exposed to different people, cultures and lifestyles in their reading but does not see why sexual content has to be included in some works.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t include that sexual content in the books. \u2026 They should be able to be exposed to all different kinds of people without being exposed to sexual content at the same time,\u201d Hart said.\nAccording to BookLooks, some 96% of the books challenged in Carroll County include forms of sexual content, with 38% discussing sexual assault.\nOne of these books being flagged for containing sexual assault is \u201cA Stolen Life: A Memoir\u201d by Jaycee Lee Dugard, who wrote about her experience of abuse and survival after being kidnapped and held in captivity for 18 years.\nWendy Novak, a Carroll County resident and mom of three, said that books writt\u200b\u200ben by survivors of sexual assault about their experiences helped her understand what her own child went through, which she also spoke about at the September Board of Education meeting.\n\u201cI have a 25-year-old that was sexually assaulted, and for me, and I know it\u2019s true for other people, reading books by survivors helps to understand what my child went through,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThese books are available in high schools. They\u2019re not available in middle or elementary schools, but they\u2019re available at the age range that is unfortunately very likely to be assaulted.\u201d\nSome members of the Carroll County Public School\u2019s Board of Education have expressed support for the removal of the books.\nCarroll County Board of Education members Steve Whisler and Tara Battaglia both signed Moms For Liberty\u2019s \u201cParent Pledge,\u201d which states that they will \u201chonor the fundamental rights of parents including but not limited to the right to direct the education, medical care, and moral upbringing of their children.\u201d\nWhisler was also a speaker at Moms for Liberty\u2019s \u201cGiving Parents a Voice Townhall\u201d held in Silver Spring on Sept. 26, where he spoke about how much he values parental involvement.\nThe issue of book challenges exists beyond Carroll County. According to national data collected by the ALA\u2019s Office for Intellectual Freedom, in the first 8 months of 2023, 1,915 unique titles were targeted.\n\n\n\nAccording to the ALA, the number of unique titles challenged has increased by 20% this year from the same reporting period in 2022, which saw the highest number of challenges since the ALA started collecting the data 20 years ago.\nThe ALA found the recent rise in title challenges is often driven by a single person or group challenging multiple titles at a time.\nIn the first eight months of 2023, 11 states reported cases of a challenge to\u202f100 or more books, compared to six during the same reporting period in 2022 and zero in 2021, and that \u201c9 in 10 of the overall number of books challenged were part of an attempt to censor multiple titles,\u201d according to the ALA.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely the challenges will slow down soon. In nearby Harford County, Board of Education Vice President Melissa Hahn called out six books for being inappropriate for students at a recent board meeting.\nIn Carroll County, the school district\u2019s reconsideration committee will continue to review up to five books per month. According to The Baltimore Sun, school officials have decided to retain five of the books in high school libraries, including \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d by Stephen Chbosky, \u201cTilt\u201d by Ellen Hopkins, \u201cThe Sun and her Flowers\u201d by Rupi Kaur, \u201cNot that Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture\u201d by Roxane Gay, and \u201cSlaughterhouse Five\u201d by Kurt Vonnegut, though the books have not yet been returned to shelves as the decision is open to appeal. \u201cSlaughterhouse Five,\u201d an anti-war novel long considered a classic of American literature, has been permanently removed from middle school libraries in the county.\nDylan Manfre contributed to this story",

    "content": "LARGO, Md. \u2013 U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg presented grants to two Maryland community colleges Wednesday to help cover tuition in their commercial driver\u2019s license programs.\u00a0\nPrince George\u2019s County Community College and Community College of Baltimore County received $173,640 and $197,410 respectively, to help with the cost of tuition for veterans, refugees and the underserved. Gov. Wes Moore and staff from both schools attended the event in a PGCC parking lot.\n\u201cBefore the infrastructure law passed, even if the school qualified for these grants, students would still have to cover a lot of the tuition. Here at Prince George\u2019s, that comes roughly to about $4,000,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cWe\u2019re tearing down that barrier with federal funding so that they can get funded to come to an excellent institution like this.\u201d\nThe Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation is part of an ongoing effort to expand job opportunities within the trucking industry. This assistance is available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Buttigieg said. The law, officially known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, provides resources to fix decaying roads, bridges, waterways and rails, and boosts transit projects, broadband access and climate change resilience, among other things.\u00a0\nA commercial driver\u2019s license is required to operate large vehicles, including school buses, large delivery trucks, shuttles and tractor trailers, among others.\u00a0\n\u201cWe believe in veterans, and we believe in the importance of trucking, for the country, for our economic security, and for our future,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cYou in Maryland have a governor who understands the importance of infrastructure and of transportation in people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d\nBoth Buttigieg and Moore are veterans \u2013 Buttigieg was a naval officer and Moore served in the Army \u2013 and both were Rhodes scholars. The two announced in January a project to rebuild the 150-year-old B&P Tunnel in Baltimore, renaming it the Frederick Douglass Tunnel.\u00a0\nJames Brackins, 70, a recent graduate of the Commercial Driver\u2019s License program and an Army veteran, introduced Buttigieg to the crowd of under 100. Brackins joined the program as a part of his goal to build affordable housing in his hometown of Jonesville, Louisiana.\u00a0\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m one step closer to achieving that goal,\u201d said Brackins.\u201c It gives me great joy to know that others will be supported in their dreams, just as I have been supported thanks to PGCC.\u201d\nMoore and Buttigieg greeted staff and the CDL instructors and toured the commercial tractor trailers used in the program. PGCC partners with Mr. George\u2019s Driving School of Gaithersburg, which provides instructors and equipment for training.\u00a0\nAt one point, Moore hopped in the passenger seat of a commercial tractor trailer to ride along with a demonstration of driving through the parking lot and backing up between cones.\u00a0\nGov. Wes Moore rides with Prince George\u2019s County Community College commercial driving school student Carlos Sanchez Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023.

In his speech, Moore said his junior college experience was the foundation of his career.\n\u201cOur support for community colleges is not just everlasting, it\u2019s personal,\u201d said Moore.\u00a0\nIn 2023, PGCC\u2019s transportation, distribution and logistics departments trained more than 500 students and it has enrolled more than 300 more since July.\n\u201cMuch like the Department of Transportation, we, too, are committed to the mission of providing safe, efficient, sustainable and equitable commerce in our community,\u201d said Sherrie Johnson, vice president of external affairs, communications, and advancement at PGCC.\nButtigieg has been in Maryland since his Impact Maryland forum Tuesday, sponsored by The Baltimore Banner, where he addressed electric vehicles and transit infrastructure. During that event, the secretary was forced off the stage by climate protesters critical of a planned oil export facility near Houston.",

    "summary": "Charles County, along with nine other Maryland school districts, has sued major social media companies for allegedly targeting and manipulating youth, leading to classroom distractions and mental health issues. Teachers report that students are increasingly distracted by social media, lacking self-control and struggling with emotional expression, making it difficult to engage them in learning.",
    "content": "A \u201cboring and pointless\u201d education.\nThat\u2019s what students at Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, in Charles County, tell their English teacher Nicholas Gray they\u2019re receiving while they distract themselves with TikTok videos, \u201csnaps\u201d on Snapchat, and endless\u00a0scrolls through Instagram during class.\n\u201cIt is difficult to convince [students] that learning is more impactful and important than the brand new video that will entertain them,\u201d Gray said.\nWith that thought in mind, Charles County this month joined nine other Maryland school districts in a lawsuit against the world\u2019s social media giants: Google, Meta, ByteDance and Snap Inc. Other school districts in the state that have joined the court action are Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s and Talbot.\n\u201cHopefully this lawsuit provides pressure for some action in terms of how to better create products that are geared to children,\u201d said Maria Navarro, superintendent of Charles County Public Schools.\nA classroom distraction\nThe lawsuit accused several social media platforms of targeting and manipulating youth so they stay engaged for excessive amounts of time \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what educators see in Charles County classrooms.\n\u201c(Social media is) a huge distraction in our schools and in our classrooms,\u201d said Cheryl Davis, principal of Henry E. Lackey High School.\nThe teachers do their part to plan effective, instructional uses for technology in the classroom, Davis said, but personal devices get in the way.\nGray said he prohibits the use of cell phones during instructional times and tries to create engaging lessons so that students will not be tempted to use their devices or go on social media. However, he said, the biggest problem plaguing his students is self control and their failure to regulate personal behavior.\n\u201cStudents are lacking the ability to express their emotions in a positive way,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe see a lot more negative expressions.\u201d\nStudents have gotten more angry and aggressive, Davis said. In a developmental part of their lives, they often fail to pause for a moment and look for resources or constructive ways to express their emotions.\n\u201cThere is no respite,\u201d Gray said. \u201cStudents leave for the day and the talking/anger continues onto Instagram or Snapchat, and then the students come to school upset over what is on social media.\u201d\nSeveral Charles County educators said more physical altercations have occurred because of social media conflicts.\n\u201cSnapchat scares me,\u201d said Brian Street, a father of two Piccowaxen middle schoolers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several fights at school on Snapchat.\u201d\nOn top of that, two staff members at St. Charles High School were injured Thursday after they intervened in a physical altercation between students that started over a social media post, according to a letter that Principal Tammika Little sent out to parents.\n\u201cPlease monitor your child\u2019s electronic devices and social media accounts,\u201d Little said.\nThe mental health impact\nNot surprisingly, school officials in Charles County and elsewhere are alarmed at how social media affects child development and mental health. \u00a0That concern is also reflected in the lawsuit, which alleges that companies are aware of the negative impacts the platforms have on children\u2019s mental health, but they choose to prioritize profit.\nStudents go through developmental changes from elementary school to middle school, where their focus shifts from their parents to their peer group. Navarro said this is when children start pushing their own boundaries and understanding how to become an adult.\nAs students become more self-sufficient, they begin building confidence \u2013 but social media usage during this stage can interrupt a child\u2019s growth, Navarro said.\n\u201cA fake reality, at those pivotal developmental ages, has more of an impact on behavioral health,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIt also isolates you.\u201d\nNavarro said social media augments the insecurities children face at pivotal ages, and research seems to prove that point. Researchers at Facebook found that Instagram, in 2021, made one in three girls feel worse about their bodies, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic further isolated children and left many in a more fragile mental state. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14.\nCharles County educators said social media contributes to the mental health crises that some young people endure. Inappropriate social media interactions continue to create disruptions in the buildings all over the county because children these ages are not developmentally ready for the responsibility, Davis said.\n\u201cStudents lack the maturity to be able to handle social media,\u201d Davis said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u00a0\nThat being the case, Davis said schools must make mental health a priority or else their true purpose will not be achieved.\n\u201cWe are here to educate students,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf students are not in the right mindset, then it\u2019s much more difficult for them to access education.\u201d\nSearching for solutions\nWhile voicing support for the lawsuit, Charles County educators are looking elsewhere for more prompt solutions to the problems social media causes in the classroom.\nDavis pushed for parents to be a part of the solution.\n\u201cYou pay for the phone, you own the phone, put some apps on there that allow you to control access,\u201d Davis said.\nParents should be monitoring their kids\u2019 devices to make sure they\u2019re safe, Davis said, and it is not just her who feels this way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a school thing, it\u2019s a parent thing,\u201d Street said.\nHe said that while he does monitor his kids\u2019 social media usage, it is a parents\u2019 decision on how active they want to be in controlling it.\nNavarro said CCPS has many resources for parents to learn how to be tech savvy so they know how to keep their children safe. In addition to limiting screen time, she said parents should be encouraging their kids to physically play, talk and participate in sports and extracurricular activities with other kids.\nNavarro said when to allow children to have devices is a parent\u2019s choice.\n\u201cMy job is to inform and educate them about the implications of those decisions,\u201d Navarro said. She said she wants students to reach their full potential, but right now social media makes it harder for them to do that.\nThat\u2019s where the lawsuit could help.\nNavarro said that if the district gets any compensation from this lawsuit, the school system intends to expand resources for the growing needs of behavioral health.\nAnd even in these early stages, Navarro said, the lawsuit serves an important purpose.\n\u201cIt sends a message,\u201d she said.\nThe message: that everyone \u2013 from social media companies to educators to parents to students \u2013 must be alert to the harm that social media can do to young people.",

    "summary": "Audits in Maryland have uncovered significant issues with school district contracting, including a case where over $320,000 was stolen through misuse of purchasing cards and mismanagement of bus contracts. Despite regular audits, many districts fail to implement recommended solutions, leading to repeated findings of financial mismanagement.",
    "content": "Auditors keep a close eye on school district contracting in Maryland \u2014 and if you\u2019re wondering why, just look at what happened in May in Montgomery County.\nAfter auditors raised suspicions, the district\u2019s former assistant director of transportation pleaded guilty to stealing over $320,000 from the county\u2019s school system over a span of at least five years by misusing district purchasing cards and mismanaging a contract for the purchase of school buses.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, several state audits in recent years raised serious questions about contract spending in other Maryland public school districts. Richard P. Henry, Maryland\u2019s inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\u201d Henry said.\nCounty or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland. On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.\nBut audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions \u2014 and often they don\u2019t. The Office of Legislative Audits released an audit of the Maryland State Department of Education in January. Auditors found 171 repeated findings that local school systems had yet to address from previous audits.\u00a0\nThat audit recommended the Department of Education establish a monitoring process. The department agreed to assess whether it\u2019s feasible to require school districts to issue progress reports that track whether they are following their auditors\u2019 recommendations.\nMatthew Streett, assistant director of the Compliance and Performance Audit Division in the Office of Legislative Audits, said school districts should take audit findings seriously.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to safeguard the assets because ultimately, when you\u2019re talking about money that flows through the school system, it\u2019s all intended to help educate the students, and if money is being diverted, it\u2019s less money that\u2019s intended for the classroom and students,\u201d Streett said.\nPublic school districts in Montgomery County, Baltimore City, Howard County, Charles County and Calvert County have all been audited in recent years. Concerns raised in those audits range from unauthorized transactions to insufficient documentation to justify major purchases.\nIn addition, the audits found that nearly every school district failed to complete proper documentation for approval of intergovernmental purchasing agreements. In many cases, employees made purchases without documenting why they were necessary and beneficial to the district.\nHere\u2019s a detailed look at what auditors and investigators found in recent years in those individual school districts:\nMontgomery County\nAuditors have found a number of issues with school district contracting in Montgomery County, but none more serious than the one that led to guilty pleas from two district transportation department officials this year.\nIn May, Charles Ewald, the district\u2019s former assistant transportation director, pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of misconduct in office.\u00a0\nCourt records said Ewald used his position to request checks from an \u201coff-the-books\u201d account held by one of the district\u2019s longtime bus vendors, American Truck & Bus Inc. The money came from late fee and change fee reimbursements owed to the district \u2014 and, according to court documents, $352,568.68 of it went directly to Ewald\u2019s bank account. In addition, Ewald had the bus vendor issue about $16,000 in checks to other school district staff members.\nTodd Watkins, the former director of the transportation department, pleaded guilty in June to one count of misconduct in office, and not just because he failed to fulfill his role of overseeing the department\u2019s expenses. Watkins was the one who coordinated with American Truck & Bus to establish the \u201coff-the-books\u201d account, court records said.\nWatkins received over $13,000 using the account and intentionally violated the district\u2019s reimbursement policy, but he provided documentation for those payments and was not charged with theft.\u00a0\nA judge will sentence Ewald and Watkins in September, closing a criminal case that began with an internal review in 2021.\nThen last December, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General found that school district transportation department officials used school funds to pay for a NASCAR headset, drag racing tires, a sport loop band for an Apple Watch, a car roof rack for kayaks, Home Depot and Amazon gift cards, along with other personal items. The purchases totaled nearly $5,000.\nAlso late last year, the state Office of Legislative Audits weighed in with its look at how Montgomery County Public Schools do business, finding other concerns far beyond the district\u2019s transportation department.\nFor example, auditors found the county failed to complete state-mandated written assessments for three intergovernmental contract agreements worth a combined $20.9 million. District officials did not make sure the invoice pricing matched the agreed contract; instead, they relied on informal proposals and internet searches to determine whether they were getting the right prices.\nAuditors also found several problems with district construction contracts:\n\nThe district was missing critical documentation to justify their award of five contracts valued at over $150 million. This included information on losing bidders, selection criteria and evidence of selection committee evaluations.\nSchool officials took no consideration of price, as required by law, in selecting some contracts. District officials awarded the contract without documenting how they agreed upon the prices.\nEight procurements valued at $190 million were never put up for bid on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage, despite the law requiring any procurement or award over $50,000 to be published and put up for competitive bidding.\nOn the construction sites themselves, school district officials repeatedly neglected to complete daily inspections to make sure the work was being done correctly on eight contracts totaling $181.8 million.\n\nIn response to the audit, Montgomery County Public Schools officials confirmed all the findings were factually accurate and outlined procedures they planned to implement to correct the problems.\nBaltimore City\nThe Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education reported in May that Baltimore City schools overpaid taxi vendors by more than $695,000.\nThe district contracted taxis to transport students with extenuating circumstances, such as those with disabilities, in foster care, or who lack safe walking or bus routes to school.\u00a0\nDistrict officials approved billing based on a voucher system that required a signature from the taxi driver and the student (or their guardian) upon completion of the ride. However, according to the investigation, some taxi drivers forged vouchers to bill the district for rides that never happened.\nThe bulk of those overcharges involved the city\u2019s Yellow Cab Co. and the company that bought it in 2021, zTrip. Yellow Cab filed vouchers totaling $512,990.42 in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years that were not supported by student attendance records, the audit said. zTrip acquired Yellow Cab in September 2021, and the audit said the company had another $118,556.72 in unsupported voucher claims in the 2021-2022 school year.\nAuditors found several instances of billed rides from Yellow Cab and zTrip that did not match student attendance records. For example, in one case, there were 18 roundtrips recorded for a student during February 2022. Yet attendance records showed the student only attended school nine times that month.\nThe investigation also found transportation charges for students that were no longer attending Baltimore City schools. Between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years, there were filings for a total of 25 students after they transferred schools or withdrew from the district. Additionally, 46 high school seniors were named on vouchers in June despite graduating in May.\nThe other four cab vendors servicing the district collectively accounted for a little over $64,000 of the total discrepancies, which auditors said did not warrant further investigation.\nSonja B. Santelises, CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools, wrote a letter responding to the audit. She noted the district\u2019s taxi ridership decreased by 90% for the 2022-2023 school year compared to 2018-2019, serving fewer than 100 students, which allowed for closer monitoring and fewer discrepancies.\nSantelises argued the district is not the only one to blame.\n\u201cCity Schools has prioritized increasing our oversight of transportation vendors in recent years, despite the state\u2019s long-standing and well-documented legacy of systemic underfunding and the resulting limited resources for additional monitoring,\u201d she wrote.\nHoward County\nThe state Office of Legislative Audits, in a report issued in April, found the Howard County Public School System has significantly improved its financial oversight but auditors have concerns over the district\u2019s procurement practices, contract bids, and processes for monitoring payments for transportation and health care.\nThe prior audit, conducted in 2016, found issues ranging from unreported salaries to incomplete inventories of technology equipment. Since then, auditors said, Howard County has successfully addressed six of the eight issues found.\nDespite the county\u2019s progress, the most recent audit highlighted a few problem areas.\nThe county violated state law by failing to publish some contract bids and awards on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage. The Office of Legislative Audits tested 10 contracts totaling $35.7 million and four of those contracts totaling $18.7 million were never published. Therefore, the county did not give other contractors the opportunity to bid in those instances.\nThe district failed to audit the third-party administrator that made health care payments on the district\u2019s behalf. As a result, district officials can\u2019t be sure whether care was actually administered and billed accurately, auditors said.\nThe audit does not identify that third-party administrator, but in an email to the Local News Network, a district spokesman identified the company that managed the district\u2019s health care programs at the time as Kelly & Associates Insurance Group. The district paid $746.5 million over those four years to Kelly, making it one of the highest-paid school district contractors in the state.\nCharles County\nState auditors reported in January that Charles County school officials don\u2019t adequately supervise the use of district-issued credit cards.\nThey issued the cards to departments and schools with credit limits ranging from $1,000 to $50,000. The transactions on these cards totaled $687,000 in fiscal year 2021.\nSince multiple employees have access to each card, it is difficult to determine who is responsible for any fraudulent charges, auditors said.\nIn addition, supervisors are not using Level-3 data to analyze transaction logs. Level-3 data are detailed descriptions of purchases provided by merchants, which would make it easier to identify suspicious charges.\nCharles County school officials also could not produce a reasonable justification for why they spent $6 million for bus maintenance costs in fiscal year 2019.\nThe district agreed that all the audit\u2019s findings were factually accurate. However, district officials noted risk-reducing procedures they have in place for credit cards and included a more detailed cost breakdown of bus vendor fees.\nCalvert County\nThe state Office of Legislative Audits reported in January 2022 that Calvert County Public Schools took shortcuts in the spending approval process and failed to monitor whether their vendors were billing them correctly.\nThe lack of oversight on the district\u2019s financial systems also allowed individual departments and schools to make purchases while skipping necessary procurement processes, auditors said.\nAuditors also raised questions about the district\u2019s transportation costs. Compared to other comparable-sized districts, Calvert County schools paid 22 cents per mile more for transportation.\nIn addition, the district also paid over a half-million dollars in bus operations fees without providing any reasonable justification for these transportation costs.\nOn other contracts, the district didn\u2019t check to see if the price written on the invoice from vendors matched the pricing agreed to in the contract. The audit found five payments in intergovernmental contract agreements that added up to $642,000 that were vaguely detailed or had different product descriptions.\nThe district also allowed a third party to pay out medical claims without ever ensuring the services were provided and appropriately priced.\nCalvert County Public Schools accepted the audit results and said it would address the issues.",

This project, which includes data from all 24 public school districts and covers contracts over $25,000, aims to increase transparency and help identify potential corruption in school funding.",
    "content": "Billions of local, state and federal tax dollars go to funding Maryland\u2019s public schools every year \u2014 and now, it will be easier for you to find out how your local school district spent that money.\nThat\u2019s because the Local News Network at the University of Maryland has published an easily searchable database where you can look up your school district\u2019s vendor payments over the past four years.\u00a0\nThat database and an accompanying series of stories comprise \u201cContracted Out,\u201d a project compiled over the past seven months by students and faculty at the UMD Philip Merrill College of Journalism. The \u201cContracted Out\u201d database provides a comprehensive and unprecedented itemization of school contract spending statewide.\n\u201cIf there is any corruption out there, it\u2019s through these contracts,\u201d said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\n\u201cContracted Out\u201d gives local journalists and the general public something they\u2019ve never had before: an easy way to review school district vendor payments.\nThe \u201cContracted Out\u201d database contains information from all 24 public school districts in Maryland, with the ability to break out individual districts. The database includes every vendor that was paid over $25,000 by each district between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.\nThe Local News Network turned more than 26,000 rows of raw data into news the public can use. School district payments for health insurance, buses, computers and meals \u2014 it\u2019s all there.\nStill, there are limits to the data:\n\nVendor payments account for only a small portion of school funding in Maryland or any other state. Roza said the vast majority of school spending \u2014 80% to 90% of it \u2014 goes to teacher and staff salaries, not vendors.\nThe data used to construct the \u201cContracted Out\u201d database \u2014 most of it obtained through the state\u2019s Open Data Portal \u2014 lacks detail. Most districts only have to report payments of more than $25,000, the name of the vendor and the zip code where the vendor is based. A quirk in state law\u00a0requires only Baltimore County Public Schools to say why they spent what they spent.\nSchool districts have differing policies regarding which services they contract out and which they handle in-house. For example, some districts have their own bus fleets while others hire contractors to transport students.\u00a0\nDistricts also disagree on what constitutes a vendor payment. Most notably, some list state and federal taxes as vendor payments, but others exclude them from the data. For that reason, any district-by-district comparison of overall vendor payments would not be statistically valid.\n\nEven so, the data that\u2019s online serves a useful purpose, said Matthew Streett, assistant director in the state\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits.\n\u201cI look at it from a transparency and accountability standpoint,\u201d Streett said. \u201cThe public wants to know where their taxpayer dollars are going when it comes to educating students.\u201d\nStreett\u2019s office routinely audits school district spending, as do district officials and inspector general offices in individual counties. Meanwhile, the Office of the State Inspector General for Education performs audits based on tips about possible wrongdoing. You can find details about some of the recent audits here.\nThose audits can spot big trouble. For example, an internal review of contracting in Montgomery County Public Schools last year found evidence of irregularities in the district\u2019s transportation department. A criminal investigation then led to a guilty plea to a felony theft charge by the department\u2019s former assistant director, as well as a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge by the department\u2019s former director.\nBut the checks and balances on school spending don\u2019t depend primarily on auditors and investigators. School boards review and authorize vendor payments, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\n\u201cMaryland procurement laws apply to school districts,\u201d he said. \u201cSchool districts can\u2019t go out and stroke a million-dollar check to a vendor without going through a bid process.\u201d\nBut Roza said school boards rarely go over vendor contracts line by line.\u00a0\n\u201cThey end up going into a consent agenda, and the whole board goes, \u2018Everybody want to approve the 91 contracts that we have coming before the board this month? All in favor? Aye,\u2019\u201d she said.\nIn most states, those contracts are published only in a school board\u2019s minutes, not online like in Maryland, Roza said.\nBut the Local News Network found big problems with the school contracting data on the state\u2019s Open Data Portal.\u00a0\nWhen work on the project began in January, huge chunks of data from four of the five largest school districts in the state were missing. Data was missing from several smaller districts, too \u2014 even though a 2019 act of the General Assembly requires districts to report vendor payments of over $25,000 with the Department of Budget and Management.\nStudent journalists and Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski spent months prodding districts to comply with the law and provide the missing data. The last to do so, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, didn\u2019t do that until early June.\nDerek Willis, lecturer in computational and data journalism at Merrill College, then completed the work his students had begun: cleaning up the data so that every vendor was listed by the same name.\nA team of 38 student journalists reviewed the incomplete data before the spring semester ended and Zremski studied the late-arriving data.\u00a0\nTheir key findings will be included in the accompanying stories, but local journalists around the state and citizens may also want to take a close look at the data. As Roza noted, the people closest to the local school districts \u2014 reporters and citizens who live in those districts \u2014 will be the ones most likely to spot questionable vendor payments.\nIn doing so, Roza said, people should remember one thing about school district vendor data: scandal can be rooted in them. She cited a case from Chicago, where the former CEO of the public school district ended up spending nearly three years in federal prison because she steered tens of millions in no-bid contracts to her friends.\nAnd Richard Henry, the state\u2019s inspector general for education, encouraged the public to contact his office if they see anything in the contracting data that seems suspicious.\n\u201cI always encourage individuals to give us a call, and if they want to remain anonymous, they can remain anonymous,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWe continue to encourage outreach to all members of the education profession throughout the state and throughout the county governments to report any type of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based in part on the work of 38 Philip Merrill College of Journalism students who were enrolled in a mid-level reporting class in the spring semester. Kara Thompson of the Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau and Joel Lev-Tov, an independent study student with the Local News Network, contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Maryland\u2019s public school districts spent $21.1 billion on non-salary expenses between 2019 and 2022, with health care costs topping the list. The data, compiled from over 26,000 vendor payments of $25,000 or more, reflects a significant influx of federal pandemic relief funds but offers limited pre-pandemic spending comparisons due to reporting requirements.",
    "content": "With employee health care costs leading the way, Maryland\u2019s public school districts spent $21.1 billion between fiscal years 2019 and 2022 not on teacher and staff salaries, but on everything else that keeps the schools running.\nThat\u2019s the bottom line if you add up all 26,000-plus vendor payments of $25,000 or more made by Maryland\u2019s school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.\nThose vendor payments are included in \u201cContracted Out,\u201d a deep dive into school contract spending assembled by the Local News Network at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.\n\u201cContracted Out\u201d comes in the wake of an unprecedented influx of federal funding into Maryland\u2019s school districts. The federal government has sent more than $3.2 billion in COVID-19 pandemic relief funds to Maryland schools since 2020, with few strings attached. Much of that money will be reflected in the school spending data.\n\u201cThe last couple of years are super interesting because districts got this massive windfall of cash,\u201d said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\nBut the data \u2014 compiled largely from the state\u2019s Open Data Portal \u2014 offers only limited insights into overall spending patterns.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because only a small number of Maryland school districts published vendor data until the General Assembly required them to do so starting in 2019, meaning there\u2019s no way to compare spending from before the pandemic with spending in recent years.\u00a0\nOn top of that, under state law, 23 of the state\u2019s 24 school districts don\u2019t have to publicly report the reasons for their vendor payments.\nEven so, the \u201cContracted Out\u201d data shows all of the following to be major expenses for Maryland school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years::\nHealth care\nCareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which provides health insurance to many Maryland school employees, by far ranks as the biggest vendor for the state\u2019s school districts. The data shows that CareFirst pulled in $3.3 billion from Maryland\u2019s school districts between fiscal years 2019 and 2022.\u00a0\nNo other vendor comes close, but several other health care providers or insurers \u2014 including Express Scripts, Aetna, CVS Caremark, Cigna and SilverScript \u2014 each did more than $200 million in business with Maryland public schools over four years.\nHowever, some significant health care spending doesn\u2019t immediately stand out in the data. Allegany County Public Schools, for example, paid $79.7 million to Citibank over four years, but it was all for health care. The district simply uses a Citibank account to pay what it owes to Cigna, its health insurer, said Larry McKenzie, the district\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really unusual, especially for a large employer,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cWe have a custodial account, basically, set up with Citibank that Cigna uses to pay our claims on our behalf.\u201d\nSome other districts pay for their employee health care through a shared account that shows up on the county budget rather than the school district budget, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\nConstruction\nEvery school district in the state manages multiple buildings, and some larger districts find themselves serving increasingly large student populations. That being the case, five construction contractors did more than $150 million of business with Maryland school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 fiscal years. They are Keller Brothers, HESS Construction & Engineering Services, Oak Contracting, Dustin Construction and Whiting-Turner Contracting.\nMontgomery County Public Schools had among the most robust construction programs, with Keller Brothers and Dustin ranking as its top contractors. Jessica M. Baxter, a spokeswoman for the district, listed two dozen construction or renovation projects managed by those two companies in Montgomery County, the state\u2019s largest school district, with more than 160,000 students.\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools spent more than $150 million on construction, yet still ended up spending the most in the state \u2014 $13.8 million \u2014 on temporary classrooms from a company called Modular Genius.\n\u201cThis speaks to school overcrowding, displacement due to school construction, enrollment increases/overutilization rates,\u201d said Meghan Gebreselassie, the district\u2019s director of communications.\nTechnology\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a big boost in spending on technology at many school districts in the state \u2014 and to a lot of business for tech companies.\nTen IT service and equipment companies did at least $35 million in business with Maryland school districts over four years, with CDW Government Inc., a tech services provider to every school district in the state, leading the way with $331.9 million.\u00a0\nAmong manufacturers, Hewlett Packard ranked as the top vendor, receiving $147 million from Maryland school districts over four years. All of that business came from Baltimore County Public Schools.\n\u201cBCPS was among the first and largest school systems in the state to commit to and implement a program through which every student had access to a personal PC,\u201d said Charles Herndon, a spokesman for Baltimore County Public Schools. \u201cAlso included in the amount was other educational technical hardware, networking systems and PC leasing, among other expenses.\u201d\nOther tech companies benefited, too. Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools spent $61.3 million on Dell products and $15.6 million on Apple.\nThanks to the pandemic, \u201cwe had to purchase over 150,000 Dell Chromebooks in order to meet the needs of students,\u201d said Gebreselassie. In addition, she said \u201cPGCPS utilizes iPads for early childhood education and purchased over 19,000 of them to support students during distance learning.\u201d\nBasic operations\nAbout 890,000 students attend public schools in Maryland, and it costs billions to transport them, feed them and give them the materials they need in order to learn. So here\u2019s a quick look at what the vendor records show about those expenses:\n\nDistricts take different approaches to transporting students. Half the districts in the state did business with American Truck & Bus Inc., a bus dealer that ended up getting $79.4 million in business from the schools. But other districts, such as Carroll County Public Schools, rely on private bus operators \u2014 and two of them, Lawrence M. Schaffer and Mark C. Garcia, got $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, from that school district.\nFour food suppliers \u2014 Dori Foods, US Foods, Eastern Food Services and Cloverland Dairy \u2014 rank among the largest 100 school vendors in the state. But there are dozens of others, as districts tend to rely on small local produce and dairy providers as well as big national food distributors.\nAmazon ranked as one of the state\u2019s leading office suppliers, with $14.2 million in business over three years. That\u2019s half of what the districts gave to Office Depot, but rural districts tended more often to buy from Amazon. Garrett County, for example, spent $1.4 million on Amazon over four years. \u201cGarrett County is a rural county with limited options for purchasing locally,\u201d said Mark Greene, the district\u2019s manager of communications and public relations.\n\nCharter schools\nMaryland\u2019s public school districts didn\u2019t spend nearly as much money on charter schools as they did on basic operations. But they did spend at least $228.9 million on them over four years.\nThat figure comes from cross-referencing the vendor data submitted by Maryland\u2019s school districts with the list of charter schools published on the State Department of Education website.\nCharter schools are publicly funded institutions that operate independently from many state regulations, but are held to certain educational standards set out in their founding document, or charter. They do not charge tuition and are mandated to be secular, and they aim to give parents a choice of where their children should go to school.\nIn total, around 3% of the state\u2019s student population attends one of Maryland\u2019s 48 recognized charter schools, according to the State Department of Education. But in Baltimore City, they make up a much larger portion of the educational landscape. Baltimore City contains 31 charter schools, serving nearly one-fifth of the district\u2019s student population.\nThe district \u201chas been open to innovative ways to meet the diverse needs of students even before charter law was established in the state of Maryland,\u201d said Sherry Christian, the Baltimore City Public Schools media and public relations manager.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based on reporting from CNS reporters Sarah Meklir, Matthew Landsman and Joey Barke.",

Other surprising expenditures include catering at an Italian restaurant and retirement gifts from a local jewelry store.",
    "content": "If you take a look at some of the ways Maryland school districts spend your tax dollars, you may be left with an obvious question:\nWhy?\nIn one major case, it\u2019s not a question the spokesman for Anne Arundel County Public Schools was willing to answer. As a result, the third-largest school expenditure in the state remains unexplained.\nHowever, other school districts explained far smaller but surprising expenses for catering at an Italian restaurant chain and retirement gifts at a local jewelry store.\nHere is a look at some of the most mysterious expenses the Local News Network found when examining more than 26,000 vendor payments of $25,000 or more made by Maryland\u2019s school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years:\nIn Anne Arundel County, the school district paid $694.1 million to something called \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program.\u201d\nIt\u2019s common for people, businesses and government entities to transfer funds electronically. That\u2019s what happens, for example, if you pay your bills online. But bank statements specify who got paid via electronic transfer. They don\u2019t do what the Anne Arundel school district did, which is simply note that a huge amount of money has been transferred electronically without any clear indication of why or where it was transferred.\nMysterious as it is, Anne Arundel\u2019s \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program\u201d ranked as the third-highest-paid public school vendor in the state, behind CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and Kelly & Associates Insurance Group.\nThe Local News Network contacted Bob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, multiple times to inquire about the \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program\u201d and what it pays for.\u00a0\nAt first, Mosier promised answers \u2014 but then he stopped responding to emails. As a result, Anne Arundel County\u2019s biggest vendor outlay remains a mystery.\nIn Howard County, the public school system paid $746.5 million over those four years to Kelly & Associates Insurance Group. That made Kelly & Associates the second-highest-paid vendor among the 6,009 companies that did business with Maryland school districts between financial years 2019 and 2022.\n\u201cPrior to this fiscal year, we used Kelly & Associates Insurance Group to manage the payments for each of our benefit providers (medical, dental, vision, etc.) and Kelly & Associates Financial to manage all employee/employer payroll taxes and garnishments,\u201d said Brian Bassett, director of communication and engagement for the Howard County Public School System.\nWhile the Local News Network\u2019s \u201cContracted Out\u201d project focuses on school expenses between fiscal years 2019 and 2022, one 2018 expenditure stood out In Baltimore County \u2014 where a $1.57 million payment went to an \u201cunknown vendor.\u201d\nIn other words, district officials don\u2019t know exactly where $1.57 million went. Charles Herndon, a spokesman for the district, blamed it on a massive ransomware attack that hit the school system\u2019s computers in November 2020.\nThat attack led to a \u201ccatastrophic compromise of all BCPS functions and operations,\u201d Herndon said.\nThat data breach happened when a district employee opened an email attachment that was really a phishing attack. Recovering from that data breach cost the district more than $10 million, district officials said.\nAs for the data that was lost, \u201cinstead of creating thousands of individual vendors, a generic \u2018unknown vendor\u2019 was used to restore the accounting,\u201d Herndon said.\nWhile many districts didn\u2019t report any 2018 school spending data because the law didn\u2019t require them to do so, Baltimore County has been reporting that data since 2011, which is why the Local News Network was able to find that 2018 expenditure.\nIn Prince George\u2019s County, the public school district spent $87,596.83 at Three Brothers Italian Restaurants between fiscal years 2019 and 2022. To be more specific, the district spent $55,321.53 at Three Brothers in Greenbelt during the 2018-2019 school year and another $32,275.30 at the restaurant\u2019s Hyattsville location in the 2021-2022 school year.\nThe district appears to have a longstanding relationship with Three Brothers. While most school districts in the state didn\u2019t start reporting their vendor expenses to the state until 2019, Prince George\u2019s County has been doing so since 2012. Those older figures show the school district spent $82,505.60 at Three Brothers in 2017 and 2018.\nAsked for an explanation, Raven Hill, the district\u2019s associate superintendent for communications and community engagement, indicated Three Brothers is a go-to caterer for school events.\n\u201cThe catering expenses were spent across many schools, generally for student celebrations and staff/family meetings,\u201d Hill said. \u201cFor context, schools often provide food at parent meetings to encourage attendance. Meals were also provided to students at several community schools (low-income population, wraparound services) as incentives.\u201d\nIn Calvert County, school district officials haven\u2019t been just buying school supplies, textbooks and computers. They\u2019ve been buying wristwatches, too.\nThe district spent over $25,000 at JW Jewelers, a locally owned jewelry store in Prince Frederick, in 2021.\nThe expenditure was for 118 watches gifted to retiring employees, costing roughly $218 apiece, according to the district\u2019s chief financial officer, Scott Johnson.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based on reporting by CNS reporters Sarah Meklir, Christine Folivi and Zachary Intrater. After publication of this story, the Local News Network received a response from Anne Arundel County Schools to a request made under the Maryland Public Information Act, in which LNN asked for a list of all payments made under \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program.\u201d The response to the request shows that all those payments went to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Other counties made similar payments of employee tax collections, but LNN deleted all intergovernmental transfers from the project database so that the data would focus more clearly on payments to private vendors.",

    "summary": "Tom Ackerman, inspired by taking his challenging class outdoors, became a proponent for outdoor education, joining a coalition supporting the No Child Left Inside Act, which aims to provide federal funding for environmental education. Outdoor education has been shown to positively impact students' educational, physical, and emotional development.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When Tom Ackerman first began his teaching career in Harford County, the end of the school day always brought about frustration.\nDuring the final minutes of the class, he would attempt to wrangle his most challenging students\u2019 attention and connect them with his lessons.\nBut one day, Ackerman\u2019s principal \u2013 a former gym teacher \u2013 gave the science teacher a piece of advice that changed everything: take the students outside.\nAckerman started teaching his most difficult class outside on Friday afternoons. Each week, students would return to the classroom and excitedly share what they discovered. Before long, all of his classes wanted the same experience.\u00a0\n\u201cThey were just into it,\u201d said Ackerman, who is now the Chesapeake Bay Foundation\u2019s vice president for education.\u00a0\nThat moment was one of many that spurred Ackerman to join a nationwide coalition to improve access to outdoor education opportunities for K-12 students.\u00a0\nFor more than a decade, educators, environmentalists and dozens of policymakers have struggled to spur congressional action on Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes\u2019s No Child Left Inside Act, which would allocate federal funding to environmental education initiatives.\nLast month, the bill\u2019s sponsors reintroduced the No Child Left Inside Act in Congress more than a decade after it was first proposed. The coalition\u2019s reiterated push for action on the measure comes as climate change education and pandemic learning loss conversations have become increasingly present in American politics.\nIf passed, the No Child Left Inside Act would provide states with federal grants to develop partnerships between schools and organizations to foster real-world environmental and scientific experiences.\u00a0\nOutdoor education programs have been proven to have a positive effect on the educational, physical and emotional development of young people, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\u00a0\nOne 2018 study published in Frontiers in Psychology compared outcomes from identical lessons taught inside and outside and concluded that teachers were able to teach for almost twice as long without having to interrupt instruction to redirect students after outdoor lessons.\nThe No Child Left Inside Act has been reintroduced multiple times in Congress since first stalling in 2007. Even in years where the bill has passed out of the House, it has consistently faced challenges in the opposite chamber.\u00a0\nDespite the initiative\u2019s bumpy history, Sarbanes said its timely passage is crucial to help future generations prepare for and combat the looming effects of climate change.\u00a0\n\u201cOur young people are going to be the stewards of the planet and they\u2019re the leading edge of what we do to preserve our planet and combat climate change,\u201d Sarbanes told Capital News Service. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way of getting them ready for that responsibility than making sure that they have strong environmental education opportunities.\u201d\nAdvocates also believe the bill\u2019s subject matter revolves around a top priority for parents, students and educators across the country as they emerge from distance learning and attempt to make up for massive pandemic learning loss.\nThe 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress showed an average four-point drop in learning nationally compared with 2019 \u2013 equating to roughly two decades of educational progress.\n\u201cYou would think that learning outdoors would have been the solution to living through a pandemic, but there were all kinds of reasons why that didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Jackie Ostfeld who directs the Sierra Club\u2019s Outdoors For All campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s no quicker way to make up for learning loss and to grow test scores and to get your kids outdoors.\u201d\nThe pandemic \u201cshined a light\u201d on how important engaged, in-person learning experiences are for students, Ostfeld said. Mitigating the pandemic\u2019s impact on American education has also coincided with the bill having its strongest coalition ever this year, Ostfeld added.\nThe coalition has made progress in recent years by aligning the bill\u2019s goals with other federal education initiatives. The 2015 Every Students Succeed Act included a provision from the No Child Left Inside Act that helped states integrate environmental learning into their regular curriculum.\nBut the No Child Left Inside Act is still a \u201clong game\u201d initiative, Ostfeld said.\u00a0\nDespite its slow progress, the bill\u2019s consistent presence in Congress has already prompted dozens of states to develop environmental literacy plans in anticipation of its passage. Maryland was the first state in the nation to implement this plan, as the state requires an environmental literacy graduation requirement for all high schoolers.\nBills that are proactive and work to guide slow but steady progress take longer to pass than those brought on by a glaring national issue, Ostfeld said. Even if 2023 is not the year for federal action, millions of students in states that have started to incorporate outdoor education curriculum will continue to benefit from advocacy related to it.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not reacting to some horrible thing in the world. We are being proactive and saying, \u2018This is what the future needs to look like,\u2019\u201d Ostfeld said. \u201cThis bill helped to spark a movement, but now the movement is out there and the movement is strong. Every time the movement gets stronger and stronger and stronger, decision makers in Washington will hear about it.\u201d",

    "summary": "PointsBet ended its marketing deal with the University of Maryland, joining Michigan State and Colorado in terminating sports betting partnerships amid growing controversies. The terms and details of these agreements have largely been kept secret through third-party contracts, complicating transparency efforts.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2013 PointsBet sports book terminated its marketing deal with the University of Maryland in late April, according to published reports, and all parties are silent on the fallout from the end of the contract.\nThe partnership allowed PointsBet to advertise on UMD\u2019s campus, in its arenas, and across sports radio broadcast airwaves. A series of contracts allowed the public university to keep secret the terms of the deal. The move means that at least three top schools \u2013 Michigan State, Maryland and Colorado \u2013 with betting marketing contracts have now ended those agreements as problems and criticism of them mount. Another agreement with LSU is uncertain after Caesar\u2019s signage was removed there.\nThe University of Maryland College Park signed an agreement originating in December 2021 with the sports marketing firm PlayFly Sports, which then created a company just to deal with UMCP marketing deals called Maryland Sports Properties. It is PlayFly\u2019s Maryland Sports Properties that contracted with PointsBet to be the official gaming sponsor of Maryland Athletics.\n[ Read more in our series, Gambling On Campus ]\nUniversity President Darryll Pines\u2019 office, as well as Athletics administrators Damon Evans and Jason Yellin, declined to respond to Capital News Service emails seeking information about the contract. Only Brian Ullman, Maryland\u2019s vice president of Marketing and Communications responded, referring all inquiries from CNS to PointsBet, which did not respond to repeated requests for information and clarification.\nThe Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, both at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, reported in February that some universities shield their sports betting agreements by working with third-party marketing companies. The Povich and Howard centers discovered a close relationship between the University of Maryland and Maryland Sports Properties. Some MSP officials had university-issued email accounts and an office at Xfinity Center, the athletic venue where many UMD sports teams play and some coaches and administrators have offices.\u00a0\nLegal Sports Report, an online site, reported the Maryland deal was off on Tuesday, and other online sites, including Sports Handle, have reported the termination. Darren Rovell, a reporter with Action HQ, first reported the Maryland deal was off in a tweet on April 27.\n\u201cPointsBet and Playfly Sports have reached a mutual agreement to end their sponsorship at the University of Maryland,\u201d the company said in a statement to Legal Sports Report. Other published reports have indicated that PointsBet\u2019s U.S. business is up for sale.\nNews of the end of the Maryland deal comes as SB 620, a bill requiring universities to fully disclose all terms of partnerships with sports gaming entities and banning commission-based profit by schools, awaits the signature of Gov. Wes Moore.\u00a0\nThis bill was also designed to enhance transparency around gaming contracts by disallowing contracts via third parties and saying that all such contracts are, \u201csubject to public inspection in accordance with the Maryland Public Information Act.\u201d When this legislation was passed, Maryland\u2019s contract with PointsBet through PlayFly Sports, was already in effect and not subject to the bill.\n\u201cWhat this (contract ending) shows is that the University of Maryland is acknowledging they made a serious mistake in partnering with a predatory gambling operator,\u201d said Les Bernal of Stop Predatory Gambling. \u201cFor the sake of greed, at the expense of its own students. They placed greed over the best interests of students and they finally moved away from that.\u201d\nThe contract termination comes amid controversy in the college sports betting arena. In late March, the University of Colorado terminated a similar contract with PointsBet.\nThe University of Alabama fired head baseball coach Brad Bohannon for directly interacting with a bettor in Ohio who bet against the Crimson Tide. Similarly, Iowa athletics is investigating 26 student-athletes from varying sports teams regarding possible sports betting violations. Specifically, the Iowa gaming commission is investigating the Hawkeyes baseball team.\nThe end of the deal leaves a lot up in the air: Will the collapse of both the Maryland and Colorado deal deter other universities from entering such contracts? Will Maryland pursue another partnership with a sports gaming entity? What was the motivation for ending the PointsBet/Maryland deal and how will both entities now move forward?\nRebecca Snyder, executive director of the MDDC Press Association, provided possible reasons for PointsBet backing out of the deal while acknowledging the potential for Maryland to pursue another contract.\n\u201cIt could mean (PointsBet is), like, full-scale eliminating all their contracts with schools. Maybe that says either it\u2019s not profitable enough for them or it\u2019s too complicated or maybe \u2026 there\u2019s too much scrutiny and it\u2019s not worth their ability to do it,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything went off the table. Whatever agreement they come to, they\u2019ll need to know that it\u2019ll have more transparency in that process, more scrutiny and of course more discussion. It seems like a really lucrative business so I can\u2019t imagine that somebody won\u2019t try to jump in at some point to create another agreement.\u201d\nBernal agreed that sports gaming entities will not be shy in continuing to pursue such deals because sports betting is profitable. That means it\u2019s the responsibility of universities to protect students by avoiding these partnerships, he said. Public pressure also likely increases universities\u2019 reluctance.\u00a0\n\u201cThe University of Maryland did not do this out of their own good will. I think they did it because they were facing, you know, growing, intense public scrutiny and good media reporting,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cI think PointsBet wants these deals, badly. I think universities are facing intense, intense scrutiny not to do these deals. I think PointsBet would do a deal with every university in this country if they could.\u201d\nAs sports betting continues to be legalized across the country, the issue of how schools balance joining such contracts with protecting students is going to become more imperative, experts say.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had three schools that have announced that they had disciplinary measures because of student athletes betting or coaches betting. It\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Tom McMillen, former U.S. congressman and president and chief executive officer of Lead1, which represents athletics directors at 131 member universities of the Football Bowl Subdivision. McMillen is uniquely qualified to discuss the issue because he is a former University of Maryland All-American basketball player and Olympian, who went on to play 11 years in the NBA with the Buffalo Braves, New York Knicks, Atlanta Hawks and Washington Bullets.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think sports betting is going to go away in the United States,\u201d McMillen said, \u201cBut I think there are some very necessary steps that have to be taken before anyone engages in those areas, because it\u2019s just, it\u2019s highly risky.\u201d\nMcMillen specifically referenced the need for universities to have safe spaces to help students with gambling addictions, debts, and any other potential consequence of sports gambling, if they decide to pursue such contracts.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have to make it a part of your whole medical center, and you have to talk about the problems of gambling,\u201d McMillen said. \u201cEvery school needs to take precautionary steps to make sure that this doesn\u2019t blow up in their face.\u201d\n[ Read more in our series, Gambling On Campus ]\nIf a new contract were to be signed in Maryland moving forward, its details should be easily accessible to the public and state legislature, unlike UMD\u2019s previous contracts, under the legislation pending before Moore. While Snyder acknowledged the importance of transparency, Bernal said universities should not participate in these deals in any capacity.\u00a0\n\u201cOn the bright side, I feel like now, especially with the legislation that was passed, this last session, whatever contracts or agreements come in place subsequent to this contract termination will have to be more public, which I think is definitely a good thing,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWhen public dollars are involved, and certainly the University of Maryland gets all or most of its funding through the state, I think more transparency is required. They have a duty to the public and to the state to show how they\u2019re spending their money as well as how they\u2019re transacting to monetize their student body essentially.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the public interest for a public university to be partnering with any of these predatory dealing operators and this is just one baby step towards making a huge difference on this issue,\u201d said Bernal. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any deals with any gaming operators, regardless of the transparency or not, because it\u2019s a dangerous and addictive product for college students.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 One of the biggest changes to state education policy to come out of the Maryland General Assembly this session didn\u2019t actually originate from lawmakers \u2013 it came from the new attitude in the governor\u2019s office.\nGov. Wes Moore emphasized access to a good education for all in Maryland, and demonstrated he isn\u2019t afraid to spend money on ensuring that.\nWhen the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future school reform plan passed in 2021 by the Maryland General Assembly, it came on an override of former Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of the bill. In contrast, Gov. Wes Moore allocated an extra $500 million on top of the required amount for funding the Blueprint and shifted some transportation funding into education, for a total of $900 million excess dollars.\n\u201cTo have a governor that not only is willing to talk with you, but collaborate and work in partnership on ideas is refreshing,\u201d said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association. \u201dIt really speaks to his character and his priority for education and eliminating childhood poverty, because a lot of that is tied to education.\u201d\nMoore continued to demonstrate his dedication to improving education in Maryland through the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act of 2023, one of his 10 proposed pieces of legislation for the 2023 General Assembly session that ended April 10.\n\u201cThe pandemic dealt a serious blow to our education workforce. Teachers are tired, strained, and overworked \u2013 and they need reinforcements, here and now. That is why I am calling on the General Assembly to pass the Maryland Educator Shortage Act \u2013 to strengthen the pipeline of qualified teachers in our state,\u201d said Moore in his state of the state address at the beginning of February.\nThe bill, which currently sits on the governor\u2019s desk, seeks to establish specific recruitment and retention goals for teachers in the state.\n\u201cWe are really happy that it\u2019s another tool that can be used during this historic educator shortage time that we\u2019re in,\u201d Bost told Capital News Service.\nMore tools are needed, though, to fully staff schools, including a Grow-Your-Own program, cut from the bill, which aims to recruit educators who will teach in their own communities and help those who are aiming to be teachers in different areas like offering scholarships or helping create partnerships with schools, she said.\nBut teacher shortages are not the only shortages faced in education, both in Maryland and nationwide.\n\u201cWe have lots of vacancies, as parents know, with bus drivers or paraeducators that work with students or cafeteria workers and just as we have historic vacancies in teachers and administrators, we also have vacancies in these positions that we have to address,\u201d Bost said.\nIn the future, she hopes to see a work group created to study why these vacancies exist, how they can retain workers, and consider appropriate wages.\nAnother bill Bost was excited to see pass this session was one that would require teachers to receive training for virtual education, and provide the option for counties to have virtual school days in cases of extreme weather.\n\u201cWe know that post-pandemic we\u2019re still going to have some virtual schools or at least virtual programs, and we wanted to make sure that they were top notch,\u201d she said. Baltimore City and Baltimore Democrat Sen. Mary Washington\u2019s bill, she said, puts \u201cin some really good guardrails\u201d to bring parity to virtual schools with physical schools.\nIt was down to the wire before the deadline for adjournment when the Senate took up discussion on the bill, but it finally passed with a majority just minutes before the session came to a close at midnight.\nIn addition to bills that directly pertain to education, many proposals from this session will have a far-reaching impact into many aspects of life, including education.\nThe Maryland Education Coalition was tracking a bill from Del. Stephanie Smith, D-Baltimore City, that would establish a neighborhood tier system to determine the number of students eligible for reduced or free lunch at school.\n\u201cWe think that the neighborhood tiers is probably the most accurate way to count poverty and we want to move towards that, but I don\u2019t think the legislature was quite ready, and I think it\u2019s a very complicated formula, honestly, to look at, so that\u2019s something I think will come back next year,\u201d said Ellie Mitchell, co-chair of MEC. \u201cThat may end up increasing the overall cost of the Blueprint, when we have students counted the way they should be.\u201d\nIn addition to pushing for future passage of that bill, MEC also wants to focus on what Ricky Tyler, who co-chairs with Mitchell, calls \u201cstudent services,\u201d aka their social, emotional, mental and behavioral health, as well as juvenile service issues.\n\u201cWe need to look at (these issues) because that is part of ensuring that the kids come ready to school, ready to learn,\u201d he said.\nOddly, of the almost 100 bills the governor signed the day after adjournment, just one was related to education: the use of alcoholic beverages for educational purposes. SB672, which was cross-filed with HB987, allows students 18 and up to taste certain alcoholic beverages as a part of an educational class.\nOther education-related bills awaiting his signature now are an update to the Maryland State School Health Services guidelines regarding anaphylactic food allergies and for local school boards to disclose foods served in the schools as well as the major allergens they contain; and one that requires public schools to disclose information to students, staff and parents about Title IX coordinators and the processes and supports in place for those who file sexual misconduct complaints.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Growing up as the oldest child in a single-parent home, Brittani Williams longed to leave her Baton Rouge, Louisiana, home for better opportunities and challenged herself to be a role model for her siblings.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was my charge given to me by me to get a college degree so that I could show my siblings that they could do the same,\u201d said Williams, who is now a senior policy analyst in higher education for The Education Trust, an advocacy organization that promotes educational equity.\nAlthough going to college changed her life, the financial impact was stressful.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a student loan borrower. I didn\u2019t want to be, but because of the circumstances, the lack of wealth in my family, I had to be a borrower,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat was my choice, my option, because (not) getting a college degree was not an option for me.\u201d\u00a0\nHer experience is far from isolated: 45 million Americans have federal student loan debt totaling $1.6 trillion, according to the White House.\u00a0\nAnd research and polling has shown that student debt is linked to increased anxiety and depression. An upcoming Supreme Court decision on student debt relief could only add to the stress.\nTo address the rising amount of higher education debt, President Joe Biden introduced a student loan relief plan in August 2022 that would forgive up to $10,000 in debt per individual and $20,000 for those who received a Pell Grant.\u00a0\nBut now, two legal challenges to the plan have reached the Supreme Court, which could shut down the forgiveness plan.\u00a0\n\u201c\u200b\u200bPeople take out student loans with huge hopes and dreams. It\u2019s supposed to get them through this degree that\u2019s going to launch them into a career and help them achieve the American dream,\u201d said Sabrina Cereceres, special project manager at the Student Debt Crisis Center, an organization that helps student loan borrowers navigate repayment options.\u00a0\n\u201c(But) when it comes to time to repay their loans, they\u2019re making payments, they\u2019re trying to navigate this repayment system, and then, you know, a lot of these borrowers just see their account balances go up and up,\u201d Cereceres said.\u00a0\nBorrowers are now anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling decisions on whether the federal loan forgiveness plan is valid.\u00a0\nThe legal challenges come in the midst of an existing mental health crisis.\nA majority of Americans \u2013 54% \u2013 has reported experiencing mental health issues related to student debt, according to a September poll by ELVTR, a virtual learning platform.\nThe survey of 2,000 people between 18 and 67 with some college experience revealed that 56% said they suffered anxiety due to their student debt; 32% reported depression, 20% insomnia and 17% panic attacks.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe mental toll of student debt especially affects Black borrowers and students who come from low-wealth backgrounds, who are already disproportionately undertreated for mental health.\u00a0\nIn many studies and research papers that have investigated this phenomenon, two major solutions to the stress of student loans are getting assistance from parental wealth and securing high-paying jobs.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments on Feb. 28 in two legal cases challenging the constitutionality of Biden\u2019s plan. Protesters and leaders from advocacy groups clustered around the court with colorful signs and loudspeakers, chanting in the direction of the justices inside to allow the relief plan to go through.\u00a0\nThe uncertainty of policy surrounding college affordability and whether loans will be forgiven may even add to existing anxiety for borrowers, according to Erica White, a research scholar at the Center for Public Health Law and Policy.\u00a0\nMany borrowers don\u2019t even know when they\u2019ll have to start payments again as the Biden administration has continued to push a COVID-19 emergency loan payment pause into 2023. Waiting , and waiting for a high court decision adds to that unpredictability, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re just feeling very jaded with the Supreme Court,\u201d White said. \u201cI would imagine that just adds to the lack of trust and the stress that everyone is experiencing right now.\u201d\nStudent debt is a public health concern, according to White.\u00a0\n\u201cThis court is just really not motivated by public health data,\u201d White said.\u00a0\nEven if the conservative majority on the Supreme Court invalidates Biden\u2019s plan, Williams said that she and other advocates will continue to explore other alternatives to make college more affordable.\u00a0\n\u201cWe, as in stakeholders in higher education reform, we should not count it as a loss because there is more work to be done,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think that my message would be, you know, to be hopeful.\u201d",

    "summary": "Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. David Trone, both Maryland Democrats, have proposed legislation aimed at addressing educational inequities and eliminating academic achievement gaps.\nThe TRUE EQUITY Act, whose full title is \u200b\u200bTransformational Reforms and Updates to Ensure Educational Quality and Urgent Investments in Today\u2019s Youth Act of 2023, would provide $1.4 billion in federal grants for states and local communities that prioritize education policy changes and address education inequities in traditionally underserved areas.\n\u201cMaryland students deserve the very best public education, and we are united in this fight for the federal government to be a strong partner in the positive transformation of our schools,\u201d Cardin and Trone said in a statement last month. \u201cThe TRUE EQUITY Act establishes a stronger federal partnership with state and local communities dedicated to providing their children a world-class education.\u201d\nThe legislation parallels policy recommendations of the Maryland Commission on Innovation & Excellence in Education\u2019s Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future. Passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint will make major changes to the Maryland public education system over a decade with annual education funding increases of $3.8 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror image in some ways, in terms of the priorities in the federal legislation,\u201d Ellie Mitchell, co-chair of the Maryland Education Coalition, told Capital News Service. \u201cI think it\u2019s designed really to think about trying to take a little bit of the load off of the state burden that is created by the Kirwan Commission in the Blueprint\u2026 So I\u2019m sure the intent is to find a way to do some federal offset to this huge influx of state funding that is happening.\u201d\nThe implementation costs of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future Act would be partially covered by federal grants provided through the TRUE EQUITY Act.\nDuring March, initial implementation plans of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future were due from local school districts, the Maryland State Department of Education and other agencies involved with implementing the Blueprint. Based on the legislation\u2019s implementation timeline, by July 2026 the minimum teacher salary in every Maryland school district will be $60,000.\nWhile his legislation is based on Maryland\u2019s education reform plan, \u201cany state or local jurisdiction can apply for funding as long as they are open to strengthening intergovernmental partnerships that will further student achievement, eliminate disparities and provide a world-class public education to all students,\u201d Cardin said in a statement to CNS.\nThe COVID pandemic played a large role in furthering education disparities, especially for minority and low-income students, according to Cardin and Trone.\nIn an effort to reverse these effects and improve public school systems, the legislation would focus on five main areas.\nThese areas would include new grants to invest in early childhood education, funding additional teacher training, giving all students access to career and college pathways by 10th grade and funding programs that aim to reduce achievement gaps. The legislation would also require states applying for funding to form state oversight boards, which would hold state and local school districts accountable if they did not meet state educational equity goals.\n\u201cWe now know that COVID-19 exacerbated existing disparities and achievement gaps, so the additional support is all the more essential,\u201d Cardin said.\n\u201cThe teacher crisis is not a pandemic-created situation,\u201d Mitchell agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been hurtling towards for a long time, in terms of teacher shortages, and also in terms of not having the diverse workforce that we want within education.\u201d\nThe Maryland Education Coalition\u2019s mission is primarily to ensure sufficient funding and equitable policies with transparent accountability in public education, based on the Maryland Constitution, which requires a \u201cthorough and efficient set of free public schools,\u201d said co-chair Rick Tyler Jr.\nTyler said he hopes that the Maryland congressional delegation will be able to win support from colleagues from other states.\n\u201cI will also say that Maryland historically has been a leader in education reform nationally. My initial understanding I have is that many other states are looking at what Maryland is doing,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cThat may be another way where they will join in and support this legislation.\u201d\nThe measure also drew praise from Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association.\n\u201cThe TRUE EQUITY Act will provide a true federal partnership with our state and local efforts to eliminate academic disparities across racial and socioeconomic lines and elevate the teaching profession,\u201d Bost said in a statement.\nMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin and Glenn Ivey also back the legislation.",

    "summary": "Howard County and Anne Arundel County in Maryland have recently implemented later school start times, aligning with growing national efforts to address adolescent sleep deprivation, which is linked to improved academic performance and mental health. Teenagers' natural circadian rhythms make it difficult for them to get enough sleep when schools start early, according to experts.",
    "content": "When the Howard County Board of Education voted last month to start the school day later, it became the second Maryland jurisdiction in just two years to push its school start times back.\nThe movement for later school start times has been gaining momentum for decades. Those efforts have come to fruition as Howard County passed a resolution to push its high school start time to 8 a.m. in the same academic year that Anne Arundel County implemented its 8:30 a.m. high school start times.\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools announced that it was shifting to \u201chealthier school start and dismissal times for students.\u201d\nStudies show that sleep deprivation in adolescents is a known risk factor for increased drug use, depression and suicide. Academic performance as well as students\u2019 physical and mental health improve when students are able to get more sleep, according to research done by the University of Minnesota.\nLater school start times have also been shown to reduce student\u2019s sleepiness and school tardiness per a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\u201cWhat good are all the amazing classes offered in [Howard County Public School System] high schools if students are asleep in class? Or if the students can\u2019t retain the information they are taught because they don\u2019t get enough REM sleep?\u201d Marriotts Ridge High School student Audrey Grutzik said at a Howard County school board meeting in January.\nTeenagers experience a shift in their circadian clocks, also known as a biological or internal rhythm, after puberty. They get tired later at night and wake up later in the morning, and early school start times force high school students to ignore those biological needs.\n\u201cIf school starts too early, adolescents are \u2026 being asked to function at a time that is misaligned with their biological clock,\u201d said Dr. Amy Wolfson, who is on the board of directors of the Sleep Research Society and a professor at Loyola University in Maryland.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that high-school aged students need eight to 10 hours of sleep a day.\nBut the most recent Maryland Department of Health youth risk survey in the 2018-19 school year found that only about 22% of Maryland high school students surveyed actually get the recommended eight hour minimum of sleep, with a majority of respondents saying they get six hours or less of nightly rest.\n\nIn the 2022-23 school year, 17 of Maryland\u2019s 24 jurisdictions\u2019 average high school start times are before 8 a.m. Howard will be just the eighth jurisdiction in the state whose high schools\u2019 average start time is at 8 a.m. or later when its resolution takes effect, joining Anne Arundel, Dorchester, Garrett, Prince George\u2019s, St. Mary\u2019s, Washington and Worcester counties.\n\nWith Anne Arundel and Howard counties shifting to later start times, they are still among the few Maryland school districts that fall in line with recommendations from the state health department and American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThe Maryland General Assembly passed the Orange Ribbon for Healthy School Hours certification in 2016, which was sponsored by then-delegate and now-lieutenant governor Aruna Miller. It recognizes local school systems with start times at or after 8 a.m \u2014 in line with the Maryland Department of Health and American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 recommendations.\nHoward and Anne Arundel counties both moved virtual school start times back during the COVID-19 pandemic to 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m., respectively. Lisa VanBuskirk, the leader of the Anne Arundel County and Maryland chapters of Start School Later, said that the later school start times resonated with parents and students.\nStart School Later is an organization that advocates for later school start times that are \u201ccompatible with health, safety, education, and equity.\u201d\n\"I think districts realized, \u2018Oh, my goodness, if we can start later virtually why can't we start later in reality?\u2019 and students and families [were] saying the same things,\u201d Wolfson said.\nThere are certain obstacles with the potential costs of updating transportation systems for different school start times should resolutions be passed. VanBuskirk said it can be harder for districts with smaller budgets to imagine footing potential costs when considering pushing school start times back.\nHowever, Wolfson said any smaller interventions or countermeasures to limit the downsides of sleep deprivation in students don\u2019t compare to the benefits of delaying school start times.\n\u201cSlowly but surely there is more cross-talk between the science world \u2026 and educators,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cThere is definitely more movement and more recognition now than even five or six years ago.\u201d",

    "summary": "Big Ten universities have seen significant increases in out-of-state tuition, outpacing inflation by nearly $12,000 on average from 2003 to 2021, while in-state tuition has remained relatively stagnant. Northwestern University, a private institution, leads with the highest tuition and fees, significantly outpacing inflation.",
    "content": "Big Ten universities tend to increase tuition and fees annually, but it can be hard to tell how much more expensive these schools are actually getting. Capital News Service\u2019s analysis of Big Ten tuition data from 2003-2021 shows that tuition is outpacing inflation, but differences between universities vary considerably. \nThe 14 universities in the Big Ten span from the mid-Atlantic coastal region to the Midwest. University of Maryland, Rutgers University, Pennsylvania State University, Ohio State University, Indiana University, Purdue University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, University of Illinois, Northwestern University, University of Iowa, University of Nebraska, University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota are all in the Big Ten.\nBig Ten out-of-state tuition is outpacing inflation, while in-state costs remain level\n\n\n\nTuition increases are common in the Big Ten but since 2003, out-of-state tuition has increased much more rapidly than in-state tuition.\nOn average, Big Ten in-state tuition costs have remained relatively stagnant for 20 years. Adjusted to 2021 dollars for inflation, the Big Ten average in-state tuition has increased by $1,500 from 2003 to 2021.\nOn the other hand, out-of-state tuition costs have increased significantly. Adjusted for inflation, the Big Ten average out-of-state tuition increased by nearly $12,000 from 2003 to 2021.\n\n\n\nIn both 2003 and 2021, the Big Ten average in-state tuition was equivalent to about 19% of the national median household income. \nAlternatively, in 2003, the Big Ten average out-of-state tuition equated to about 42% of the national median household income, while in 2021, it was up to about 53%.\nNorthwestern University\u2019s tuition is greatly outpacing inflation\n\n\n\nAs a private institution, Northwestern charges all students the same tuition with no distinction between in-state and out-of-state. \nNorthwestern\u2019s tuition and fees are consistently the highest in the Big Ten by a considerable margin compared to average in-state tuition rates and by a smaller margin compared to average out-of-state tuition rates. \nPrices adjusted to 2021 dollars show a nearly $20,000 increase in Northwestern\u2019s tuition from 2003 to 2021, $8,000 more than the Big Ten average out-of-state tuition increase and $18,000 more than the average in-state tuition increase. \nIn 2003, tuition at Northwestern was equivalent to about 66% of the national median household income. In 2021, tuition equaled 86% of the median household income, a 20% increase.\nNorthwestern promotes its financial aid and scholarship numbers as offsets to its tuition costs. The average scholarship for a first-year student is $57,000 and 61% of undergraduate students receive financial aid, according to the admissions office.\nIn a January 2023 financial update signed by Northwestern University President Michael Schill, Provost Kathleen Hagerty and Executive Vice President Craig Johnson, the university noted increases in the number of low-income students enrolled and the number of students who receive financial aid.\n\u201cOur investments in financial aid also have promoted equity and access. Over the past year, we exceeded our goal of drawing more than 20% of our undergraduates from Pell-eligible lower-income families,\u201d the statement said.\nPurdue University\u2019s frozen tuition makes it an affordable option\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Purdue\u2019s tuition increases followed the Big Ten average and began to outpace inflation.\nFalling median household incomes during the Great Recession decreased the margin between tuition and income, making Purdue more expensive.\nTo combat this, the university implemented a frozen tuition policy in 2013 to keep tuition and fees at the 2012 level, locking in tuition and fees at around $10,000 for in-state students and $29,000 for out-of-state students.\n\u201cIn this period of national economic stagnation, it\u2019s time for us to hit the pause button on tuition increases,\u201d then-Purdue University President Mitch Daniels said when he announced the policy in 2013. \u201cOur students and their families deserve a high-value education that they can afford. We will fit our spending to their budgets \u2014 not the other way around.\u201d\nWhen adjusted to 2021 dollars, the cost of tuition and fees in 2021 nearly returned to the 2003 level because of the frozen tuition policy, making Purdue one of the most affordable universities in the Big Ten.\nIn February 2023, the Purdue University Board of Trustees renewed the tuition freeze for the 12th consecutive year, keeping tuition and fees for Purdue students at the 2012 level through the 2024-2025 academic year.\nUniversity of Nebraska is consistently one of the most affordable Big Ten schools\n\n\n\nWhile Nebraska\u2019s yearly costs are some of the lowest in the Big Ten, both in-state and out-of-state tuition are slightly outpacing inflation each year. \nAdjusted to 2021 dollars, in-state tuition increased by about $3,500 and out-of-state tuition increased by more than $11,000 from 2003 to 2021. That\u2019s $2,000 more than the Big Ten average in-state increase but about the same as the average out-of-state increase.\nEven with increasing prices that are outpacing inflation, Nebraska\u2019s tuition costs are well below average in the Big Ten. \nIn 2003, in-state tuition was about half of the Big Ten average at around $4,000 and out-of-state tuition was more than $7,000 less than the average. Nebraska\u2019s low tuition continued through 2021, when in-state tuition was nearly $4,000 less than the Big Ten average and out-of-state tuition was more than $11,000 less.\nOn March 3, University of Nebraska President Ted Carter testified to the Nebraska Legislature Appropriations Committee on the university\u2019s budget request for the upcoming academic years.\nCarter acknowledged financial challenges facing the university, including 40-year-high inflation, employment costs, upkeep expenses and declining enrollment, but vowed to overcome these obstacles.\n\u201cWe intend to remain on solid financial footing, even with new challenges ahead,\u201d Carter testified. \u201cWe are going to have the tough conversations necessary so we don\u2019t become one of those universities [predicted to] operate in the red.\u201d\nCarter also expressed continued commitment to affordability for students at the university.\n\u201cWe will not balance our budget on the backs of students \u2026 accessibility for Nebraskans is a fundamental part of our mission and a key factor in students\u2019 decision to enroll,\u201d Carter said.\nUniversity of Maryland follows the Big Ten trend\n\n\n\nAt Maryland, in-state tuition levels increased slightly since 2003, but out-of-state tuition has outpaced inflation considerably.\nAdjusted to 2021 dollars, Maryland\u2019s in-state tuition increased by about $2,000 between 2003 and 2021, about $500 more than the Big Ten average. Its out-of-state tuition increased by more than $15,000 during this period, nearly $3,000 more than the Big Ten average increase.\nIn January 2023, Maryland implemented the Terrapin Commitment, a need-based financial aid program to help offset the costs of tuition. However, only in-state students are eligible for the program.\n\u201cEvery Maryland student deserves an equal opportunity to attend the state\u2019s flagship university, and the Terrapin Commitment grant is one more measure we are taking to ensure that a University of Maryland education is affordable to all residents of our state,\u201d University of Maryland President Darryll Pines said in a statement.\nFor out-of-state students \u2014 who have seen much higher tuition increases than in-state students \u2014 there is not a program similar to the Terrapin Commitment. \n\nMethodology:\nBig Ten university tuition data was compiled from the Common Data Set, a report that includes important figures on universities\u2019 tuition, attendance and admission rates, and from universities\u2019 historical tuition data. The annual Common Data Set includes tuition estimates for the following academic year, meaning final tuition and fees for each academic year can be slightly different from the estimates published in the Common Data Set. A list of sources used in this report can be found here.\nNational median household income data was accessed from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nFigures collected from the Common Data Set and Census Bureau were adjusted to 2021 dollars using the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator.",

    "summary": "Maryland Delegate Karen Toles has introduced HB1105, proposing an elective water safety and swimming course for public school students in grades 8-12 to address high drowning rates among minority children. The bill aims to offer the course as a physical education credit and potentially open opportunities for lifeguarding jobs and college recruitment in competitive swimming.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Of the many bills in this year\u2019s legislative session set to make changes to education in Maryland, one stands out: a bill that would develop a water safety and swimming curriculum for high school-aged students.\nDel. Karen Toles, D-Prince George\u2019s, is the main sponsor of HB1105, which would require the State Board of Education to establish an elective course for public school students in grades 8-12 that would teach them the basics of swimming and water safety.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is a huge issue, particularly in the Black community, that more minority kids drown from not knowing how to swim than any other group of individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that we should look at, which gave me the idea to put something like this forward.\u201d\nToles also noted that many Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Howard and Hampton made sure kids knew how to swim before they could graduate, which is something she took into consideration when coming up with the bill.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional death for children ages 17 and below. In children aged 10-14, Black children drown at 7.6 times the rate that white children do in swimming pools.\nThe bill suggests public middle or high schools offering this course partner with a local parks and recreation agency to connect them with the pool and facilities needed in order to successfully teach it.\n\u201cI drafted the bill to say that you can use (it) as a physical education credit, and having it during middle school and high school, they actually get credit for physical education,\u201d said Toles. The idea has the added benefit of possible lifeguarding jobs down the road for students successfully completing the course.\u00a0\nThe delegate also said she would like to see more competitive swimming programs lead to recruitments to colleges and universities. Having a program that teaches teenagers swimming and water safety skills increases the opportunities for them to be a part of a competitive swim team.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is important to our community that has been underrepresented and has been underserved for far too long in order to be able to bring quality swimming opportunities to our communities in Maryland, as well as to continue to promote water safety and drowning prevention,\u201d said Nicholas Askew, head coach and director of Swimming and Diving at Howard University, in testimony on the bill before the House Ways and Means Committee March 8.\nDr. William Ramos, member of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council, said that one unique thing about HB1105 is that it targets high-school-aged children, while typically this type of legislation is targeted at younger kids.\n\u201cWe start seeing teen boys drowning at higher rates around those grades, so it\u2019s an important and intervention piece,\u201d he said. \u201cOften I think we forget about the older kids, assuming they got something when they were younger, but many don\u2019t.\u201d\nIf the bill passes, local boards of education would have to implement the course beginning in the 2025-2026 school year.\n\u201cThis bill is a step, a huge step in being able to have a solution to this public health crisis,\u201d said Askew. \u201cMany of our communities are around waterways, many of our children will try to enjoy different areas around pools and splash parks, and it is our obligation as adults to be able to provide them with the safest opportunities as possible.\u201d\nSome Maryland public schools already offer some sort of water safety program to students. Charles County Public Schools, for example, has fifth graders watch a video from the Red Cross about water safety, discuss good conduct to have around bodies of water, and take a field trip to a nearby pool for a day of water activities.\u00a0\n\u201cLearning to swim and having those skills certainly has a buffering effect on drowning, but it also opens amazing opportunities for people to use the water right for recreation and leisure therapy,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cBut if we think of swim lessons as the only cure, by the time a child has to use their swim skills to rescue themselves or perhaps somebody else, they\u2019ve missed the smarts part, so we want to start by teaching people how to make sure they don\u2019t get into these situations.\u201d\nFifth graders in Anne Arundel County Public Schools participate in a Drownproofing Program, where they learn personal water safety skills as a part of the physical education and language arts curriculum.\u00a0\nToles told Capital News Service that her home county also offers a water safety program for its elementary schoolers.\u00a0\n\u201cWe do have that program where they\u2019re taking second graders out for a few days and teaching them how to swim after they\u2019ve had their water safety course,\u201d she said.\nThe American Red Cross has a whole page on its website dedicated to its water safety and aquatic resources, training, and information.\nMore and more jurisdictions are producing legislation concerning water safety, including some that put students in the pool, Ramos said.\nRamos also clarified the difference between just teaching kids to swim, versus teaching them water safety. Water safety is preventative \u2013 learning how to be smart around bodies of water so kids don\u2019t get into positions where they then have to rely on their swimming and water skills. But swimming skills are also necessary so that children can get to a safe place in the event of an emergency.\nThe bill has bipartisan support: One of the 23 sponsoring delegates is Republican Rachel Munoz, R-Anne Arundel.\u00a0\n\u201cWe definitely need to focus on equity and inclusion when it comes to kids learning how to swim,\u201d said Toles.",

    "summary": "Maryland Governor Wes Moore's proposed service year program for high school graduates draws inspiration from existing initiatives like the Service Year Alliance, aiming to foster civic engagement and personal growth. The plan, which includes the creation of a new department focused on civic and service innovation, seeks to connect young people with paid opportunities to contribute to their communities in various ways.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 While details of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s service year option for high school graduates are still being worked out, there are many other existing service year programs in the state, nationally and worldwide that allow people to gain the experience and give back to the community in the way Moore wants.\nThe governor has made service one of his top priorities this term, signing an executive order creating the Maryland Department of Civic and Service Innovation on his first full day in office. Moore\u2019s proposed plan for Maryland so far is a unique combination of the service year programs that have come before it.\nOne such program is Service Year Alliance, whose board chair, retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, joined Moore for his testimony in front of the Senate\u2019s Education, Energy and the Environment Committee on Feb. 22.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be here because Maryland is on the verge of doing something really special that I\u2019ve been involved with for more than a decade,\u201d McChrystal said. \u201cTo me, service is not just an opportunity to get certain tasks done in the state or in the nation\u2014we can hire people for that. We cannot hire people to be good citizens, we have to make them, we have to mold them, we\u2019ve got to give every young American that opportunity.\u201d\nThat molding of young citizens is the idea behind both Moore\u2019s Service Year and the Service Year Alliance program. The Alliance runs an online website that connects young people looking to serve their communities with paid opportunities to do so, according to Kristen Bennett, Alliance CEO. It serves a range of people, from high school graduates to GED recipients to college grads to those who are mid-career looking to gain experience. Participants can end up helping clean up from natural disasters, tutoring, rebuilding homes, helping with conservation projects, and many other opportunities.\nOn serviceyear.org, interested participants fill out a profile about themselves and their interests, as well as time periods and locations where they are available. Based on this information, the platform suggests matches for organizations and opportunities, and participants can then apply to what interests them.\n\u201cOne of the things that we are always trying to put front and center is that there\u2019s not one way to do a service year, there really are a lot of different opportunities,\u201d Bennett said..\nWhile Service Year Alliance does not directly host service participants, it partners with other groups like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps to link interested individuals with service opportunities. It was formed in 2016, and has over 225,000 users on the platform.\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, it\u2019s like applying for any other job; one of the reasons we created serviceyear.org is because the opportunities to serve are with thousands of organizations across the country, and there wasn\u2019t really one place to find all of them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was make it approachable.\u201d\nParticipating in a service year program also increases the likelihood of someone returning to school and earning a degree, the Alliance has found.\n\u201cWe have seen that those who participate in service year programs without a bachelor\u2019s degree are over twice as likely than their peers to go and earn a bachelor\u2019s degree (after their service year),\u201d said Bennett. An Alliance report from 2018 showed that 24% of service year alum who served without a bachelor\u2019s degree went on to earn one, as compared to just 11% of their peers who went on to achieve a bachelor\u2019s after two years of full-time work.\nAnother youth service organization is Youth Service America, a group that helps kids and young people ages 5-25 get involved in giving back to their communities. It was founded in 1986, and has engaged over 3.2 million young people in service in the last decade.\n\u201cOur biggest strategy is what we call the ask. We know that most young people volunteer for the first time because someone that they know asked them to,\u201d said Karen Daniel, vice president of programs at YSA. \u201cWe really work hard to make sure that all young people are invited to serve and we know that not all young people are asked to serve at the same rates.\u201d\nSimilar is the National Youth Leadership Council, whose goal since its founding in 1983, is to help young people become civically engaged and informed through serving learning, in the hopes of creating a more \u201cjust, sustainable and peaceful world.\u201d The group strengthens the sustainability of service learning opportunities in organizations and schools, as well as increases the quality of the service opportunities.\n\u201cThe benefit of quality service learning is that there are actual outcomes for the students as well as the community,\u201d said Amy Meuers, chief executive officer of NYLC. \u201cWe see increases in engagement, we see development of academic skills and investment in student success through service learning.\u201d\nOther national organizations dedicated to offering service opportunities are AmeriCorps, which has been around since 1993, the Peace Corps, founded in 1961, Teach for America, established in 1990, and the more recent Report for America, started in 2017, among others.\nWorldwide, there are organizations such as the Republic of the Philippines\u2019 National Youth Commission, and South Africa\u2019s National Youth Service Programme. Both aim to help combat issues affecting youth in their respective countries.\nNYC was created in 1995 with the mission of promoting sustainable programs and policies that benefit Filipino youth. One of the things it offers is a Government Internship Program, which started out as a summer work program for students, where unemployed and out-of-school youth are hired as interns and are paid a monthly stipend.\nNYDA, the parent of the National Youth Service Programme, was created by an act of South Africa\u2019s Parliament in 2008 for the purpose of addressing issues faced by the youth in the nation. It offers a variety of programs, such as entrepreneurship grants, business management training and a jobs program, which helps young people get connected with opportunities they have skills for.\nElements of all of these programs can be seen in Maryland\u2019s Serving Every Region Through Vocational Exploration Act of 2023, or HB546, which was introduced Feb. 2, on behalf of the Moore administration. The bill establishes and funds the Service Year Option, and has bipartisan support. Its Senate counterpart is SB551.\nUnder the act, participants would be placed in a service job for a minimum of 30 hours a week, paid $15 an hour by their employer, and receive mentorship and job training. According to the bill, the service job may be in the public or private sector, but no other specifics have been outlined.\nOther things that have yet to be established are what year the program would be available to potential participants, who will be leading the new department or what other positions need to be filled in the department.\nMoore testified at both the House hearing in the Appropriations Committee on Feb. 21, and the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee on Feb. 22.\n\u201cI believe deeply that all the challenges that our state and all the challenges that our nation are facing, that it is going to be service that is going to help to save us,\u201d Moore told the House committee in his testimony. \u201cFrom the first day of my administration, I have worked to make Maryland a state of service, and it is a mission that all of us collectively are on.\u201d\nThe program would be open to high school graduates and those who have an equivalent degree. The new department is in charge of the design and administration of the program, as well as creating a statewide network of participants and promoting the program to potential participants and employers.\n\u201cThe Service Year Option established by this bill will provide young people of every background and of every jurisdiction all throughout the state the opportunity to serve our state while also gaining real-world perspectives, skills and experience,\u201d Moore said.\nThis is not the first time the state of Maryland has expanded access to service. In 2016, HB1488 established the Maryland Corps, and was signed by former Gov. Larry Hogan in May of that year. The program aimed to provide service opportunities that addressed community needs across the state for at least 100 participants. Though a bill that expanded and revised the program passed the General Assembly last year, both the chair and executive director positions remain vacant.\nMoore\u2019s executive order establishing a state department to oversee service and civic engagement makes Maryland one of just a few other states to have these cabinet-level agencies. For example, in California, the state office California Volunteers, led by the state\u2019s Chief Service Officer Josh Fryday, helps to oversee Californians\u2019 civic engagement, service and volunteering.\n\u201cHaving a dedicated state agency is a powerful way to value the importance of service in our democratic society,\u201d said Fryday. \u201cGovernor Gavin Newsom is a strong proponent of service, elevating the position of California Chief Service Officer to Cabinet-level and investing millions into creating more opportunities. Under Governor Newsom\u2019s leadership, California Volunteers has been focused on creating more paid-service opportunities to tackle California\u2019s biggest challenges, such as pandemic-related education loss, food insecurity and the climate crisis. We are thrilled by Governor Moore\u2019s leadership to double down on the power of service, and know Maryland will benefit greatly as a result.\u201d\nSome of California Volunteers\u2019 programs include College Corps, which partners with campuses across the state to allow students to earn money to help pay for their education by placing them in community-based organizations to do service, Youth Jobs Corps, which partners with local governments and community organizations to provide jobs and job trainings to underserved youth and AmeriCorps.\n\u201cWe often describe service as a win-win-win. For individuals, they build connections, develop leadership skills, and gain valuable work experience. For the community, service builds connections between individuals of different beliefs, backgrounds and life experiences \u2013 helping to bridge divides in our too often polarized society. And for the whole state, we are investing in the next generation of leaders to address our greatest challenges,\u201d Fryday said. \u201cWe know service shapes lives and changes communities.\u201d\nHowever, some Republicans are unhappy with the way the Department of Civic and Service Innovation is being established so far in Maryland. According to a Feb. 22 press release from the Maryland Senate Republican Caucus, Republicans want more transparency on the department, and the ability to work with the governor on its creation.\nA secretary for this department has yet to be named by the Moore administration, something Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City, indicated in a news conference on Friday that the legislature was anxiously awaiting in order to move forward with the service year priority.\n\u201cFrom my perspective as the president of the Senate it is essential that all of the secretaries be named and up for consideration for the Senate by the time we leave session,\u201d said Ferguson.\nDespite these concerns, Moore is dedicated to making Maryland a state of service.\n\u201cService will help to save us, because it will help us get to know each other better,\u201d Moore said. \u201cService will give each person an opportunity to actually spend time with others who have a shared and a common understanding and who make sure that their fingerprints are on the future of this state.\u201d\nThis story has been corrected to fix the name of the website serviceyear.org.",

    "summary": "ChatGPT's introduction has prompted University of Maryland professors to reconsider their teaching methods and assessment criteria, emphasizing deeper understanding and practical application over surface-level knowledge. Professors are exploring how to integrate AI tools like ChatGPT into education, drawing parallels with the initial concerns over calculators in classrooms.",
    "content": "As the use of artificial intelligence in various industries continues to increase, the impact of OpenAI\u2019s language model ChatGPT on higher education has become increasingly significant.\nAt least, that\u2019s the line ChatGPT produced after it was prompted by CNS to write the lead of an article about its own influence on higher education. Although vague and unengaging, it\u2019s not incorrect.\nSince its release on Nov. 30, 2022, ChatGPT has been making headlines as an impressive chat bot powered by artificial intelligence (AI) with the capability to synthesize eerily human writing and dialogue.\u00a0\nChatGPT is the latest experiment born from the same AI research and development company that recently produced DALL-E 2, the AI image generator whose works can mimic the likes of Monet. OpenAI created ChatGPT via deep learning; programmers first combined the bot with an immense swath of text pulled from the internet, then used both human supervision and automated systems to train the system on how to respond to prompts using the text.\u00a0\nIt rocketed into the public consciousness, and the program set a record for the fastest-growing user base in history with 100 million users in January, Reuters reported. Educators have been left to consider its place in the classroom and its capacity for plagiarism.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom an educational perspective, it\u2019s perhaps an opportunity to reconsider how we assess student learning and student progress,\u201d University of Maryland computer science professor Hal Daum\u00e9 said.\u00a0\nSince ChatGPT can easily replicate basic understanding of certain concepts, Daum\u00e9 said he\u2019s been inputting his own assignment questions into the program to see if he needs to make them more difficult. He\u2019s not as interested in surface level responses, from students using ChatGPT or not.\u00a0\n\u201cI care that they understand this high-level concept, and I care that they can translate that into an implementation,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHe compared the recent release of ChatGPT to that of the calculator. At the time, there was a similar hysteria amongst educators concerned that computers would replace the need for students to learn foundational skills. While calculators are now universally used, mathematics professors still have their jobs.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in thinking about how we can teach students to use these tools responsibly,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nSeveral school districts, including Montgomery County and Baltimore County in Maryland, have banned the program outright. On the other hand, NPR reported an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania has incorporated it into their curriculum, and Daum\u00e9 mentioned a linguistics professor at the University of Maryland who has done the same.\u00a0\n\nDaum\u00e9 did imagine instances where it may make sense for a ban on ChatGPT, like in introductory classes that require assessments on entry-level concepts. He also aired its flaws: the program draws language from websites without attribution, and besides that, it\u2019s frequently inaccurate.\u00a0\nVirginia Byrne, an assistant professor in the School of Education and Urban Studies at Morgan State University, echoed the calculator analogy.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to teach with these technologies to help us instead of assuming the worst in people,\u201d Byrne said.\u00a0\nShe agreed that plagiarism using ChatGPT is a valid issue, but said that making assessments more creative could circumvent these concerns. Instead of an essay, consider having students make a podcast, presentation or demonstrate experiential learning, she suggested.\u00a0\nChatGPT has been proven to pass a law school exam, a high school chemistry exam and an AP English essay (although, it seems its chess strategy could use some work), and has quickly become a popular method of academic dishonesty. According to a poll by The Stanford Daily, 17% of Stanford students admitted to using ChatGPT in some capacity on their assignments and exams.\u00a0\nByrne cautioned against improper uses of ChatGPT by administration, citing the recent Vanderbilt University scandal in which the school used the language model to write a community email regarding the Michigan State University shooting. She voiced concerns that the clamor surrounding ChatGPT could elicit overreactions from professors.\n\u201cThere\u2019s concern that ChatGPT being out in the world will fuel some people\u2019s discriminatory accusations of cheating, against particularly people whose first language isn\u2019t English\u2026 That\u2019s why we want to lower the hysteria about plagiarism. And remember that people don\u2019t go to college just to cheat; that\u2019s not why our students are here,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nApril Logan, an associate professor in the Department of English at Salisbury University, read about ChatGPT in campus emails describing the pitfalls of the program and how to navigate concerns of plagiarism.\u00a0\nLogan conceded that the program presents a real temptation for students to cut corners, especially first generation students or those rundown and stressed that may be feeling overwhelmed.\u00a0\n\u201cHere we have just one more system or software that makes it easy for them to maybe not make the best choice,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nLike Byrne, she mentioned underlying biases in faculty could lead to more unfounded accusations of plagiarism, but she also questioned the biases built into ChatGPT itself. Could it be drawing from mostly Western, eurocentric texts, she wondered? In any case, Logan found it a bit lacking.\u00a0\n\u201cIt did seem a little soulless. And it was very, very general. What I\u2019m really interested in helping my students learn to do is to not be general; to be specific in their writing, to think critically, to go in depth.\u201d Logan said.\u00a0\nAs far as writing instruction, Logan said ChatGPT could be a great tool for showing students the impact of authorial voice and the difference between summary and analysis. She likened the program\u2019s output to the James Brown song \u201cTalkin\u2019 Loud and Sayin\u2019 Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cChatGPT is very seductive because from a technical standpoint, it\u2019s well written. But is it actually giving us some real information or real meat?\u201d\nLooking to the future, Logan wondered about the possibilities language AI offers to education and to the literary world.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not just afraid, but curious to see where it goes. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019m confident in my colleagues and the University System of Maryland, we\u2019re up to the challenge.\u201d",

Policies vary widely, with some banning on-campus betting or prohibiting student-athletes from gambling, but few address off-campus activities.",
    "content": "College students are in the highest risk group for problem gambling, yet universities have been slow to create policies, educational programs or restrictions on sports betting, according to a survey by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.\nThat\u2019s despite the aggressive expansion of sports gambling and abundant advertising at some college campuses \u2014 on scoreboards and banners at athletic events, on academic buildings and even in campus emails.\nThe Povich and Howard centers asked 145 Division I public universities in the states where sports betting is legal to share their campus policies addressing gambling. The centers could only confirm that 23% had published sports betting policies.\nMary Drexler, program director for the Maryland Center of Excellence on Problem Gambling at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said young adults \u201care at a higher risk \u2026 for developing a problem\u201d with gambling.\n\u201cWe would like to see more colleges and universities, if they don\u2019t have a policy, [to] develop a policy,\u201d Drexler said.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nAmong the universities that responded and have addressed gambling, bans on betting are rare.\nPurdue University prohibits betting on Purdue sports. Stony Brook University in New York advises students that they may not gamble for money or other valuables on university property or in university facilities except as part of an authorized fundraising activity, essentially banning on-campus wagering.\nOther policies don\u2019t address differences between sports bets placed on or off campus. Some only address state law, while some prohibit gambling by student-athletes, based on NCAA policy.\nKeith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, said college students\u2019 vulnerability to sports betting could be linked to a variety of factors, including interest in sports, belief in one\u2019s own skill and the underdevelopment of the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex, which helps control impulsive behavior but isn\u2019t fully developed until age 25.\nStelianos Canallatos, prevention manager for the New York Council on Problem Gambling, said he would advise colleges to prohibit gambling entirely since the legal age for gambling in most states is 21 and surveys show a majority of students at four-year universities are 21 and younger.\nIn studies conducted from 2007 to 2014, researchers found that 75% to 80% of college students had gambled in the past year. Opportunities to bet have expanded since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to sports betting in 2018.\nThe ruling of the Supreme Court left it to each state to decide whether to allow legal bets on sports events. According to the American Gambling Association, sports betting is legal in 36 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe growth in betting has been explosive. Bettors wagered more than $57 billion on sports in 2021, according to the American Gambling Association, and college sports draw a big share of gamblers\u2019 money. For example, in Colorado, bettors wagered more than $170 million on college basketball in February and March 2022, when conference and national tournaments are played.\nSportsbooks, which take in bets and pay out winnings, have marketed their platforms heavily and made deals with universities across the country.\n\nUniversities and their Sports Betting Deals\nCaesars Sportsbook, PointsBet USA and other betting companies are seeking a marketing edge in agreements to promote their brands on college campuses.\nBy Matthew Wynn\n\n\n\n\n\n \nmarylandLSUMichiganStatecoloradouniversityofdenverUniversityofNevadaLasVegasUniversity of Nevada Reno \n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan State University and Louisiana State University have deals with Caesars Sportsbook, and the University of Maryland and University of Colorado Boulder have deals with PointsBet.\nThe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has a contract with DraftKings that includes an on-campus gaming innovation studio bearing the company\u2019s name.\nThe four schools partnered with PointsBet and Caesars have agreements that go beyond ads in stadiums and on broadcasts. A campus-wide email campaign from Caesars targeted anyone on LSU Athletics\u2019 email list, offering free bets for an initial wager. PointsBet has a banner ad that has shown up on the Maryland Athletics website\u2019s homepage, one displaying a hook offering $500 in free bets.\nThe University of Colorado Boulder released details of an agreement negotiated with the sportsbook PointsBet in response to a public information request from the Povich and Howard centers. It included a $30 referral fee \u2014 since discontinued \u2014 to be paid to the university when someone used Colorado\u2019s promo code to sign up, deposited money and placed a bet.\n\nIn November, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut,, wrote a letter to Caesars CEO Tom Reeg criticizing Caesars\u2019 advertising on college campuses.\n\u201cI call on you to end this disgraceful practice in order to protect students and prevent the irreparable harm that will be caused by Caesars\u2019 marketing practices and college partnerships,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.\nThe American Gambling Association, an industry lobbying group, publishes a \u201cResponsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering,\u201d which member companies agree to follow.\nThe code says, \u201cSports wagering advertisements should not be placed in media outlets (including social media) that appeal primarily to those below the legal age for sports wagering, nor should they be displayed at an event venue where most of the audience at many of the events at the venue is reasonably expected to be below the legal age for sports wagering.\u201d\nThe code also says sports betting should not be advertised or promoted on campus.\nNeither Caesars nor PointsBet is a member of the AGA. Both companies have advertised during games \u2014 Caesars at LSU and Michigan State, PointsBet at the University of Maryland and Colorado.\nTom McMillen, a former Maryland congressman who played basketball at the University of Maryland and in the NBA, told the Povich and Howard centers that he sees gambling as a danger to college athletics.\nHe said there is a \u201c100% probability\u201d that a major sports betting scandal will occur one day.\n\n\u201cA gambling scandal \u2026 will subsume everything else good about the university.\u201d\n\u2014 Tom McMillen, former U.S. representative and former NBA player\n\nThere\u2019s already evidence that, despite an NCAA prohibition, college athletes bet on sports. A 2017 study showed that 24% of NCAA male athletes bet on sports and 13% reported in-game betting, a type of bet that is more susceptible to what the NCAA calls \u201cspot fixing,\u201d in which a particular play, not the entire game, is fixed to satisfy betting odds.\nAt Purdue, faculty, students and staff have been banned from betting on Purdue sports teams since 2019, though sports betting is legal in Indiana.\nFormer Purdue University President Mitch Daniels acknowledged enforcement is difficult. But in a November email to the Povich and Howard centers, he said the policy \u201cseems to have been accepted university wide.\u201d\n\u201cNo complaints. No allegations. No enforcement actions,\u201d wrote Daniels, who stepped down in December. \u201cWe hope it stays that way.\u201d\nMcMillen doubts it will.\n\u201cWhen it happens, when you do have a scandal, the president of the university will be flayed across the [newspaper],\u201d McMillen said. \u201cA gambling scandal \u2026 will subsume everything else good about the university.\u201d\nVictoria Ifatusin contributed to this story.\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

    "content": "College campuses increasingly are striking deals with sports betting companies eager to promote their brands in stadiums, on radio broadcasts and on athletic department websites \u2014 places where they can be seen and heard by students. But the terms of those agreements are opaque despite the high-dollar and societal stakes.\nLouisiana State University, Michigan State University and the University of Maryland have made their agreements through third-party companies, firms set up to sell sports sponsorships on behalf of the schools. That means the agreements can be shielded from public view; open records laws don\u2019t apply to privately held companies.\nThat lack of transparency concerns gambling addiction experts and others already troubled by the impact of legalized sports betting on college campuses.\n\u201cAnytime that you can\u2019t be transparent about something you\u2019re doing, it probably indicates that there are some issues,\u201d said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. \u201cThese colleges should be very concerned about the impact of gambling addiction among especially underage students.\u201d\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nMaryland Del. Jared Solomon, D-Montgomery County, vice chair of the Education and Economic Development Subcommittee, said he was unaware of the third-party deals and wanted to hear from university officials about why the sports betting contract for the University of Maryland isn\u2019t available to the public.\n\u201cAs a policymaker and a taxpayer, I would like to know what agreements our system is entering into that are going to have an impact on our students and are going to have an impact on the bottom line of the university,\u201d Solomon said.\nAs part of a four-month investigation into sports betting on college campuses, The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland sought contracts from LSU, Michigan State and three other universities known to have sports betting brands as sponsors:\n\u2022 University of Colorado Boulder\n\u2022 University of Denver\n\u2022 University of Maryland\nAll but the University of Denver are public universities and therefore are subject to open records requests under public information laws.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada, Reno, each had a sponsorship deal with sports betting company William Hill. Those agreements with the company, which was acquired by Caesars Sportsbook in 2021, have ended.\nBoth Nevada schools continue to have betting partners, however. UNLV is allied with DraftKings in a branding deal that includes an on-campus gaming innovation studio. At the University of Nevada, Reno, a local casino hosts the weekly radio broadcasts of the men\u2019s basketball and football coaches.\n\n\u201cThese colleges should be very concerned about the impact of gambling addiction among especially underage students.\u201d\n\u2014 Keith Whyte, National Council on Problem Gambling executive director\n\nOf the five schools with the most extensive ties to sports betting brands, only CU Boulder released its agreement in response to a public records request from the Povich and Howard centers. Most of the others replied that they did not have deals with sports betting companies.\nHowever, in January 2022, Michigan State Athletics announced its deal with Caesars Sportsbook in a press release. A month earlier, Maryland announced a deal with betting platform PointsBet under the headline, \u201cPointsBet Named Official Partner of University of Maryland Athletics.\u201d\nThe betting companies made their deals not with the schools but with private sports marketing companies aligned with the schools, according to officials at Michigan State and Maryland.\nMichigan State, Maryland and LSU are represented by sports marketing company Playfly Sports, the \u201cmarketing and multimedia rights holder for some of the most prestigious collegiate teams, high school state associations and sports venues across the country,\u201d according to the company website.\nPlayfly did not respond to interview requests from the Povich and Howard centers.\nLike Learfield, another large sports marketing firm, Playfly represents high-profile college sports programs often selling sponsorship deals to become \u201cofficial partners.\u201d\nSports marketing companies Playfly and Learfield take the risk, although they can make back their investment and more if they close enough lucrative deals. Athletic departments also benefit because they can count on a set payment from a marketing company each year.\nSome privately held sports marketing companies create other private companies organized to only handle the deals with the campuses. For example, PointsBet\u2019s \u201cofficial partner\u201d deal with Maryland is instead with Maryland Sports Properties, a private company created by Playfly. Maryland Sports Properties negotiates all marketing and media rights for the university\u2019s athletics program.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhen the Povich and Howard centers requested the PointsBet agreement from Maryland Sports Properties, General Manager Jack Krabbe replied in an email that Maryland Sports Properties was not required to share it.\nLSU and Michigan State also declined requests for their agreements. LSU stated that the university is \u201cnot a custodian\u201d of the contract. Michigan State responded to the request with the school\u2019s multimedia rights contract with FOX Sports, an agreement that the Povich and Howard centers hadn\u2019t asked for. Michigan State never provided its sports betting agreement.\nMaryland also did not release its contract. A public records officer told the Povich and Howard centers, \u201cAthletics has confirmed that UMD does not have an agreement with PointsBet,\u201d even though the university refers to PointsBet as an \u201cofficial partner\u201d of Maryland Athletics.\nRebecca Snyder, executive director of the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association, a nonprofit that advocates for public access to government and other records, said, \u201cSports betting is a huge industry, and the public needs to understand how that\u2019s affecting their publicly funded universities. I think it\u2019s very convenient that there are no public records.\u201d\nBrian Ullmann, the University of Maryland\u2019s vice president for marketing and communications, said the relationship between Maryland Athletics and PointsBet \u201cis not a contract between the university and sponsor. It\u2019s a contract between Playfly and a sponsor.\u201d\nIn all, Playfly has signed approximately 63 sponsorship deals for Maryland, according to Ullmann, who added the university has four other sponsorship deals that were signed directly with the university. Those include agreements with Pepsi and Under Armour, he said.\nThough a private company, Maryland Sports Properties has a close relationship with the university. Maryland Sports Properties has an office at Xfinity Center, the athletic venue where many Terps sports teams play and where coaches and sports administrators have offices. The familiar red \u201cM\u201d of Maryland Athletics is on the door of the Maryland Sports Properties offices.\nThe firm\u2019s employees also have university email addresses. In October, at least four, including Krabbe, had accounts listed in the university directory ending in \u201cumd.edu.\u201d\nUllmann said he was unaware the workers had university-issued email addresses. Asked why employees of a privately held company would have Maryland accounts, he said Maryland Sports Properties employees would\u2019ve been issued umd.edu emails \u201cin order to access systems, including COVID compliance requirements.\u201d\nSolomon, the Maryland legislator, said he would like more details on the University of Maryland contract and hoped that release of the sports betting agreement \u201cwould not rise to the level of requiring legislation.\u201d\nSolomon added, \u201cThis is the kind of thing that I hope with a conversation and some publicity around it, people would do the right thing.\u201d\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

The initiative, funded by a grant from the National Council on Problem Gambling, targets a vulnerable age group where addictive behaviors often emerge.",
    "content": "When Towson University students pick up their phones on campus and open a designated app, they may see an ad seeking to teach them about responsible gambling.\nThe in-app banner ad, sent at random, advises them to \u201cPAWS\u201d: \u201cPlan ahead, Always know your limits, Wait to play again/wager again, Stop while you\u2019re ahead.\u201d\nWith this marketing campaign, Towson is stepping in front of a trend: explosive growth of sports betting across the U.S., including on college campuses.\nIn studies conducted from 2007 to 2014, researchers found that 75% to 80% of college students had gambled in the previous year. Opportunities to bet have expanded since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to sports betting in 2018.\nA grant from the National Council on Problem Gambling has helped the Baltimore-area college create what it hopes will become a national model for what a university can do to help its students.\n\u201cThe hope and the goal [is] that we can really develop some incredible work that sets the standard for other universities to tackle this topic,\u201d said Jaclyn Webber of the university\u2019s Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Prevention Center. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of evidence-based information out there about gambling prevention.\u201d\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nKeith Whyte, executive director of the problem gambling council, said his organization selected Towson for the grant because \u201cwe believe that preventing high-risk populations was the area that had the least amount of funding and could make the biggest impact.\u201d\nJoshua B. Grubbs, a professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University who studies addiction, said college students \u201care at that age group where we start to really begin to see addictive tendencies emerge.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to drive fast and get speeding tickets, you\u2019re more likely to try illicit substances, you\u2019re more likely to binge drink, right? You\u2019re also more likely to try gambling,\u201d Grubbs said, referring to the vulnerabilities of young adult men. \u201cBecause of that, you\u2019re more likely to encounter something that you may later develop an addiction to.\u201d\nTowson University is implementing a program, \u201cTigers Play Responsibly,\u201d that seeks to educate students through robust anti-problem gambling workshops and marketing campaigns.\nFunded by the National Council on Problem Gambling\u2019s $40,000 Agility Grant, educators work tables at sporting events, conduct giveaways, maintain a messaging campaign on social media and geo-target mobile advertising to students at sporting events or near sports venues with messages designed to prevent problem gambling. In partnership with Towson\u2019s athletics program, the \u201cTigers Play Responsibly\u201d ad campaign also is featured in athletics publications and on bus panels near athletics sites.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that the school provides it,\u201d said Peter Ariano, a Towson senior and frequent sports gambler. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that\u2019s a dire need for colleges.\u201d\nSusan Foss, a parent of a 23-year-old who gambles, said, \u201cI think anytime you can reach even a small segment of the population, it\u2019s valid.\u201d\nBut not everyone has faith in the service\u2019s ability to reach and assist dedicated gamblers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any Towson student is going to listen to an outreach on responsible sports betting,\u201d said Mike Koanang, a Towson senior and frequent sports bettor. \u201cI think they\u2019re just going to go with their flow \u2014 whatever has been making them win money.\u201d\nThere are limits to what can be achieved by the nascent program at Towson. It has a relatively small pool of funds and a short time frame to work with. The grant expires in March and the university must provide metrics showing success to get additional funds.\nEven if more money isn\u2019t forthcoming, Webber said the program has developed a \u201clot of material and lots of information\u201d that they can continue to use.\nEmily Wiegand, assistant director and manager of substance education, treatment and prevention services in Towson\u2019s Counseling Center, said few, if any, schools have a program of awareness and education as extensive as Towson\u2019s.\n\u201cWhen we were writing the grant, we did a pretty thorough search to see if other schools were doing things to try and get some ideas for our own application,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cWe found a few schools that have a gambling screening available, but could not find any comprehensive gambling prevention programs along the lines of what we planned to develop here at Towson.\u201d\nJames P. Whelan, the director of The Institute for Gambling Education and Research at the University of Memphis, said he admires the work Towson has done. But its $40,000 grant is \u201ca drop in the bucket.\u201d\nFunding for problem gambling research and support is not consistent, Whelan said. None of the $7.6 billion in annual federal gambling tax revenue goes to help prevent or treat gambling addiction, according to the problem gambling council. Instead, research relies on how much money a state or institution is willing to allocate to the issues.\n\u201cIf Congress says, \u2018Hey, we need money to research gambling disorders,\u2019 then the money will be there. But they haven\u2019t done that,\u201d Grubbs said.\n\u201cIf Congress says, \u2018Hey, we need money to research gambling disorders,\u2019 then the money will be there. But they haven\u2019t done that.\u201d\n\u2014 Joshua B. Grubbs, Bowling Green State psychology professor\n\nPublic opinion is not driving additional spending. According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of adults say sports betting legalization is neither a good nor bad thing for society.\nOther universities have responded to sports betting changes by trying to influence legislation in hopes of distancing college sports betting from their campuses.\nPresidents of major universities in Virginia and Massachusetts sent letters to their respective state legislatures, urging them to oppose legislation they contend would create problems for students.\nIn Virginia, the legalization of betting on in-state college sports teams passed in the Senate of Virginia, but died in the House of Delegates.\n\u201cI would guess that the drivers [of the policy failing in the House] were influenced by the presidents,\u201d said Virginia state Sen. T. Montgomery \u201cMonty\u201d Mason. \u201cObviously presidents of colleges and universities should have a great deal of influence on any higher education policy.\u201d\nIn Massachusetts, seven school presidents and six athletics directors from universities ranging from Harvard to Merrimack College wrote a letter urging legislators to remove college sports betting from the proposed policy.\n\u201cBased on our years of experience, each of us believes that such legislation will create unnecessary and unacceptable risks to student athletes, their campus peers, and the integrity and culture of colleges and universities in the Commonwealth,\u201d university officials wrote.\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 While the teaching of Black history is under fire and facing censorship in some states like Florida, two Maryland lawmakers have proposed legislation aimed at providing more federal support to promote and preserve Black history, culture and education.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume and Sen. Ben Cardin, both Maryland Democrats, introduced their measures on Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month.\nThe legislation would create a council of 12 presidential appointees to advise the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) on promoting Black voices, ensuring that Black history and culture is recognized in schools, providing resources to preserve Black history, and recommending national policies that would generate improved public understanding of African American history and culture.\n\u201cAfrican American history is American history,\u201d Cardin said in a statement. \u201cFor too long our history lessons failed to fully acknowledge the role of Black Americans. And it happens in far more places than schools \u2013 so much of what we have learned for generations about history, music, culture and more has diminished the role of African American creators, writers, musicians and beyond.\u201d\n\u201cThis bill pushes back against the attacks on African American history in our schools and communities,\u201d Mfume said in a statement. \u201cWe must ensure that Black history is told fully and accurately in America. While the truth of our journey may not be the easiest to tell, it should be protected and celebrated because the story of African American people is intricate and integral to the story of the United States of America \u2013 that history must be treated and admired as such.\u201d\nSchool courses on African American history are generating political controversy. A new Advanced Placement African American studies course, which is currently being piloted across the country, has come under fire recently.\nGov. Ron DeSantis, R-Florida, and the Florida Department of Education attacked some of the topics being covered in the course, including so-called critical race theory and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe AP course\u2019s official framework has since been revised. Supporters of Black history education claim that texts by scholars focusing on critical race theory have been removed from the course and that essential topics were left out. According to a statement from the College Board, however, no such changes were made.\n\u201cWe must also clarify that no Black scholars or authors have been removed from the course. In fact, contemporary scholars and authors are never mandated in any AP framework,\u201d the College Board said in a Feb. 8 letter to the Florida Department of Education.\nThe College Board also wrote that no topics were removed because \u201cthey lacked educational value.\u201d\nIn an updated statement on Feb. 11, the College Board said it should have been more clear about the framework and topics of the course, differentiated between the final curriculum and the early framework, and denounced the Florida Department of Education\u2019s \u201cslander\u201d of the course.\nThe course is being piloted in Maryland at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, part of Baltimore City Public Schools, and is one of only 60 schools in the country participating in the pilot program during the 2022-2023 school year.\nIn a Feb. 1 tweet, Cardin wrote that he was proud that the course is being piloted in Baltimore.\n\u201cAny kind of censoring or shielding students from #BlackHistory is a disservice to our nation & the people who came before us. Black History IS this nation\u2019s history,\u201d the senator said.\nAs of December, 31 students were enrolled in the AP course, according to Dennis Jutras, coordinator of Gifted and Advanced Learning at Baltimore City Public Schools. The district has not received any direct responses from students or families regarding the course, which \u201cis typically the case when things are going well,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe problem is that traditional history classes do not give equal bandwidth to all voices,\u201d added Jutras, who taught AP U.S. History for nine years. \u201cAP African American Studies \u2013 what it\u2019s doing is trying to balance the equation and giving a greater bandwidth to part of U.S. history that is oftentimes neglected.\u201d\nJutras said the legislation proposed by Cardin and Mfume would have minimal impact in Baltimore City schools.\n\u201cI definitely see a need for it in maybe some other districts in the state of Maryland,\u201d Jutras said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cAnd, of course, if national legislation would follow, there\u2019s certainly states that could use those kinds of protections, but in Baltimore City, we have a long history of genuinely appreciating academic freedom.\u201d\nAt a hearing earlier this month by the House Education and the Workforce Committee, Virginia Gentles, director of the Education Freedom Center at the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a conservative nonprofit, said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports the teaching of African American history in schools.\nHowever, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think from a federal perspective that Congress needs to get involved in what a state should or shouldn\u2019t teach. That isn\u2019t the role of the federal government.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Florida, defended his state\u2019s choice to restrict the teaching of critical race theory.\n\u201cLet\u2019s teach subjects that matter, reading, writing, arithmetic. The so-called CRT, (critical race theory) we\u2019ve said \u2018no\u2019 in the state of Florida, \u2018no\u2019 to CRT. There\u2019s no value. There\u2019s no value to teach kids to hate each other based on race. There\u2019s no value in teaching kids to feel guilty just because they\u2019re of a certain race,\u201d Bean said.\nRep. Susan Wild, D-Pennsylvania, countered: \u201cCRT, otherwise known as critical race theory, is not taught in K-12 schools ever. This is a talking point that has been used by the opposition party to try to inflame parents and people and it is simply not done, and we need to stop talking about it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Del. Robin Grammer has proposed HB0137 to protect teachers from civil liability when disciplining students, aiming to address teacher concerns about potential lawsuits for intervening in student misconduct.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 School staff would receive protection from lawsuits stemming from discipling students under a proposed bill from Del. Robin Grammer, R-Baltimore, that is set to be heard in the General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have significant problems with public education,\u201d Grammer told Capital News Service on Thursday. \u201cThe discipline issues are real, very real, despite the politicking around it.\u201d Teachers are afraid to intervene in bullying and other disciplinary problems for fear of lawsuits, and, he said, that\u2019s meant fewer teachers or teachers leaving the profession early.\nMelissa Dirks, president of the Frederick County Teachers Association, agrees.\n\u201cEven though educators still are showing up every day doing the best they can with the resources\u2014the very short resources\u2014that we are given, the same respect is not being shown in all segments of the community,\u201d she told Capital News Service on Friday.\u00a0\nThe proposed bill, HB0137, aims to protect teachers who intervene in fights or other cases of student misconduct from any civil liability they may face regarding property damage or personal injury, provided they acted in good faith and without negligence. A hearing on the bill is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25, before the House Judiciary Committee; it will also be livestreamed on YouTube.\nCurrent law states that the county board of education is held financially responsible in the event that an educator is sued and damages are awarded against them. The Code of Maryland Regulations also ensures that as of now, the county board must provide legal counsel to school staff if the action was performed \u201cwithout malice\u201d and if they were \u201cacting within authorized official capacity.\u201d\nDirks noted that the proposed bill would not alter current law too drastically, but would lay out specifically what a school staff member would and would not be liable for, and in what situations.\n\u201cAny time we can bring clarity and make sure that educators are allowed to intercede to protect students without fear is a good thing,\u201d she said.\nThat was Grammer\u2019s goal in introducing the bill during this session, even though a nearly identical one failed in the 2020 session.\n\u201cYou look for simple ways that you could positively change policy to better the environment, regardless of what policy scope you\u2019re looking at,\u201d said Grammer. \u201cI thought this was a really positive bill. It\u2019s not revolutionary or groundbreaking, but it\u2019s something you could do. It\u2019s a little tweak that you can make to just tell teachers, if you\u2019re stepping in to prevent someone from getting hurt, we have your back.\u201d\nHe hopes the bill will give teachers more ability to control their classroom\u2019s environment in a way that best serves their students.\u00a0\n\u201cMaking sure our students are safe is always paramount, and we\u2019ve seen it time and time again where educators put their bodies on the line for their students,\u201d said Dirks. \u201cThat happens with or without this piece of legislation, but it is good for educators to know that they are supported by lawmakers and the law in this situation.\u201d\nThe act was first introduced during the 2020 Regular Session by former Delegate and Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Cox. In addition to Cox and Grammer, 32 other delegates, including six Democrats still in the House,\u00a0 sponsored the bill, then called HB802.\n\u201cYou know, Delegate Cox tended to be a controversial person, and I suspect towards the end there, that\u2019s probably why it failed,\u201d Grammar said. \u201cSo I figured we bring it back, \u2026 give it a shot and see if we can get it done.\u201d\nIn his testimony on the bill in 2020, Cox told lawmakers that teachers face challenges they didn\u2019t expect.\n\u201cA teacher should not need to worry about personal liability when intervening in a small scuffle or a schoolwide brawl,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cTeachers should not have to worry that they will be sued if they stop one student from inflicting harm on another.\u201d\nDirks, who also testified for the bill in 2020, agreed with Cox then on what the role of teachers should be.\u00a0\n\u201cEducators need to be able to focus our attention on the academic needs and physical safety of our students without fearing reprisal or risk of civil liability as a result of good faith actions aimed at protecting them,\u201d said Dirks in her 2020 written testimony.\nWhile it passed in the House on March 11, 2020, the bill died after being referred to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. Grammer said he hopes that with the freshman members of the House looking at it with new eyes, the bill will have enough support to become law.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s well written, it\u2019s very short. It\u2019s passed unanimously and had bipartisan support,\u201d Grammer said of the bill and its predecessor. \u201cI think one of the opportunities this year is really to walk through all this policy and have the freshman members hear a lot of it, and for them it\u2019s going to be brand new.\u201d\nGrammer said the current bill is the same as that passed by the House of Delegates during the 2020 legislative session.\u00a0 This includes an amendment suggested by the Maryland Association for Justice that further specifies the staff member must have intervened in a \u201creasonably prudent manner\u201d and the actions were not \u201cgrossly negligent, willful, wanton, or intentionally tortious.\u201d\n\u201cWe worked with this bill sponsor back in 2020 to improve the immunity provision to include a standard of conduct of reasonable prudence under the circumstances so that the bill was more clear in what conduct would be protected and what conduct would not be protected,\u201d said George Tolley, who was MAJ\u2019s legislative chair in 2020, of their proposed amendments.\u00a0\nThose who wish to testify on this bill will do so at the hearing on the 25. If passed, this act would go into effect Oct. 1.",

The goal is to win entry into the college of his choice.\u00a0\n\u201cWe get paid to better ourselves and have fun,\u201d Askins said.\u00a0\nThe McElderry Park Community Association, backed by funding from foundations, is trying to reverse a dire trend in its community. One out of every two children in McElderry Park is living in poverty, almost double the citywide rate, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA). The high poverty leads to a decline in high school graduation rates and lower college attendance rates, according to the American Psychological Association. As of 2020, over 30% of students in McElderry Park did not complete high school, according to BNIA.\u00a0\nTo address this need, the McElderry Park Community Association began youth council programs in 2015 following Freddie Gray\u2019s death from injuries suffered in police custody, said Teddy Rosemond Jr., former McElderry Park resident and former vice president of the group. David Harris, the association\u2019s president, said in addition to the SAT and ACT test preparation, the program will take the youth on college tours. \u201cWe help them with their enrollment package \u2026 scholarship money, whatever they need,\u201d Harris, 52, said.\nThe student stipends are funded by YouthWorks, a Baltimore City organization, in partnership with the McElderry Park Community Association, said Rhonda McKinney, 51, program manager for the McElderry Park Community Association. Funding also comes from foundations, such as the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, and the Johns Hopkins Office of Government and Community Affairs, Harris said. Other funding comes from work performed by the McElderry Park association, such as picking up trash and debris from construction sites.\nRosemond, 22, grew up in McElderry Park, and is a co-founder of the McElderry Park Youth Council and a former vice president of the group. Rosemond is now a software engineer and said his time working with the youth council taught him a lot of interpersonal skills that have helped him in his career.\u00a0\n\u201cI was able to learn how to pitch myself, my purpose, my vision to apply for jobs,\u201d Rosemond said. \u201cI always wanted to help others and that\u2019s kind of what I tie into my work now.\u201d\nErnest Smith, 62, the McElderry Park Community Association treasurer, said the group wants to partner with nearby communities to expand these youth programs and \u201cdevelop a hub through which we can support one another.\u201d McElderry Park\u2019s youth programs have also partnered with some schools outside of the neighborhood, including Patterson High School and Forest Park High School.\nAskins said the paid stipend and SAT prep initially attracted him but he discovered the program had many more benefits. He recalled a guest speaker who described how he started from nothing and was able to turn his life around. \u201cHe\u2019s a great mentor to the youth,\u201d Askins said of the speaker. \u201cHe just [told] us how we can make it without being on the street.\u201d\nAskins said YouthWorks showed how he can be successful in Baltimore. He plans to attend college and return to give back to his hometown.\nAskins highly recommends the program. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we don\u2019t have a packed room every year,\u201d Askins said.",

    "summary": "Baltimore City teacher salaries, especially for those with master\u2019s degrees, have declined significantly over the past decade, falling to the lowest in Maryland and far below other districts like Montgomery County. Additionally, starting teacher salaries in Baltimore have risen only slightly since 2000, now ranking among the lowest in the state.",
    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 In Baltimore City, the Maryland community with the highest numbers of needy students and the most demand for experienced teachers, the salaries of teachers with a master\u2019s degree decreased from 2010 to 2020 to the lowest in the state, according to data from the Maryland State Department of Education.\nThe average salaries for Baltimore teachers with a master\u2019s degree declined from $72,758 in 2010, when it was among the middle of pay for such teachers in the state, to $64,405 in 2020, the data shows. The salary was more than $8,000 lower than what teachers with master\u2019s degrees were paid in Garrett County, the next lowest pay for a Maryland school district.\nIt is a far cry from the earnings of teachers with master\u2019s degrees in 2020 in Montgomery County, who made the highest salary in the state at $108,108, Baltimore County at $95,454, Prince George\u2019s County at $95,636 or Anne Arundel at $90,811, according to the state\u2019s data.\nFrom 2010 to 2020, every Maryland school district except Baltimore City experienced increases in salaries for teachers with a master\u2019s degree, according to state data. Montgomery County Public Schools teachers saw an 11.5% increase. Salaries for teachers with master\u2019s degrees increased by over 15% in Baltimore and Prince George\u2019s counties, by 10.7% in Anne Arundel County and by 3.8% in Frederick County.\nBaltimore City teachers with master\u2019s degrees experienced an 11.4% decrease.\n\nAdditionally, salaries for beginning Baltimore City teachers, those with bachelor\u2019s degrees and a standard professional certificate, have also fallen dramatically behind other Maryland school systems, according to the state data.\nIn 2000, a beginning teacher in Baltimore City earned $51,996, which was then the highest salary of any starting teacher in Maryland, the data shows.\u00a0Over the next 20 years, salaries for those teachers rose a mere $2,695 to $54,691 and ranked 20th among the state\u2019s 24 school systems.\nIn that same time frame, teacher salaries increased by over $17,000 in Baltimore County, by over $20,000 in Howard, Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties and by over $34,000 in Cecil County. Baltimore City was the only school system not to see an increase of at least $10,000 over that 20-year period, according to state data.\n\nCapital News Service reached out beginning in October to Sherry Christian, the Baltimore City school system\u2019s media relations manager, and other Baltimore City Public Schools officials for an explanation on how and why Baltimore teachers\u2019 salaries had fallen so dramatically behind other Maryland teachers. Neither Christian nor other officials responded to repeated requests.\nCristina Duncan Evans is the teachers chapter chair for the Baltimore Teachers Union. Duncan Evans said she had not heard of the dramatic decline in salaries for teachers with master\u2019s degrees or how far salaries for starting teachers had fallen behind in relation to other Maryland counties until contacted by Capital News Service.\nStill, she said, she was not surprised at the findings.\nDuncan Evans explained that school systems in Maryland recruit beginning teachers largely from outside their counties, so they need to offer attractive salaries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t keep up with the other school systems, you are going to fall behind. It\u2019s a sign that our district has not put much effort in competing with other counties.\u00a0We\u2019ve been fighting with the district to increase salaries for beginning teachers,\u00a0but they haven\u2019t made that a priority.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a position that impacts our students.\u201d\nThe highest rate of turnover among Baltimore City teachers is among beginning instructors, she said.\u00a0 More than one of every three Baltimore City school teachers have been in the classroom five years or less, according to the Fund for Educational Excellence 2021-2022 survey.\nThe salaries for Baltimore City teachers with master\u2019s degrees began to decline the same year the city\u2019s public school system began using a new way to determine teacher\u2019s salaries called the Career Pathways System, state data shows.\nThe system, which was agreed upon by Baltimore City Public Schools and the Baltimore Teachers Union, is a departure from a traditional pay system that rewards teachers for experience and educational attainment.\nDuncan Evans said she also wasn\u2019t surprised that salaries for master\u2019s teachers had declined.\u00a0 They decreased, she explained, because Baltimore City teachers\u2019 \u201ccontract doesn\u2019t compensate for a master\u2019s degree,\u201d as do the reward systems in other Maryland counties.\n\u201cWe have a system that rewards professional development and relies on a peer reviewed portfolio and teacher evaluations to advance,\u201d she said. \u201cTeacher evaluations are the single biggest way that people move in our system.\u201d\nAccording to the city school\u2019s website, the structure allows teachers in Baltimore City to \u201ctake control of their careers and grow within a system of career pathways and salary intervals.\u201d Movement from one pathway to the next is determined by \u201cpeer reviews that weigh instruction, leadership, continual learning and student growth,\u201d the website said.\nFor years, teachers in\u00a0 Maryland and other states pursued master\u2019s degrees in part because the additional education\u00a0 was rewarded by school systems through a significant increase in pay.\nDuncan Evans said the teachers\u2019 union and the school system decided in 2010\u00a0 to stop rewarding teachers solely for achieving a master\u2019s degree because some studies showed it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean teachers become better at their jobs.\nMost other Maryland school systems continue to reward teachers financially after they earn a master\u2019s degree.\n\u201cJust because they do it, doesn\u2019t mean they are right,\u201d Duncan Evans said.\nBut she also agreed that the decision by the Baltimore City school system doesn\u2019t mean the other Maryland school systems are wrong.\nThe Maryland State Board of Education requires all public school teachers to complete a master\u2019s degree after 10 years of teaching.\nDespite the differences in pay for Baltimore City teachers and those other counties, a survey of Baltimore teachers conducted at the end of the 2021-22 school year found Baltimore teachers are largely satisfied with their pay.\n\u201cThe salary they can earn under the Career Pathways for Teachers model and the benefits package are major factors in overall teacher satisfaction,\u201d teachers told surveyors for the Fund for Educational Excellence. \u201cSeveral teachers say that they would not be able to find a teaching job that pays as well in any of the neighboring school districts; a move would mean having to leave the classroom for an administrative position.\u201d\nDuncan Evans, however, said the study also showed opinions more evenly split on salaries.\n\u201cTeachers said compensation was just as much an issue for leaving (the school system) as it was a reason for staying,\u201d she said.\nThe challenges of teaching in Baltimore City schools and the needs of the system\u2019s children have been well documented. For example, of Maryland public schools ranked by percentage of students who qualify for free lunch, 40 of the top 75 were in Baltimore City, according to Public School Review, a service that provides information on public schools using data from federal and state education agencies.\nTonya Shelby is graduate program professor and advisor at Towson University\u2019s College of Education where she teaches undergraduate students and current teachers who are working toward a masters\u2019 degree.\n\u201cI tell my students that teachers with that master\u2019s level knowledge can bring so much perspective to a struggling school,\u201d she said.\nTeachers with master\u2019s degrees make better teachers and they also can help other teachers work through problems with their classes, Shelby said.\nDwayne, a Baltimore City school teacher who asked to use his middle name, because of privacy concerns, said the many issues Baltimore students grapple with unrelated to education are why it is important to have teachers with master\u2019s degrees.\n\u201cFor some of these kids, school is the last thing on their minds,\u201d Dwayne said. \u201cSome of them have a toxic home life and others can\u2019t even tell you the next time they\u2019re going to eat an actual meal.\u201d\nDwayne, who has his master\u2019s degree and has been a teacher for over a decade, said the extra challenges that come with teaching kids in Baltimore may be too much to handle for younger, inexperienced teachers. He said reasons like that are why teachers with master\u2019s degrees should be of high value to any school system.\n\u201cFor someone without that extra education or preparation, it can get very easy to just give up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you need the veterans around just to keep morale up on staff. You gotta keep those people around.\u201d\nDr. Thurman Bridges, a professor in the School of Education and Urban Studies at Morgan State University, agrees.\n\u201cIn Baltimore City and other struggling districts, there is a huge benefit to having (master\u2019s degree) teachers that have been there a while,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey have valuable relationships with the students, parents and have built that trust within the community.\u201d\nCapital News Service reporters Lyna Bentahar, Mythili Devarakonda and Abigail Zimmardi contributed to this story.\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled Cristina Duncan Evans.",

    "summary": "Bishop Walsh School in Cumberland, Maryland, faced closure due to declining enrollment but revived its future by establishing an elite boys\u2019 basketball team. This strategic move stabilized enrollment and transformed the school\u2019s reputation, making it a competitive force in national basketball.",
    "content": "One of the smallest Catholic schools in Maryland was fighting to keep its doors open.\nAt Bishop Walsh School in Cumberland, enrollment had fallen sharply over several years. And despite the support of a passionate and close-knit community, the future of the K-12 school looked bleak.\n\u201cThe school was going to close. We were in the last year of the school,\u201d said Joseph Carter, president of Bishop Walsh.\nBishop Walsh needed a rescue plan. The one that officials landed on was unexpected for a school that rarely distinguished itself in sports: It built an elite boys\u2019 basketball team.\nFour years later, there is no talk of closing Bishop Walsh.\nEnrollment has stabilized at approximately 330 students, principal Jennifer Flinn said. The high school level in particular has seen an increase in enrollment, boosted by the basketball players who have transferred to the school, according to Flinn.\nAnd the school has a basketball team to be proud of. It\u2019s the best in school history. And it aspires to be one of the best in the country.\n\nBuilding an elite basketball program\nThe school campus is located at the end of Bishop Walsh Road on a ridge overlooking downtown Cumberland, a once prosperous coal-mining and transportation hub.\nThe glory days of the \u201cQueen City\u2019 came in the first half of the 20th century. When Franklin Roosevelt was president, Cumberland\u2019s population was nearly 40,000. Today, it numbers less than 20,000.\nBishop Walsh opened in 1966, when five small high schools in the area merged. For many years, the school grew. A middle school was added in 1985, then an elementary school followed about twenty years ago. In recent years, though, enrollment had slipped, and concerns about the future grew urgent.\nWhile some Bishop Walsh officials said the decline had not reached a crisis, Carter recalled pressing concern: \u201cWe had to do something to get students in the building.\u201d\n(Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nSo the school brought in Dan Prete. A well-known high school coach. Prete had experienced big-time sports as associate head varsity coach at Montrose Christian School in Rockville. During his time at Montrose Christian, from 2001-2013, Prete and other coaches sent 36 players to NCAA Division I schools, including NBA star Kevin Durant.\n\n\u201cWe had to do something to get students in the building.\u201d\n\u2014Joseph Carter, Bishop Walsh president\n\nWhen Prete arrived at Bishop Walsh in 2018, few at the school could imagine a basketball team that would play against future pro basketball stars and recruit players from all over the world. But that was Prete\u2019s vision.\n\u201cThe school fell on some tough times, like a lot of schools in this area did [because] of the economy,\u201d Prete said. \u201cBut there\u2019s passionate people here that always wanted something more.\u201d\nPrete brought an international flair to recruiting. He has traveled internationally to coach basketball camps twice, to Morocco in 2013 and to Brazil in 2019, and he maintains an international network of coaching contacts.\nBishop Walsh guard Vilius Slanina hails from Lithuania, and he ended up at the school through one of Prete\u2019s connections.\n\u201cI moved to the United States in August [2021], two weeks before the start of school,\u201d Slanina said.\nThe 2021-22 roster featured several other international players, including Maor Nekrashevich from Israel and Myles Hosten from the United Kingdom. The international students live in a dormitory with the rest of their teammates and several other Bishop Walsh students.\nThe international players were drawn to Bishop Walsh because of Prete, but also because of where Prete brought Bishop Walsh: To the National Interscholastic Basketball Conference.\n(Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nCompeting against the best of the best\nLed by Prete, the Spartans joined the NIBC, a new scholastic super conference.\nBefore joining the NIBC, the Spartans\u2019 boys basketball team was good and sometimes very good in a schedule filled with local competition. Players grew up in the area. Few went on to play college basketball in Division I schools of the NCAA. The squad rarely was recognized beyond its hometown.\nIn their new conference, the Spartans play in arguably the most competitive league of private high schools in the country. Their opponents include powerhouses such as IMG Academy and Montverde Academy in Florida and Oak Hill Academy in Virginia. All NIBC games are shown on ESPN networks.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cHigh Stakes Hoops\u201d ]\nThe NIBC formed in May 2021, a collaboration of ESPN and Paragon Sports Marketing, whose president, Rashid Ghazi, is a pioneer in putting high school games on TV.\nThe first five teams to join the NIBC were Montverde, Oak Hill, La Lumiere School, Sunrise Christian Academy and Legacy School \u2014 all teams with histories of success on the court. Montverde has featured top draft picks including NBA stars Ben Simmons, R.J. Barrett, D\u2019Angelo Russell and Cade Cunningham.\nThat pipeline of court talent has continued since the launch of the NIBC. In 2021, there were nine McDonald\u2019s All-Americans across the eight teams that joined the conference.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the best of the best night in and night out,\u201d Bishop Walsh assistant basketball coach Lafayette Dublin said. \u201cThere are no nights off.\u201d\nWhile Bishop Walsh\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not match some of the other schools in the conference, Prete\u2019s coaching reputation and relationships with league officials were the points that got the Spartans invited to the party.\nThe move to the NIBC attracted more eyes to Bishop Walsh\u2019s basketball program and to the school. For the first time, alums from Cumberland and across the country were watching their team on their smartphones and TVs.\nOut of the 38 NIBC games in the inaugural 2021-22 season, seven were nationally televised on ESPNU while the remaining 31 were streamed on ESPN+. Eight of Bishop Walsh\u2019s games were streamed on ESPN+ while the Spartans\u2019 game against Sunrise Christian was on ESPNU.\nIn the first NIBC season, the level of competition clearly challenged Bishop Walsh. The Spartans finished 1-9 against NIBC teams. Their only win came against Wasatch Academy.\nStill, the slow start was not unexpected by NIBC officials.\n\u201cWe\u2026 recognize that every team\u2019s not going to be Montverde, IMG or Sunrise,\u201d Ghazi said. \u201cThere will be teams that are in the middle, teams at the bottom and teams at the top, and sometimes those middle or bottom teams may have a great year.\n\u201cI think Bishop Walsh is in a great position to continue in the league for a long time. We just have to see how they do over the next two or three years,\u201d he said.\nMaking their mark\nThe season ended on a high note at the Alhambra Catholic Invitational Tournament (ACIT), a local basketball tournament started in 1961. In more than 50 years playing in the ACIT, Bishop Walsh never had won more than one game out of the three played by each team in the tournament in a single year.\nThe Spartans rewrote history.\nWhile they lost their first game to national powerhouse DeMatha, they beat Bishop McNamara at the buzzer in the first round of the consolation bracket. Cumberland native Mikey Allen hit a 3-pointer as time expired to seal the win.\nIn the championship of the consolation bracket, Bishop Walsh again won at the buzzer, again on a 3-pointer by Allen.\n\n\u23f0 GAME WINNING 3 AT THE BUZZER FOR MIKEY ALLEN!!! \u23f0\nFor the second day in a row, @mikeyallen18 is @BWSpartansHoops hero with a DEEP 3 \ud83c\udfaf as time expires.

    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Gov-elect Wes Moore, D, has a laundry list of plans for Maryland.\nMoore wants to give students an option to complete a year of paid service after high school, raise the minimum wage to $15 this year instead of the scheduled increase in 2025 and support small businesses through modernizing the regulation process. \nOne of his focuses, which he discussed repeatedly during his campaign, is to provide free pre-kindergarten for all of the state\u2019s three- and four- year olds in need. \nThe state\u2019s Blueprint Plan promises to expand free pre-K to all children in need in the next 10 years. Passed in 2021 and beginning in 2023, the plan promises to increase education funding by $3.8 billion each year for the next 10 years. \nMoore says it needs to happen sooner.\n\u201cOur children cannot wait 10-plus years for the plan\u2019s full implementation,\u201d Moore said in his \u2018Cradle to Career\u2019 education plan on his website.  \nMany states, including Maryland, have already launched programs or are in the process of doing so. \nExperts and academicians say there are numerous benefits to expanding pre-K access.\n\u201cUniversal programs are the only ones that ensure all children, especially the most disadvantaged, actually access quality programs,\u201d said Steven Barnett, senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research, an organization considered the lead expert on early childhood education. \n\u201cMany children not in poverty gain from pre-K as well, even if they gain less than those who are more disadvantaged.\u201d\nDoug Lent is communications director for the Maryland Family Network, a non-profit that advocates for quality childcare for children from birth to age five.\nLent said expanded pre-K would provide families with two benefits while also reducing societal poverty.\n\u201cIt would give parents access to childcare who could not normally afford that childcare, which means parents can go to work while kids are\u2026also receiving the skills that they need to then later on go into the workforce or into education,\u201d he said.\nIn Baltimore City, free pre-K builds on the teaching relationship between parents and their children, said Crystal Francis, director of Early Learning for Baltimore City schools.\n\u201cOur parents are a child\u2019s first teacher,\u201d Francis said. \u201cSo we always want to make sure that we are just kind of opening up and sharing experiences that our kids are having, and supporting families with what they can do at home. You know, we don\u2019t want families to feel like they are not a part of the learning that happens here.\u201d \nExperts say pre-K is important because by age five, 90% of the brain is developed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hyperbole to say that it is one of the most important decisions that a parent will ever make for their child,\u201d Lent said. \u201cThe first five years of a child\u2019s life quite literally set the stage for everything that comes after.\u201d \nBerol Dewdney teaches pre-K at Commodore John Rogers Elementary and Middle School in Baltimore. Dewdney is also the 2022-2023 Maryland teacher of the year.\nOn a sunny, but cold Tuesday morning, Dewdney\u2019s students start their day reciting affirmations, some greet her with a hug and all commit to help keep the classroom safe before learning begins. A fall-themed countdown timer plays in the background and helps students learn time management as they play with blocks and toys while their teacher finishes setting up for the day. \nDewdney said she focuses her classroom on brain-based learning \u2013 learning that teaches children to plan, focus attention, juggle multiple tasks and to memorize.\nStudents in the classroom can be seen moving between small groups, creating play plans and putting those plans into motion by using toys set up in the classroom. \nBefore the day begins, Dewdney talks with a student, part of a process in which the class can be found playing with blocks and speaking with peers.(Shannon Clark/Capital News Service)\n\u201cPlay is often thought of as this sort of cute thing, but it\u2019s not just cute,\u201d Dewdney said. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s the language of kids, and they are the experts. So, we believe in using a play-based curriculum.\u201d \nDewdney said she has seen the benefit of having accessible pre-K transcend beyond the classroom.\n\u201cStudents love learning,\u201d she said. \u201cThey love coming to school, but they feel empowered to take that learning wherever they go.\u201d\nBut the primary question regarding expanded pre-K for Moore and state legislators will be the issue of cost and how to pay for it.\nLent said there is no simple answer to estimating the cost of implementing universal pre-K, due to different factors on how to pay for it.\nAs of last September, 27,767 students were enrolled in free pre-K in Maryland. In 2021, Maryland spent over $7,414 on each child enrolled, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research.\nGeorgia became the first state to launch universal free pre-K. It started as a pilot program in 1992. It provides free voluntary pre-K to all of the state\u2019s four-year-olds. \nAround 72,000 children are currently enrolled, according to Susan Adams, deputy commissioner for pre-K and Institutional Support for the Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning.  \nDuring a typical day, Georgia pre-kindergarteners can be found participating in small group activities, playing with other children outside or learning in a classroom setting, Adams said.\nThe program has multiple benefits, she said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get families that are going to benefit from it because we have an enriching environment for children to participate in while they go to work or school,\u201d she said. \nEvery state but Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire and South Dakota have some form of free pre-K, either in development or operation, according to a NIEER 2021 research study. Wyoming and Indiana were also listed, but Indiana now offers grants to low-income families to pay for pre-K and a rural preschool in Wyoming in April 2022 received a community foundation grant for free classes. \nSome states like Georgia, rely on the state\u2019s lottery to fund their pre-K programs. Georgia\u2019s program received $400 million for the 2022-2023 school year from the state\u2019s lottery, Adams said, an amount equivalent to the pre-K budget.\nAlabama\u2019s First Class Pre-K program is funded through the state\u2019s education budget, which this year allocated around $174 million towards the program, said Barbara J. Cooper, secretary of the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education. \nMoore has said he will pay for Maryland\u2019s expanded pre-K program through taxes on revenue from \u201ccannabis, sports betting and record income tax revenue.\u201d Additionally, he said, he would use money in \u201ccapital from the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure bill,\u201d two federal programs Congress passed last year to help states with a variety of projects.\nImplementing free pre-K comes with a suggested list of national standards by NIEER that school systems have adopted as a trademark of a high quality program. Cooper in Alabama proudly proclaims that her state\u2019s program has met the standards for the last 16 years.  \nThe institute\u2019s guidelines include requiring all pre-K teachers to have a bachelor\u2019s degree, classes be capped at 20 students and schools have a \u201ccomprehensive, aligned, supported and culturally sensitive curriculum.\u201d \nThe National Institute for Early Education Research\u2019s ten standards for high quality pre-Kindergarten. (Courtesy of the National Institute for Early Education Research)\nBowie, Maryland, has a free pre-K program that it launched in 2020 after receiving a $400,000 grant from the state education department. The program, which continues to be state-funded, started at Reid Temple Christian Academy for children in Prince George\u2019s County, which already had a private pre-K program. \nBrenda Bethea, interim head of school, said Reid Temple applied to host the program at the request of the city\u2019s mayor, Tim Adams.  \n\u201c(The city was) very interested in seeing the same results that all of our children here at the academy show at any given time,\u201d Bethea said. \nThe academy\u2019s private and free programs represent the challenge for Moore and state educators as they expand the state\u2019s existing program.\nBethea said she feels the state-financed program\u2019s curriculum is inferior to that of the school\u2019s tuition-based program. \nThe tuition-based program uses Wonders curriculum, along with additional resources to \u201cmove children forward\u201d developmentally, Bethea said.  \nThe free program has many of the NIEER requirements, all teachers must be state-certified, the program must use state prescribed curriculum and 20 spots are allotted per classroom.\nIts teachers use Connect4Learning, a curriculum that Bethea calls a \u201cwatered down early childhood program.\u201d  \n\u201cIt is mediocre,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is much needed, but it is a mediocre product that has been offered to children.\u201d \nBack in Baltimore, Dewdney advises state officials to be mindful as they implement the expanded program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very pivotal moment in Maryland, but also in our country,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy around pre-K, but there is a difference between honoring and knowing that early childhood and high quality early childhood education matters and making that happen.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The number of books people tried to ban from schools and libraries nearly tripled between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the American Library Association.\u00a0\nThe ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom tracked 729 challenges to 1,597 separate book titles in 2021. That\u2019s up from 377 challenges to 566 book titles in 2019.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that I\u2019ve never witnessed in the two decades I\u2019ve worked for the Office for Intellectual Freedom and a real change in the nature of the demands to censor books,\u201d said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the organization.\nIn 2021, the ten most commonly banned books according to the ALA were Gender Queer, Lawn Boy, All Boys Aren\u2019t Blue, Out of Darkness, The Hate U Give, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Bluest Eye, This Book is Gay and Beyond Magenta.\nBook banning is not a new idea. In fact, Banned Books Week\u2014which promotes book titles targeted over the decades\u2014has been celebrated in libraries since 1982.\u00a0\n \nMost Banned Books By Year by Jonathan Hunter Donville\nBut the scope of efforts to ban books is new. Caldwell-Stone attributes the rise in book banning to advocacy groups calling for the removal of dozens of books at the same time.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to clarify that it\u2019s entirely appropriate for a parent to raise a concern about a book their student is reading and have discussions about that with librarians or teachers and even making a choice that the book isn\u2019t the right book for their child or their student,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing now is advocacy groups going to school boards and library boards with a list of 10, 25 or even 50 books, demanding their removal all at once, often based on claims that the books are either inappropriate because they reference LGBTQ persons, or reflect the lives and experiences of Black persons or persons of color.\u201d\nGroups like Moms for Liberty and No Left Turn in Education have been vigorous advocates for book removal. The groups have ties to conservative groups and donors.\u00a0\n\u201cUnfortunately, what we have found is that there is obscene graphic sexual content in books that are located in public school libraries across the United States of America,\u201d said Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAmerican parents are very concerned about the fact that their children have access to pornography in school, that it\u2019s being done under the supervision of adults who are okay with children having access to pornography in schools, and so we have gotten involved to ensure that school districts follow the law because apparently they are unable to do that on their own,\u201d she said.\nJustice declined to enumerate books Moms for Liberty disapproves of.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for a national organization to put out a list because we don\u2019t want parents to think that every book is in every single library,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to go and do the work to find what books are in their libraries, and what books and what the laws and statutes are in their state.\u201d\u00a0\nPEN America, a nonprofit that says it works to celebrate and defend free expression, identified at least 50 organizations pushing for book removals across the country.\u00a0\n[Book banning resonates as an issue in Maryland school board races]\n\u201cPreviously, you might have somebody objecting to a particular book because of a particular slur or offensive statement, or representation or content with something people don\u2019t like, but now we have this mass list of books or people going to databases and looking up with any book that has any LGBTQ content, or any book that touches on the history or contemporary commentary about racism,\u201d said Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education programs at PEN America. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an escalation of book banning, culminating in something that is really different from the banning we saw even five years ago.\u201d\nThe book challenges have been effective: According to data from Northeastern University, 15 states have passed legislation banning certain books in K-12 education, often on the grounds that they contain elements of critical race theory. An additional 16 states have proposed similar legislation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the distressing thing about this time,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing elected officials adopt the rhetoric that books dealing with race, racism and slavery are inappropriate for young people to read, or if they are available, can only reflect certain viewpoints\u2014a certain view of history that the elected officials and the advocacy groups approve of. And we\u2019re seeing elected officials also adopt the rhetoric that books dealing with gay, queer or transgender people are inappropriate for young people to read and demanding that such books be removed from schools and libraries.\u201d\u00a0\nPEN America found that about half of challenged books are intended for young adult readers, but they also include picture books intended for elementary schoolers.\u00a0\nBooks like Heather Has Two Mommies, This Day in June \u2014 a picture book about Pride parades \u2014 and Anti-Racist Baby have all been challenged or banned. The organization also found that 41% of banned books \u201cexplicitly address LGBTQ+ themes or have protagonists or prominent secondary characters who are LGBTQ+.\u201d\u00a0\nJustice says that the idea that the book challenge fight is about LGBTQ issues is a lie.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear about saying that parents being concerned about pornography in schools whether it\u2019s with heterosexual couples, homosexual couples, heterosexual children, homosexual children, their sexual orientation isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pornography. That\u2019s the issue and we need to be honest about that.\u201d\nCaldwell-Stone worries about this trend from both a legal and moral standpoint.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about public institutions, government-funded institutions, engaged in telling young people and telling families and telling adults what they can read and think about, which is repugnant to the First Amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a matter of addressing the dignity and humanity of others who live in society and their right to find their lives and experiences. reflected in the collections of a public library or school library that their taxes support as well.\u201d\u00a0\nFriedman agreed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s having an impact for students, teachers, writers, publishers and librarians, some of whom have been harassed or intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly concerning because if you start reducing the availability of books based on anything anyone might object to, you\u2019re very quickly going to run out of any kind of library or classroom book to have available to young people.\u201d\nCaldwell-Stone said she anticipates the number of challenged books this year will be about the same or higher than last year.\n\u201cThe end result is that books that do reflect the diversity of society, that reflect the lives of persons who attend that school or part of the community and that the public library serves, are being told that they don\u2019t belong and that their stories don\u2019t belong,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that is the ultimate tragedy here.\u201d",

The gap between white and Hispanic students' scores has widened over the past two decades, reflecting increased disparities in educational outcomes.",
    "content": "Maryland school test scores reflected a national decline in learning, according to newly released data from national tests known as the \u201cnation\u2019s report card.\u201d\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests are administered yearly to students across the country. The latest test was the first given since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fourth-grade and eighth-grade students across the country took the reading and math exams.\nMaryland\u2019s results give insight into the extent of learning loss in the state during the pandemic.\n\u00a0\nBaltimore City saw decreases in every test, except in eighth-grade reading\nBaltimore City participates in the NAEP\u2019s Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA), which is designed to measure educational outcomes in urban school districts, according to the organization\u2019s website.\u00a0\nThe school district experienced a 15-point decrease in average fourth-grade math scores from 2019 (218 to 203), tied with Cleveland for the largest decline among the 26 districts participating in the TUDA. The score to reach the NAEP Basic level\u2014 the lowest of the NAEP test\u2014 is 214.\nEighth-grade reading test scores were the only exception, holding at 241. Baltimore City was one of the few jurisdictions in the TUDA that didn\u2019t experience a decline in eighth-grade reading scores, along with Clark County in Nevada and Miami-Dade and Duval counties in Florida.\n\n\u00a0\nThe gap between scores for white and Hispanic students has grown in the past couple of years\nThe average score for Maryland fourth-grade Hispanic students in reading was 40 points lower than that for white students in 2022. In 1998, this performance gap was 18 points. The average score for Maryland Hispanic eighth-graders in reading was 30 points lower than their white counterparts in 2022, compared to 11 points in 1998.\nThis trend also persisted in math scores.\nThis year Hispanic fourth-graders in Maryland had an average math score 37 points lower than white students, compared to 20 points in 2000. Hispanic eighth-graders scored 39 points lower than white students in math, compared to 23 points in 2000.\n\n\u00a0\nRural students outperformed other students based on location\nThe NAEP assigns districts into one of four location types: city, suburban, rural, and town. On average, rural students outperformed students in the other location types.\u00a0\nFor fourth-graders, the average math score for rural students was higher than the lowest average city students by 20 points. In reading, rural students scored higher than city students by 22 points on average. Rural students were also the other location category that saw an increase in reading scores for this demographic.\nRural eighth-graders in the state scored higher on the reading exams than the lowest performing group, suburban students, by 11 points. City and suburban eighth-graders both had the same average math score this year. Rural students scored better than both groups by 14 points.\n\n\u00a0\nMaryland scored in the middle of the pack nationally\nIn 2022, the average score in Maryland (259) was lower than those in 7 jurisdictions, higher than those in 9 jurisdictions and not significantly different from those in 35 jurisdictions.\nThe state performed the best compared to other states in eighth-grade reading and lagged behind in fourth-grade math. The average fourth-grade math score of 229 was lower than 35 other jurisdictions.",

In April 2011, a federal lien was filed against him in the amount of $44,691.54. Another federal tax lien was filed against him in April the year after in the amount of $11,245.85. There was no evidence in the court records about how or whether those liens were satisfied.\nMontgomery had both a state and federal tax lien filed against him in June 2015. On June 24, 2015, a state lien was filed in the amount of $3,328.54, and it has been satisfied. On June 30, 2015, a federal lien was filed for $12,296.57, and it was settled in July 2022.\nMontgomery did not reply to requests for comment on these liens.\nYonelle Moore Lee, who is running for the District 4 seat, has had three liens filed against her, each in a different Maryland county.\u00a0\nThe first was filed in the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court in December 2004 in the amount of $8,353.02. The second, which was filed in the Montgomery County Circuit Court in January 2005, was in the amount of $23,225.68. The two previously stated liens were settled in 2013. The final and most recent lien, in the amount of $1,079.41, was a state tax lien filed in April 2014 in Charles County Circuit Court and satisfied in February 2015. Lee did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\nJulie Brown, who is running for the District 2 seat, shares an address in Indian Head and a birthday with a Julie Lee Melton, who had $13,774.19 in state tax liens filed against her at that address on Jan. 25, 2022. Brown denied going by the name Julie Lee Melton and said: \u201cI don\u2019t have tax liens,\u201d but said Melton is her daughter\u2019s maiden name.\nThe liens were divided into four subsets: $2,402.87, $5,008.73, $4,879.62 and $1,482.97. The case was closed, but it is unclear whether Melton has paid.\nMontgomery County:\nGrace Rivera-Oven, a District 1 candidate, and her husband Mark J. Oven had a federal lien of $106,767 filed against them on April 22, 2016. That lien was satisfied on June 2, 2021.\nThis lien is listed in the names of Mark J. Oven and G.C. Rivera-Oven. The candidate used the name Grace Rivera Oven in her campaign filing with the Board of Elections, but the candidate confirmed on her campaign website that she is married to Mark J. Oven.\nCNS emailed the candidate for comment, but has not yet received a response.\nEsther L. Wells, running for the county\u2019s District 1 seat, had a lien filed against her in Montgomery Circuit Court in January 2020 in the amount of $8,708.66. After the lien was filed, Wells said she submitted proper documentation that took several months to process due to pandemic-related slowdowns at the Maryland Comptroller\u2019s Office. The lien was then satisfied in April 2021.\nKent County:\nTracy Cameransi has had three liens filed against her. In January 2008, there was a judgment lien filed against her in the amount of $73,468.96, which was then satisfied in September 2013. There was a second judgment lien filed against her for $10,596.79 that was released in June 2015. A third lien, recorded in December 2011, was in the amount of $14,171.19.\n\u201cAny lien that we had was due to an unfortunate situation many years ago,\u201d Cameransi stated in an email. She said she worked with a public accountant, and all of the liens have been satisfied.\nAretha Dorsey has had two liens filed against her and Samuel Dorsey. The first was recorded in February 2009 in the amount of $3,268.74, and it was satisfied in March 2011. The second, filed in March 2011 in the amount of $3,740.11, was settled in February 2013. Dorsey did not answer requests for comment.\nBaltimore City:\nSalimah Jasani had one state tax lien filed against her in November 2019 for $1,302.95 that was settled shortly after in January 2020.\u00a0\nJasani said she served as a member of Americorps, an independent agency of the federal government focused on community service work. As a member, she received an education award, or scholarship, about seven years ago that was sent to the Johns Hopkins University, where she was completing a master\u2019s degree in education studies.\nBecause the award was sent directly to the university, Jasani only saw a decrease in the amount that she owed the university. However, she later heard from the IRS that she was supposed to report that funding as income when she filed her taxes.\u00a0\nAfter communication with the IRS, Jasani said that they told her she owed more taxes because of this income, so she paid it off. After the issue was resolved, Jasani received a lien notice from the state of Maryland, which was the first communication from the state on this matter. She said she settled the lien as soon as she received it.\u00a0\nApril Christina Curley said her state tax lien of $16,418.60 reflects many Baltimore families\u2019 struggles with indebtedness and poverty.\n\u201cThe reality is I\u2019m poor,\u201d she said. \u201cI am absolutely poor.\u201d\nCurley said she works two jobs and financially supports her sister, five nephews, niece and mother.\nWhile Curley said she isn\u2019t sure what she owes taxes for, she thinks the lien has to do with living in multiple states in 2018. That year, Curley transferred from Google\u2019s office in New York City to Washington, D.C., and said she was taxed in Maryland, the District and New York. She plans to address the tax lien after the election.\nAllegany County:\nLori Lepley had a state tax lien filed against her in August 2022 in the amount of $8,159.02.\nLepley said she had included a Historic District Tax Credit in her filings after her accountant had recommended it because she owns a building in Cumberland\u2019s historic downtown district, but it was denied by the state. After many attempts to reach out and appeal the decision with no success, Lepley was instead notified of a tax lien. She said she has since entered a payment arrangement to satisfy the lien.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was disappointing that the state was denying tax credits for such an important part of our historic downtown because building owners like me invest that money in continuing to improve our downtown,\u201d Lepley stated in an email response. \u201cHowever, I will abide by their decision. I am glad it is resolved, even if I did not get a satisfactory answer to my own questions.\u201d\nFrederick County:\nCindy Rose had a tax lien of $2,685.73 filed against her and Jamie Rose in April 2003 that was settled in 2005.\n\u201cThat was a long time ago. To the best of my recollection we owed some sort of tax in 2003 but couldn\u2019t afford to pay it off until 2005,\u201d Rose said in an email statement.\nWashington County:\nMichael Guessford is an incumbent of the school board. He has had both state and federal liens filed against him. A state lien, recorded in August 2001 for $4,881.96, was settled in January 2002. There was also a series of federal liens filed against him in June 2012 totaling $69,782.17. They were satisfied in July 2014. Guessford did not respond to requests for comment on these liens.\u00a0\nCNS reporter Khushboo Rathore contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "In Maryland's school board races, conservative candidates are pushing to ban books addressing LGBTQ+ issues and other sensitive topics, citing concerns over pornographic content; however, they are in the minority, with a majority of candidates opposing book bans or advocating for age-appropriate review processes.",
    "content": "Resting on the shelves of some public schools nationwide are two memoirs from LGBTQ+ authors detailing the growing pains they lived through while growing up and finding themselves.\nThose books \u2013 \u201cGender Queer\u201d and \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d \u2013 and others like them have become flash points in school board races nationwide, including in Maryland. Conservative candidates argue that drawings and passages in such books qualify as pornography.\n\u201cAny book with pornographic material should not be on school library shelves,\u201d Frederick County school board candidate Olivia Angolia said in response to a Capital News Service survey of the state\u2019s school board candidates.\u00a0 \u201cThere needs to be a vigorous process to review library books that are already adopted, and any prospective books.\u201d\nBut Rae Gallagher, one of Angolia\u2019s opponents, offers a different take.\n\u201cI am not in favor of banning books within FCPS,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cThe primary purpose of our public education system is to expose students to a variety of resources, perspectives and experiences to help them develop critical thinking skills and teach them how to think for themselves.\u201d\nDisagreements like the one between Angolia and Gallagher can be found in school board races across the state. Conservative school board candidates who want to remove books dealing with gender identity, racism and other socially sensitive topics from school library shelves are running in at least 11 of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties, according to a Capital News Service survey of the candidates.\u00a0\nBut those socially conservative school board candidates are in the minority. About 25% of the 102 candidates who responded to the CNS survey said they favor banning some controversial books from school libraries \u2013 but about 41% opposed doing so. Meanwhile, about 30% chose a middle path, saying they trust the review process that screens books, or that they think that age should be a factor when deciding what is allowed in schools.\nThe scope of the debate\nSome of the books that are prompting the debate in Maryland and beyond are quite different from what your grandparents would borrow from their high school libraries.\u00a0\n\u201cGender Queer\u201d is a graphic novel by nonbinary author Maia Kobabe about finding one\u2019s gender identity and experiencing sex for the first time.\u00a0 \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d is the story of a queer Black kid, George M. Johnson, who describes their first intimate sexual experience after being assaulted by classmates in a high school bathroom.\nHundreds of schools have already banned either one or both of the books. Maryland\u2019s Wicomico County school board took action against \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue.\u201d\n\u201cWe found two copies in two high school libraries and removed them. We had no objections about their removal,\u201d said Ann Brittingham Suthowski, who is running for reelection in the county\u2019s District 4.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\n\u201cGender Queer\u201d and \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d are among the most banned books in the country, according to The New York Times and \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d author Johnson\u2019s website.\nHowever, the American Library Association this year released a survey that said 71% of voters are against any sort of book banning. The CNS survey shows plenty of Maryland candidates are against it, too.\n\u201cNo education has ever been furthered due to the banning of a book,\u201d said Emily Jackson, a Talbot County candidate.\n\u2018Education Not Indoctrination\u2019\nIn addition to voicing concerns about books with sexual content, conservative candidates complain about \u201cindoctrination\u201d in books that, they say, promote critical race theory: a college-level academic theory that examines the impact racism has had on American history, laws and policies.\nIn Frederick County, three board candidates \u2013 Angolia, Nancy Allen and Cindy Rose \u2013 are running together as the \u201cEducation Not Indoctrination\u201d slate. The 1776 Action PAC, a conservative group backing like-minded school board candidates nationwide, is backing the right-wing slate in Frederick County, as is Dan Cox, the Republican candidate for governor.\nRose said at an Oct. 14 school board meeting that she wants to ban 35 books from schools, the Frederick News-Post reported. The list, which can be found here, includes Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s anti-war classic \u201cSlaughterhouse Five\u201d and \u201cJesus Land: A Memoir,\u201d which details growing up in an interracial family, as well as several books with LGBTQ+ themes.\nThe conservative candidates object to \u201cGender Queer\u201d because it includes a drawing of an older man and a younger man with their legs intertwined, along with a drawing of two young males engaged in a sexual act.\n\u201cWe recently got \u2018Gender Queer\u2019 removed from one of our school libraries. It\u2019s not just vulgar, it meets the federal definition of \u2018pornography,\u2019 \u201d Rose said.\nStatewide, only 6.79% of school board candidate survey respondents mentioned LGBTQ+ content or one of the books \u2013 but 29.13% of candidates were concerned about sexually explicit literature.\nWorcester County candidate Katie Addis said such books have no place in school libraries..\u00a0\n\u201cMost of these books in question are meant for \u2018young adults.\u2019 I believe a young adult is someone 18-22 years old no longer enrolled in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no \u2018young adults\u2019 enrolled at school, only minors.\u201d\n\u2018Regressive, myopic and detrimental\u2019\nCandidates like those on the Education Not Indoctrination slate have prompted a backlash, both from progressive activists and candidates who say that such conservative candidates want to take schools back in time.\nIn Baltimore and Frederick counties, the Marylanders for Freedom and Opportunity PAC has launched an ad series pushing back on candidates with \u201cdivisive, dangerous platforms.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOlivia Angolia, Nancy Allen, and Cindy Rose are pushing to censor our teachers and politicize our children\u2019s education. Don\u2019t let them take us in the wrong direction,\u201d the ad says.\nThat concern about removing school library materials is shared by many candidates across the counties, including Jonathan Briggs, a candidate from Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s District 2. \n\u201cI am a firm believer that any book that challenges a student\u2019s perspective is a good opportunity for them to ask questions and investigate the subject matter further to become more knowledgeable about it,\u201d Briggs said.\nSome candidates even said book banning is a blatant form of censorship.\n\u00a0\u201cBanning books is regressive, myopic and detrimental to society as well,\u201d said Leonard Arvi], a candidate in Wicomico County\u2019s District 3. \u201cBanning books is a fascism and has no place in democratic, open society.\u201d\n\u00a0A middle way\nOther candidates offered a more nuanced approach to selecting or rejecting school library materials.\nSeveral candidates surveyed said that school library books should be age-appropriate, as determined by the media specialists the district employs. Many candidates referred to either the Maryland Library Blueprint or the American Association of School Libraries, both of which have guidelines regarding which books should be included in a public school\u2019s library system.\nThe Maryland School Library Media Standards for Learners, Librarians and Libraries, from the Maryland Library Blueprint, does not explicitly state age minimums for certain genres or contents of books. Instead, the focus is on the overall curiosity and education level of the student.\nStill, several candidates said that what\u2019s right for older students may not be right for younger students.\n\u201cI never endorse banning books or free speech,\u201d said Steve Whisler, a board candidate in Carroll County. \u201cThat said, I do firmly believe that we should limit student access to books that parents and educators deem not age-appropriate.\u201d\nIn most counties, a book can be challenged by a parent or community member and it will be reviewed by the Board of Education. That\u2019s exactly what happens in Montgomery County.\n\u201cIn the event that a parent or staff question the appropriateness of a book, an ad hoc evaluation committee is convened to reevaluate materials whose appropriateness has been questioned,\u201d said Karla Silvestre , an incumbent at-large board member running for reelection in Montgomery County.\nBut that evaluation process should not strictly limit the kinds of books that students can read, said Jane E. Lichter, a board candidate in Baltimore County\u2019s District 2.\n\u201cIt is critical that books are available for students to read about the world in which they live, as well as books that help students understand lives that are different than their own,\u201d Lichter said.\nCNS reporters Danielle Hodes and Jenna Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School partnered Thursday with K-12 schools across southern Maryland to host a question and answer session with astronauts aboard the International Space Station.\u00a0\nAstronauts Nicole A. Mann, Frank Rubio, and Josh Cassada of the Expedition 68 Space Station Crew participated live in the space-to-earth downlink call, aired on NASA Television.\u00a0\nTest pilots under instruction and students from seven Maryland schools pre-recorded videos at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, asking a variety of questions of the astronauts.\nLt. Erin Loft, a test pilot student, asked about the hardest part of adapting to microgravity conditions aboard the ISS, and Mann, the first Native American woman in space, showed off the strips of velcro sewn onto the astronaut\u2019s pants.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can imagine, you\u2019re such a mess when you\u2019re trying to get something done,\u201d Mann said, because the air flow and microgravity inside the station makes tools float away.\nThe astronauts gave Mann\u2019s niece, Brooklyn, a glimpse of daily life on the ISS, where Mann said the day starts with breakfast at 6 a.m. before an \u201cincredibly packed, but very rewarding\u201d 12 hours of work, including maintenance of the station and the science experiments aboard.\n\u201cNo day is like any other day, we get to do lots of different jobs. Sometimes we get to play chief medical officer, sometimes we get to play plumber or electrician, but above all things we get to play scientist,\u201d Rubio said.\nCrew members monitor space station research experiments from a wide range of disciplines. A third grade student at Leonardtown Elementary School asked what experiments the astronauts are most excited to work on in space.\nOn Expedition 68, Rubio said, there are efforts underway to develop organs in space, and to grow tomato plants.\u00a0\nRubio, who launched on the Russian Soyuz MS-22 last month, said he recently harvested the first tomato grown in space. Lt. Jordan Hernandez asked how involved the astronauts are in decision making with the experiments.\n\u201cUp here, we kind of find ourselves in the role of a grad student,\u201d Cassada said. Crew members follow guidance from scientists on the ground to further the experiments, but also lend their own insights from space.\nThe skills that Mann learned at test pilot school are \u201c100% applicable everyday,\u201d she told student Connor, because the astronauts have to be adaptable and learn quickly in order to execute their tasks and communicate results.\nCmdr. Jeremy DeBons, commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, said that nearly 100 graduates of the school have gone on to become NASA astronauts.\nBoth Mann and Cassada are graduates of the school, and served as test pilots in the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy before joining the expedition.\nIn their limited free time, Cassada said the crew enjoys playing with their meals in microgravity, making calls back to Earth to keep up with their families, and sneaking peeks out of the station windows.\u00a0\n\u201cLooking out that window, at Earth and looking at that atmosphere, you realize how lucky we are to live on planet Earth. It is quite a place and we need to protect it,\u201d Cassada said.\nIn addition to the test pilot school, the Maryland schools participating in the call were Leonardtown Elementary School, Hollywood Elementary School, Town Creek Elementary School in Lexington Park, Evergreen Elementary School in California, Dowell Elementary School in Lusby, and the Chesapeake Charter School and Esperanza Middle School, both in Lexington Park.",

    "summary": "Despite widespread deployment and support from school board candidates, there is no empirical evidence that school resource officers enhance safety in Maryland schools. Candidates also emphasized the need for improved mental health services to address school safety concerns.",
    "content": "Amid nationwide concern about school shootings and other violent incidents, all 24 Maryland school districts have employed school resource officers at some time since the 2016-2017 school year, and all but one retain them still.\nBut now, at least five years on, the state says it has no proof that resource officers make schools safer.\u00a0\n\u201cIn Maryland, we have no data on whether or not actual school resource officers are effective (or) work or don\u2019t work,\u201d said Michael Rudinski, regional training and certification specialist for the Maryland Center for School Safety.\nEven so, in a recent survey conducted by the Capital News Service, 34 school board candidates across the state cited school resource officers as the key to school safety. All 102 candidates who participated agreed that school safety is a problem that needs to be addressed, and many candidates suggested increased access to mental health services as another possible solution.\nThe survey also asked the candidates what the most important issue facing their school board is. Ten responded with school safety. The only issues that ranked more often as most important were pandemic-related learning loss, overall academic performance and the teacher shortage.\nSchool resource officers\nRudinski explained that before the state\u2019s Safe to Learn Act of 2018, there was no real definition of resource officers. The act defines school resource officers as law enforcement officers who have \u201ca memorandum of understanding between a local law enforcement agency and a local school system\u201d or who belong to the Baltimore City School Police Department.\nUnder the Safe to Learn Act, Rudinski\u2019s office at the State Department of Education had trained all school resource officers across the state by Sept. 1, 2019. The Maryland Center for School Safety trains officers to handle sensitive school situations, but school boards may put their own alternative training in place.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\nNot long after all that training concluded, though, the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered the schools. Rudinski said that\u2019s prevented his office from doing any long-term evaluation of how effective school resource officers really are.\nSchool resource officers remain valuable despite the lack of data about their effectiveness, according to Christopher Fraley, Region 2 director for the National Association of School Resource Officers.\u00a0\nHe stressed, though, that resource officers are located in schools to prevent trouble, but not to punish individual students.\n\u201cOne of the biggest things I think that sometimes comes into confusion is that SROs should not be used for disciplinary reasons,\u201d said Fraley, an Allegany County resident whose wife, Tammy Fraley, serves on Allegany County\u2019s Board of Education.\nSROs and the candidates\nSchool board candidates from across the state frequently mentioned school resource officers as the best way to keep schools safe. But those school cops do different things in different places, prompting some candidates to express concerns about how those officers are being used.\nA Baltimore County District 4 candidate, Samay Kindra, said he was concerned that the county leads the state in arrests by resource officers.\n\u201cThis highlights the problem of unclear delineation between situations where law enforcement intervention is appropriate and where school-based administrative procedures are appropriate,\u201d Kindra said.\nHoward County candidate Linfeng Chen, however, said resource officers play a vital role, especially now with the national concern about school staff shortages.\n\u201cSchool resource officers are important to maintaining a safe environment for students to learn,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt makes sense to have SROs now more than ever if we consider staff shortages and increased school fighting and acting out issues.\u201d\u00a0\nMontgomery County stationed officers in schools beginning in 2002, prompted by the Columbine High School shootings in 1999, but in 2021 \u2013 amid criticism that students of color were disproportionately subjected to discipline from SROs \u2013 the in-house school officer program was ended.\n\nDisparate Maryland school board candidates united on teacher shortage concerns\n\nNow Montgomery County has another form of school resource officers called community engagement officers. The engagement officers are not permanently stationed inside schools, but schools can make requests for them to come to schools when needed.\nBut some Montgomery board candidates suggested that may not be enough. Scott Joftus, an incumbent board member running for re-election in District 3, said more unarmed security officials may be needed in the county\u2019s schools. And Joftus\u2019 opponent, Julie Yang, also called for changes.\n\u201cRecent incidents have exposed the need to improve our schools\u2019 intercom system, training for staff on safety protocol procedures, and crisis communication with the community,\u201d Yang said.\nOther safety measures\nOther candidates stressed that school safety doesn\u2019t begin and end with school resource officers. Many board hopefuls suggested expanding access to mental health resources in the state\u2019s schools, while others suggested combining that with additional security measures.\n\u201cWe need to make sure our buildings are safe, but we also need to address the mental health crisis within our student population,\u201d said Karin Miller, a board candidate in Wicomico County\u2019s District 2. \u201cIt should not be a question of school resource officers OR social workers; they both have a role to play in creating a safe atmosphere within our schools.\u201d\u00a0\nRae Gallagher, a board candidate in Frederick County, agreed.\n\u201cSafety of school buildings is extremely important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most effective strategies to reduce school shootings include incorporating programming that addresses student mental health, training teachers and educators on recognizing signs that a student may be considering harming oneself or others, ensuring that school buildings are secure, and partnering with policymakers at the state level on common sense gun laws.\u201d\u00a0\nOther candidates stressed that school resource officers and mental health access are just parts of what should be a comprehensive approach to school safety.\n\u201cI will continue to advocate for funding for new clean energy school buildings that are built with the features of secure front entrances and modern doors and locks; improve safe walking paths to schools and advocate for a fully staffed crossing guard program; promote mitigating COVID-19 spread through a high vaccine rate; and, support budgets with increased services for bullying prevention and restorative approaches to conflict resolution,\u201d said Pamela Boozer-Strother, who is running for re-election in Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s District 3.\n\nSchool board candidates cite learning loss, student performance as biggest issues\n\nLuc Angelot, a candidate in Wicomico County\u2019s District 1, said school safety has been on his mind for half his life.\n\u201cI am very concerned about school safety,\u201d said Angelot, who\u2019s 18 years old. \u201cI was 9 years old when the Sandy Hook shooting took place. My generation grew up fearing a possible shooting happening at any moment.\u201d\nThat being the case, Angelot said, school safety has to be a top priority.\n\u201cFrom my plan to make mental health a priority to continuing to work with local law enforcement, retrofitting our buildings to be well secured, and taking social media threats seriously, we can do things to make sure students feel safe,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "summary": "Maryland's school board candidates across political spectrums agree that addressing the teacher shortage is a top priority, citing the need to recruit and retain quality teachers with higher salaries and improved working conditions. The issue is particularly pressing as an average of 10% of teachers did not return in the 2021-2022 school year, leaving many districts with significant vacancies.",
    "content": "From Maryland\u2019s western panhandle to its Eastern Shore \u2013 and from the political right to the left \u2013 Maryland\u2019s school board candidates agree that the teacher shortage is one of the key issues they will have to confront if elected.\n\u201cWe need to recruit and, especially, retain teachers and other staff,\u201d said Linda Murray, who\u2019s running in Washington County. \u201cPeople are leaving for higher-paying, less stressful jobs.\u201d\n\u201cThe greatest indicator for student success is the presence of a quality teacher in the classroom\u00a0 \u2013 this is the greatest challenge facing us in Talbot County,\u201d said Emily Jackson, an Eastern Shore candidate.\nThe nationwide post-pandemic teacher shortage is an issue throughout Maryland for a reason. The Maryland State Department of Education reported that in the 2021-2022 school year, an average of 10% of teachers did not return.\nThat statistic explains why Maryland school board candidates who replied to a Capital News Service survey largely agreed that they need to do something about the teacher shortage if elected. Many say higher teacher salaries are an obvious solution.\nA statewide dilemma\nIn Maryland and many school districts across the country, job postings for teacher positions are lengthy \u2013 and school board candidates said they worry the lists will grow longer still. Many school board candidates say teacher morale is running on empty following the COVID-19 pandemic, and pay often does not serve as motivation.\nAs of Aug. 15, almost every county reported at least one teacher vacancy. Prince George\u2019s County reported the most, at 900 vacancies. Baltimore City reported 240 vacancies.\nIn the Capital News Service survey, of the 21 Maryland counties plus Baltimore City in which candidates participated, 15 had at least one candidate that cited teacher retention/recruitment as one of the most important issues facing their school board.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\nApril Christina Curley, who\u2019s running in Baltimore City, said it is important to hire qualified educators and keep them on staff for the long term because it helps the city\u2019s students. If the district has a large number of experienced teachers, \u201cwe know that our children will reap the benefits in very tangible, measured ways,\u201d she said.\nDiane Alvarez, a candidate in Harford County\u2019s District F, said that when teachers decide to leave, it creates chaos in the classroom. To foster more stability, she said, the school board needs to improve teacher retention and figure out why teachers are leaving.\n\u201cFor me, looking for a position on the school board, that\u2019s one of the first questions I want to know,\u201d Alvarez said in an interview.\nCharles County reported 194 teacher vacancies at the end of the 2021-2022 school year, meaning that 10% of teaching positions were vacant. Four of the nine candidates from Charles County who answered the survey said the county needs to focus on teacher retention and increasing teacher salaries.\n\u201cWe need to make teachers and staff feel respected and motivated to teach and remain in Charles County,\u201d said candidate Yonelle Moore Lee.\nA variety of solutions\nWhile candidates are united in their belief that teacher retention and recruitment are problems, they offer a variety of ideas for addressing them. Some hope new state legislation will resolve them, but others have different ideas.\nThe state recently adopted the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, legislation that aims to improve the quality of education in Maryland by increasing funding $3.8 billion each year for a decade. Each Maryland county is responsible for locally implementing the policy, and the Blueprint\u2019s accountability board will oversee this process.\nThe Blueprint includes a section on teacher salaries that aims to incentivize existing teachers to remain in place. It also aims to make teacher compensation more comparable to other fields with similar education requirements.\nBy 2024, the Blueprint will initially increase teacher salaries by 10% before a minimum salary of $60,000 is required by July 1, 2026.\nAs a result, some board candidates saw the Blueprint as the be-all, end-all solution to the education issues facing the state.\n\u201cThe most important issue is the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future,\u201d said David Plotts, who is running in Wicomico County\u2019s District 4.\nYet for other candidates, the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future is not the end of the discussion on teachers\u2019 salaries. Some said that increasing salaries is the best way to retain staff, and the Blueprint only begins to address the salary issue.\nCurley, the Baltimore candidate, said school boards will have to make big-time investments to keep educators in the classroom.\n\nSchool board candidates cite learning loss, student performance as biggest issues\n\n\u201cBringing in qualified educators and working to keep them in the classroom will require a drastic and radical commitment from the school board to significantly increase the base salary for teachers with opportunities for achievable performance bonuses, offering a manageable workload with supportive administrators,\u201d she said.\nHoward County candidate Jacky McCoy said another potential solution is the \u201cgrow your own\u201d teacher program, in which schools aim to recruit current students and community members as future teachers.\nAlvarez noted that the state, in planning for the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s future, found that many teachers leave the profession after two years \u2013 \u201cwith no data as to why.\u201d\nShe said school districts need to do research to answer that question and to prevent teachers from leaving.\n\u201cInterview each teacher, administrators and staff to determine expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cEmploy expectation management (a management tool that aims to keep employers and employees in sync in terms of goals) in areas needed and monitor teacher needs in terms of resources and mental health.\u201d\nThe issue of teacher shortages transcends ideological lines. Alvarez worries that critical race theory is being taught in her county schools and that sexually explicit material should be removed from school libraries.\nAnd yet on the teacher recruitment and retention issue, she agrees with Montgomery County Board of Education Vice President Karla Silvestre, who praises the \u201canti-bias and anti-racist curriculum\u201d in the county schools and who trusts librarians to decide which books should be allowed in school libraries.\n\u00a0\u201dWe have to recruit and retain the best talent to work with our students,\u201d said Silvestre, who\u2019s running for re-election to an at-large board seat. \u201cGreat teachers and principals change lives and transform schools.\u201d\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "summary": "Despite differing views on cultural issues, many Maryland school board candidates agree that pandemic-related learning loss and academic recovery are the most pressing issues facing schools. This focus on learning loss reflects a statewide concern, impacting every child and taking precedence over social issues like critical race theory.",
    "content": "Steve Whisler and Jenni Pompi stand on opposite sides of the cultural divide roiling school board races in Maryland and nationwide. Whisler objects to what he called the \u201c1619 Project curriculum\u201d that focuses on the role of racism in America\u2019s founding, while Pompi praises schools that teach students about \u201cthe disenfranchisement and marginalization of Black, brown and indigenous people.\u201d\nBut Whisler and Pompi agree on one thing: The most important issue facing Maryland\u2019s schools isn\u2019t their approach to race or the kinds of books students can check out of school libraries.\n\u201cThe most pressing issue in our county relates to learning loss,\u201d Whisler, a Carroll County Board of Education candidate, said.\n\u201cThe most important issue facing our school board (is) student recovery from the pandemic learning gap,\u201d said Pompi, who is running for the school board in Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s District 2.\nThey are among some 102 Maryland school board candidates who responded to a Capital News Service survey on education issues \u2013 and 16 named learning loss stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic as the key issue facing schools in their district. Another 16 cited other academic performance issues as most important.\nMeanwhile, only 11 cited social issues, such as critical race theory and books about sexuality in school libraries, as the most important issues facing their schools.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\nThat may come as a surprise after tensions about critical race theory and library books erupted at school board meetings in many states last year. But the concerns about pandemic-related learning loss, and academic performance in general, come as no surprise to Susan Getty, vice president of the Maryland State Board of Education.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big issue for the candidates because it literally affected every child,\u201d Getty said in an interview.\nA statewide concern\nThe candidates\u2019 concerns about learning loss span the state as well as the political spectrum. Candidates in 10 Maryland counties, from Allegany County in Western Maryland to Wicomico County on the Eastern Shore, named learning loss as the top issue in the CNS survey.\n\u201cThe most important issue facing the school board is addressing the impact of school closures and remote learning on students\u2019 education and proficiency rates in math and reading,\u201d said Esther L. Wells, who is running for the school board in Montgomery County\u2019s District 1.\nThe focus on learning loss comes at a turning point for public education in Maryland and across the country.\nThe debates about the teaching of the nation\u2019s racial history, along with parental concerns about books about sexual identity, have energized school board races in Maryland as well as nationwide. The CNS survey responses, along with a review of the websites of candidates who did not respond to the survey, show that social conservatives are now running for board seats in at least 13 of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties.\nGiven the newfound intensity surrounding school board races, the new Local News Network at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism sent questionnaires to all 155 state school board candidates running in the Nov. 8 election for this Capital News Service project.\nCandidates were asked open-ended questions about the top education issue, the teaching of history, the removal of books from school libraries, school safety and other key matters. The candidates\u2019 answers are detailed in a voter guide published on the CNS website and available for republication by any news organization in the state.\nLearning loss and overall student performance emerged as the top issues in the survey even though it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how far behind students fell. Because of the pandemic, the State Department of Education did not release its county-by-county school report cards \u2013 its most comprehensive look at how students are learning \u2013 in 2020 or 2021.\n\u201cData on student achievement during those two years is not available to the public, and one can only guess how far our students have fallen behind,\u201d said Donna Nizolek, who is running for the school board in Talbot County\u2019s District 3.\nThe Department of Education said it plans to release test score results for the 2021-2022 school year in January. But Getty, of the State Board of Education, said a few measurements show that Maryland is following the national trend of learning loss due to the pandemic.\nAmong them is the 2021 Kindergarten Readiness Assessment, which showcased that there are more students than before the pandemic who need targeted extra support to be ready for school, Getty said. Fifth and eighth grade students also lacked proficiency in science, according to testing this year.\nNationwide, NWEA, a nonprofit school testing organization, reported that students in the 2021-2022 school year graded 5 to 10 percentile points lower in math than they would in a typical year, while grading 2 to 4 points lower in reading.\nGetty said the state is trying to address the learning loss issue by targeting students who need help the most. She said the state has received funding from the federal government for COVID-19 recovery, which is being spent on increased mental health services as well as tutoring and summer programs aimed at bridging the achievement gap.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to go back and recapture what we used to do,\u201d Getty said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to move forward and do a better job at educating the underserved students.\u201d\nWhat the candidates say\nMany school board candidates stressed, though, that pandemic-related learning loss is only part of a problem that emerged long ago.\n\u201cThe most important issue we face is the failing education system in place,\u201d said John Abbott, a social conservative running for the Board of Education in Worcester County on the Eastern Shore. \u201cHigh percentages of students in Worcester County are not proficient in math and reading.\u201d\nAbbott also expressed concerns about sexually explicit books in school libraries. But even candidates who are not making social issues central to their campaigns, such as Robin Harvey, shared Abbott\u2019s worries about what kids are learning \u2013 or not learning.\n\u201cStudent performance is the most important issue facing public education,\u201d said Harvey, who is running in Baltimore County\u2019s District 1.\nCandidates offered a wide variety of suggestions as to how schools in the state can help students perform better.\n\u201cStrategies to improve performance and close the performance gap include ensuring that schools have qualified/certified teachers, supporting thriving and active parent participation programs, using data to direct resources, supporting all students in their learning, and applying consistent standards across all schools for construction and renovation,\u201d Harvey said.\nKarin Miller, a candidate running in Wicomico County\u2019s District 2, said the way to solve this issue is by attracting and retaining quality teachers while also striving to improve the classroom atmosphere.\n\u201cCreating a safe environment where students are able to learn without distraction improves learning outcomes for all,\u201d she said.\nMiller was one of several board candidates who raised concerns about student discipline and its impact on academic performance.\nMike Lukas, who is running for reelection to the Charles County Board of Education, said: \u201cI have obligated funding for counselors and psychologists to help students deal with the effects of not interacting with students for over a year, which manifests itself in disciplinary issues.\u201d\nLukas also said special efforts need to be made to get students back to grade level in reading and math.\nMeanwhile in Howard County, candidate Dan Newberger said he wants the district to \u201cdevelop and implement comprehensive, tailored, data-driven pandemic recovery plans for every school.\u201d\nAnd Russ Johnson, who is running in Cecil County\u2019s District 5, said students have fallen behind and the district must refocus its efforts on a rigorous and high-standard program of instruction. Johnson said that this would require school employees to spend time in the classroom and tutoring students who need the most help.\n\u00a0\u201cAn all-hands-on-deck approach will be necessary,\u201d Johnson said.\u00a0\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "content": "Campaign email: joshuahinebaugh@gmail.com\nAge: 45\nEmployment: Senior specialist in plant automation at Viatris, a pharmaceutical company.\u00a0\nEducation: Associate\u2019s degree in computer information management from a technical college called Computer Tech in Fairmont, West Virginia.\u00a0\nWhy are you running for school board?\nI think our school board and members need to have more transparency. Get the parents more involved. So, I have a 10-year-old daughter currently in the school system and kind of feel like we\u2019re on the outside looking in. \u2026 I\u2019m just running to help provide that transparency and try to make the best decisions for our schools.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the school board?\nI think I\u2019ll be a good candidate because I\u2019ll question everything. I\u2019m not just going to go with the status quo just because, let\u2019s say, the state or federal government will give us money for the program. I\u2019m going to ask questions as to why we\u2019re getting that money or why they decided to do that if it indeed would be the best fit for our students.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nRonald Reagan is probably one of the best leaders that I\u2019ve ever lived under\u2026. I was young whenever he was in office, but I just liked everything he stood for and how he handled himself, and he was just a good, cool-headed, calm president.\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nSo currently one of the biggest issues facing our school board is school closures in our area. Our school utilization is way down, and that\u2019s just due to the declining younger population. I\u2019d like to be able to somehow fix or keep the teachers that are here. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest issues as we lose our population, so then we\u2019re forced to close down schools. So if we can have better-paying either teacher jobs or just jobs in the area in general, that will keep the younger generation here in the area.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\nSchool safety is always an issue. I mean, you never know, you never know even with the safety resource officers there, you just kind of never know what can happen. I mean, there are a lot of crazy people in the world so what I\u2019d like to do is work more with local law enforcement officers or find a way to get more safety resource officers in the schools. Currently, we have a couple of areas where we only have one officer dedicated to two schools \u2026 trying to find funding for that for more resources somehow, some way \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that looks like at this point.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nI think we\u2019re going away from what everyone was brought up and taught, we\u2019re going more toward critical race. I think that\u2019s probably what this question was about, critical race theory. So, I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding of what critical race theory is, it\u2019s not white or Black, it\u2019s about the laws that were made pertaining mainly to the white man which is, I don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s the truth. Honestly, I think we need to get back to our roots and actually teach why, and how things went on. So, they always say history repeats itself. So how can we improve that to make that known?\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nI don\u2019t necessarily think that any books should be removed. If someone has a view and they want to read about it, that\u2019s fine. As long as they\u2019re age-appropriate, I\u2019m fine with that.",

We lost a lot of ground to the pandemic declaration and students have lost valuable time and experience in the classroom.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it? \u00a0\nI am intensely concerned about school safety. We very recently had at least two, major, violent incidents at our schools and one of those ended in a death. I am hearing more and more (directly from parents and students) that students are concerned to even visit restrooms for fear of physical harm. This needs fixed. We should involve experts who can guide our board toward solutions and take it to the parents for input.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nLike most parents, I have been keeping an eye on what is taught in our classrooms. I have noticed that groups from all sides of issues appear to be using our classrooms as a battleground to espouse their varied philosophies\u2026 and sometimes, that may mean that they want to modify, influence, or even censor historical accounts. I want a fair and open treatment of history, taught as reality and fact.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed? \u00a0\nThis seems to be a hotbed issue that arises now and then, and I do not think there is a simple answer to this. There are circumstances where books and topics have been considered inappropriate due to sexual content, violent content, and the like, and have been removed by schools and libraries. I believe that this all comes down to age-appropriate exposure to materials and perhaps that is where the real focus needs to be placed. Do we have a legitimate reason to ask these questions?

    "content": "Campaign email: jlawlerheavner@gmail.com\nAge: 68\nEmployment: I am currently retired, but volunteer regularly in local food pantries, vaccine efforts, and literacy tutoring.\nEducation: Master of Science in Public Health from University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI believe that a strong public education is the foundation of a civil society. Upon retirement and upon moving back to my hometown, I began seeking ways to give back to the community that gave me a strong foundation. The Board of Education is a key backbone of a community. Allegany County Public Schools employ many talented and dedicated professionals and staff. The Maryland Blueprint for Education presents a unique opportunity to raise the bar for educating our future citizens and for bridging gaps in rural and lower income economic settings. I want to be a part of that change.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy background in public health, my dedication to raising the bar of civil conversations, my intention to set good examples for our youth, and my experience in working with individuals from varied backgrounds make me a particularly strong candidate for leading our local public schools forward as we continue to emerge from a global pandemic.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorence Nightingale was a public figure who I continue to admire. She is the founder of modern nursing and also a statistician. She led a revolution in healthcare by proving that hospitals that were dirty and served poor food were just as dangerous (and sometimes more so!) than the injuries of the wounded soldiers that she cared for during the Crimean war! Data-based decisions can indeed lead to life-saving practices!\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe past two and half years have brought new challenges for coming together as a society to beat back a communicable disease that has threatened our health and safety. Both teachers and students have experienced losses as a result. Forging and improving community partnerships can help students recover from educational deficits that they experienced during this time. Likewise, providing educators, counselors, and safety officers with the resources they need can go a long way toward facing these challenges going forward.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSafety is a significant concern when school shootings have become so frequent. Children cannot learn when they do not feel safe. Allegany County has added security officers and School Resource Officers while simultaneously increasing the number of school psychologists and counselors, thus creating a safer environment for students to grow and learn about the world and themselves. Being \u2018different\u2019 need not lead to bullying and social isolation, which can then lead to low self-esteem, resentment, and harm. Increased presence of authority and mental health professionals will go a long way towards making everyone feel safer at school.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nAs long as history is taught in truth and in context, students can become critical thinkers and understand not only the past, but also the present and how history influences the future. I believe this is the current model in our county. When we know better, we can do better.\u00a0\nIt seems that this question is probing for an opinion regarding critical race theory. This is not a topic that is taught at the primary or secondary level, so this is not a legitimate concern.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents should be encouraged to read from a broad palette of genres, authors, and perspectives. Banning books leads to limiting freedom of thought and, therefore, education. It is an authoritarian method leading to thought control, and is a dangerous practice. At the same time, students should be encouraged to discuss and question what they read. This is what learning is all about!",

I say this broadly because safety is the catalyst for a positive school climate that directly impacts academic performance and can include all issues ranging from nutrition to the school-to-prison pipeline. More narrowly focused, I would establish a school safety workgroup to work as a collaborative partner to the existing school safety task force to ensure consideration of ongoing problems of practice, strengthen multi-tiered systems of integrated supports to be used to inform comprehensive student-centered safety plans in partnership with targeted community school efforts, and root MCS\u00a0 (Managing Crisis Safely) training in learning & development sciences.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is one of my top issues on my platform. In addition to the aforementioned, I would ensure intentional emphasis and supports to ensure schools are on the pathway to reach Optimally Safe School Status, Common Sense Schools status, and increased district membership in the M.A.S.R.O (Maryland Association of School Resource Officers) to ensure co-creation of best practices with relevant context as a necessary stopgap to long-term approaches.\u00a0\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nBased on the descriptions of the Maryland State Standards and Framework, each standard emphasizes inquiry, and I believe that to be a positive approach to allowing students to become critical consumers and empowered learners.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nLibraries should include a range of books that allow students to explore, learn and make meaning of the world around them and/or reimagine a world.",

There are many parents so afraid to speak up, so I will be their voice.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI admire ALL of the parents who are standing up for their children and not backing down. I admire the teachers who teach a child how to think and not what to think. We as a society have lost the ability to think for ourselves because many were never taught critical thinking skills.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nTwo words, Parental Rights.\u00a0\nA parent should be the voice advocating for their child, not a teachers union. Politics and indoctrination of any kind need to be removed from the classroom. Our children are too far behind and schools should be teaching academics, not broadcasting their political affiliations to their students. The No. 1 question I get asked by parents is my stance on CRT (Critical Race Theory) being taught within the classroom. My response is NO I do not believe, along with the majority of parents, that CRT does not belong in our schools.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it? \u00a0\nSchool safety is a major issue. We need to be proactive instead of reactive. Parents, police and school officials need to sit down and work out issues that are noticed at different schools. I am also NOT for police reform that wants to allocate the money given to SROs into \u201cother areas.\u201d We need more officers within our schools, not less.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy concern is that not all history is being taught and major gaps are either being left out or rewritten. Parents also want access to their children\u2019s curriculum and want to know why everything is so secretive. Bottom line is they want to know what their children are learning in school and how to find that information without going down a rabbit hole that leads nowhere.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, there are oversexualized books that do not belong in our schools. For example \u201cGender Queer\u201d is an inappropriate book that illustrates sexual acts and is highly inappropriate for minors. Parents should be made aware of what books are entering their children\u2019s libraries instead of them being kept in the dark of what books their children has access to.",

I have experienced\u00a0 every level of education, early childhood, elementary and secondary. I also have an expertise in special education as I have been a special education teacher, special education coordinator, and director of special education. This gives me an opportunity to provide a different perspective as a board member and use my experience to help shape a diverse policy.\u00a0\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nI currently do not have a public leader that I admire.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThere are a wide range of issues that our school system is facing, which all appear equally important. However, improving third grade reading proficiency is highly important as it determines a child\u2019s life trajectory. Third grade reading proficiency is correlated with high school dropout, continued poverty, criminal activity, and behavioral concerns. In order to increase third grade proficiency, we must improve kindergarten readiness. This entails improving community educational programs, child care center, Head Start. Once students arrive in kindergarten we must improve teaching and learning from grades K-3 to ensure students are proficient by the spring assessment window.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is the utmost important in education. We need to ensure that as a district we open the lines of communication about any possible threats to the school. All threats should be taken seriously, in addition (to) practicing safety drills, and deploying safety mechanisms to reduce the chances of violence occurring, will be key.\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe that all aspects of history should be taught, the good and the bad. History is the past, as an educational system we can not only choose the good facts to teach and dismiss bad facts. Bad facts provide opportunity to gain understanding and a holistic perspective.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not believe books should be removed from the library. However, I do believe books in the library should be culturally relevant to the population of students in that specific school.",

I am a graduate of our county\u2019s public school system, as is my wife, who I met in school. Our three sons are all grads of this public school system. My parents and grandparents were also graduates of this school system. I want to give back to the school system that provided the foundation for my entire family\u2019s success. I have already served on the board for 6 \u00bd years and truly want another four years to finish much of what we started to improve the schools but were interrupted by the pandemic.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI have the experience already, having served as stated for 6\u00bd years. I have a passion for public education and making it the best it can be. As a local business leader, I see firsthand what the impact is on our county of graduating well educated young people. It is a fact: The strongest economic driver for any area is the quality of their public schools. I want to be a part of continuing to make ours the best!\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nJake Day, mayor of Salisbury, Maryland. Mayor Day is a young man who has a passion to make Salisbury great. He is dedicated to this goal and works tirelessly to do so. He is not paid very well and could easily find a higher paying job but does this one because he wants to make a difference. And, of note, he is a graduate of our public school system and is a huge supporter of it to this day.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThere are several important issues facing us today. But I have to say school safety ranks No. 1 for me. If our faculty, staff, students and parents do not feel safe in our school, then it is nearly impossible to accomplish our other goals. Students can\u2019t learn and teachers can\u2019t teach if they do not feel safe. See next answer for what I will do, if elected again.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am always concerned about school safety. In my tenure on this board, we have successfully secured all school entry vestibules, air-conditioned the remaining schools (which allows all doors and windows to remain closed and locked) and provided many hours of safety training for all school personnel. My next step, if reelected, is to \u201cpush\u201d for school resource officers in all schools, not just middle and high schools.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nI do not. All curriculums must be and are approved by the Board of Education. Therefore, I am comfortable with what is being taught. I also have visited classrooms and seen firsthand what we are teaching.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nIf we are apprised of a book that a parent or other citizen believes is in a school library and should be removed; we have a policy and process in place to review said book. The policy states the book is reviewed by a committee of parents, teachers and other citizens and they make a recommendation to the superintendent and the board of whether it should be removed. As a board member, I believe we should abide by their decision.",

Harford County has consistently been underfunded for many years even though it ranked among the best in education in Maryland. The pandemic and lack of equitable pay for support staff has resulted in losing support staffers for students with special needs.

My biggest concern is historical facts being ignored solely because it\u2019s not comforting or easy to understand. History is meant to be a tool to understand events, why they occurred, and the ultimate result of the events. To prevent proper teaching of history is to minimize society\u2019s understanding of the past.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nThe dynamics of school libraries has changed over the years to include not only academic materials, but also diverse coming of age stories that allow people can connect to. I do not support censorship of reading materials so as long as such materials are instructional.

One is physical safety, which in our county could help solve with the appropriate number of school resource officers. The other is mental safety, which is being exerted on our students by Critical Race Theory.

    "content": "Campaign email: emnu2005@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.emilyfortalbot.com\nAge: 40\nEmployment: Owner of a commercial photography studio\nEducation: B.A., Northeastern University\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nI have four children who attend Talbot County Public Schools and personal experience with three different school buildings, and programs ranging from Gifted and Talented, to Special Education, to honors level courses, to early intervention, to P3 and PreK. I bring a background of public service and arts to the table, and I believe deeply in giving back to my community through my service and leadership. I say without a hesitation that I am an excellent board member. It is an honor to serve in this role; my presence has made a positive impact in our district. I humbly ask the voters of Talbot County for another four years to continue the important work I have started.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nFor the past four years I have consistently received feedback from the community about the excellent work that I do as a BOE member. I lead with integrity and fairness, ask the challenging questions no one else wants to, keep student success at the forefront, make sure parents\u2019 and educators\u2019 interests are well represented, and always push for greater transparency. I have gained much acclaim for being the most engaged and responsive board member, and for demanding positive data-backed results for our community. In addition, I am well versed in the rules and guidelines of being a BOE member, the regulations set forth for schools by the State of Maryland, and, as such, am ready to hit the ground running.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI have a great level of admiration for strong women who make huge impacts in their community, and inspire other women and girls to step up and serve \u2013 such as Jacinda Ardern, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Malala (Yousafzai). But at the end of the day I truly believe that we should not focus on admiring public leaders. They aren\u2019t celebrities. They are public servants and need to be appreciated and held accountable as such. A great public leader will inspire you to act to make your community better, not be someone who wants to be held on a pedestal. Some of our strongest leaders have been the most humble, and I will always admire service for the act of service \u2013 not for accolades.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe greatest indicator for student success is the presence of a quality teacher in the classroom \u2013 this is the greatest challenge facing us in Talbot County. With the nationwide mass exodus from education, we must retain our excellent educators and also recruit their equally excellent peers. We can address this by being the most competitive in terms of pay and benefits, providing our teachers support in the classroom (including increasing instructional assistants), and empowering our teachers with more time to plan, prep and collaborate. We need to take an out-of-the-box look at how to creatively support our teachers and ensure every student in TCPS has a quality teacher leading their class.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nAs a parent of four TCPS students I am, and will always be, concerned about school safety. I am proud of our partnership with local law enforcement to bring more SROs into our schools over the past four years. Reaching each student and giving them connections to the school, a feeling of ownership, and a sense of belonging goes far to create a more connected and safe school community. In order for students to feel and be safe at school we need to attend to all potential safety risks \u2013 from physical security of the buildings, to mental health and wellness, to appropriately addressing bullying, to effective discipline measures.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nHistory needs to be taught accurately and dispassionately. We cannot take sides with history, we just have to be honest about it. We have to acknowledge events that happened and how they shaped what came after. Then that information needs to lead our students to critical thinking, high-level classroom discussions, and greater knowledge. My time in our history classrooms tells me our teachers are doing that, and our AP history scores bear that out. We need more rigorous and engaging material and class options to continue that. What there is no room for in our schools is turning our classrooms into political battlefields to advance or demonize our neighbors.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nNo. First, our librarians are professionals who curate their libraries to reflect age, curriculum, cultural, and content-appropriate books for the students at their schools. Second, books are keys that open minds and need to be accessible to do their job. No education has ever been furthered due to the banning of a book. That said, some students do need guidance to select books that reflect the values and beliefs of their own home, and it falls on parents to help their children understand what their family considers acceptable when it comes to library choices. Not everyone\u2019s choices will be the same, and in removing a book as an option for all, it limits the choice of other students and families.",

I know education opens doors to opportunities that would not be available otherwise. Our education is on the decline, proficiency is down, teachers do not stay in the career, and children\u2019s mental health is suffering.\u00a0 HCPS needs a strong analytical team that has the tenacity to correct the course. I am a mother of two adult boys and a grandmother of two inquisitive toddlers. I want to make sure they get an education that is rich with academic challenge that gives them a path to a vocation. This will secure their future and makes a positive contribution to our country.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am a good candidate because I know how to work collaboratively, identify the variables, solve complex problems, ask good questions, and have integrity that can be trusted. I have 32 year\u2019s career experience as an engineer in testing and evaluation for the Army. I was assigned the number one program in the Army to lead the analysis effort, we were successful. Also, I have worked with young mothers in need of life skills to overcome the challenges of parenting. I taught a course in the Harford Detention System entitled \u201cBecoming a Responsible Mother.\u201d This evolved into a non-profit, Powerful Parenting, offered to parents who desire better skills and want to network with other parents.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nGov. Ron Desantis, because he stood up to Disney for their \u201cwoke\u201d practices. Disney has always provided a world of fantasy and creativity that appeals to children. As such they should be responsible to create an environment free from sexualization. Instead, Disney encouraged free expression to their design team who admitted, intentionally adding inappropriate sexual content. This content was being made available to our youth at all age levels, to include toddlers. Standing up to Disney showed integrity, that he cares about future generations, and he is not in politics for the money. So many politicians go along with big business despite the effect it is having on our country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nMost important issue is teacher retention. Dr. William Kirwan\u2019s proposal (in the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future) is to increase salaries to attract higher quality teachers. I say we need to respect the ones we have and create an environment with decreased toxicity. Dr. Kirwan stated that many teachers leave after two years in the profession, with no data on why. To understand and correct this situation, I would develop a strategy using the Balanced Scorecard Method. Interview each teacher, administrators, and staff to determine expectations. Employ expectation management in areas needed and monitor teacher needs in terms of resources and mental health. Use a volunteerism approach from within school and community to fill needs.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSafety is a number one priority. HCPS has done a good job working with local police for opening and dismissal monitoring, but I am concerned about hallway monitoring and verifying that protocols are being followed. I would like to create hall/entrance monitors that could be fulfilled by volunteers, schools staff, or technology. HCPS has developed an app to alert parents and community of issues at the school, which I think will be helpful in preventing interference with professionals responding to incidents close to school zones. That said, schools need to inform community of this new capability and provide training when needed.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nSince I am not a parent, obtaining specific curriculum is not possible. I am working with the school to obtain a sample of curriculum. That said, I am concerned about a cancel culture that exists both in schools and society. I am concerned that critical race theory is being taught in the schools, creating division rather than assimilation. I am also concerned about the ideologies students identify with, that are counter to the American dream. Many graduates support a socialistic government and no longer have that drive to own a piece of Americana.\u00a0\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes, if a book contains content that is not appropriate for students that have access to the library it should be removed. Any book that is sexually explicit or writes about sexual ideations should be removed. I strongly believe that the over-sexualization of our children is problematic and all attempts to limit exposure are necessary.",

I have been active in our community since high school, and I am committed to the advancement of my community. I have a unique and valuable perspective to bring to the board as a Sikh-Indian American who graduated from BCPS in the recent past and is now a young professional.

He showed that no matter what you look like or where you come from, you can achieve your dreams even in the face of prejudice. Finally, I admire the way he stuck to the issues and policy while fighting the good fight and helping others instead of being torn down by the low-bore attacks that he faced. Everyone can look to President Obama to find an example of how one can carry themselves with grace while persevering through adversity.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most pressing issue within the county school system is ensuring that the school system\u2019s primary focus is on student success after graduating, whether that is through college or other avenues. To accomplish this, we need to do everything we can to ensure Baltimore County Public Schools lives up to the promise of quality education for all by focusing on student well-being, which includes addressing financial literacy within the curriculum and providing adequate mental health education. If we teach students how to manage their wealth and their health, we are setting them up for success no matter their path.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nIt should be a top priority for BCPS to ensure that all students and staff find themselves in a safe and healthy learning environment. BCPS has led Maryland in school arrests by student resource officers (SRO), with the largest arrestable offense being \u201cdisruption.\u201d This highlights the problem of unclear delineation between situations where law enforcement intervention is appropriate and where school-based administrative procedures are appropriate. The board needs to create new, clear policies that dictate what situations are to be addressed by SROs and what offenses are to be dealt with solely by the administration and clearly communicate these changes with SROs, parents and administrations.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nHistory must be taught in the way that it happened. We must teach our students all of our history\u2014good parts and the bad parts. It is essential that we do so, so that we are teaching our kids how to solve the problems of today and tomorrow by learning and understanding the successes and the failures of the past. We can not shy away from issues that make us uncomfortable. It is a disservice to our students and is detrimental to their future. We should not waver in the face of challenges, we need to tackle them head-on and provide a world-class education for our students.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nBooks should not be removed from schools. It is important that all views of the world are represented and available for students to learn about in an educational setting. Banning books runs the risk of compromising a student\u2019s development and stunting their learning and curiosity about the world. Removing books is denying students the chance to understand values and ideas that may not be readily apparent in their daily lives and shying away from issues that make us uncomfortable is contradictory to the goal of setting our students up for future success.",

    "summary": "Ethan Loewen, a 47-year-old financial advisor with management experience, is running for the school board, citing his unique background including personal and family experiences with learning disabilities, gifted programs, and immigrant education challenges. He admires public leaders like John McCain and Colin Powell for their leadership qualities.",
    "content": "Ethan Loewen\nCampaign email: e.loewen25@yahoo.com\nAge: 47\nEmployment: I am. I don\u2019t want to give out more personal information than what\u2019s on the file. You know what the Board of Elections has.\nEducation: I have some college. I\u2019ve technically I finished three years of college and it was in health care administration.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\nI have a fairly unique set of experiences and skills that are well-rounded for the school board. One, as a manager,\u00a0 I deal with what it is that is needed: the character traits, the skills for people coming out of school in order to be good employees. And I am a financial advisor. So, part of what that deals with is being aware of the changing economy and the skills of the future. And then the other thing is, I was a child with learning disabilities and also some behavioral issues. And then my children were on the exact opposite end of the spectrum: they were in the gifted and talented programs. And the largest portion of my family actually are Hispanics. I have family members that have dealt with coming to America not speaking English as they entered the schools, another hot button topic.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\nWell, the other thing is over the years, I dealt with a lot of teachers and administrators throughout Maryland throughout various states. For years, I\u2019ve been doing that. And so, I get kind of a regular set of feedback from those individuals. And so, I also have a wide perspective, in that regard, with what\u2019s going on in the industry, in different school districts, in different states. And, you know, so I have a constant concern about that. So, it\u2019s really all of those skills combined.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nWell, there are many I do like, but my personal favorites are (the late U.S. senator from Arizona) John McCain and General Colin Powell (the late Secretary of State under President George W. Bush). Obviously part of that is because when a lot of my social and political identity was being developed, they were very prominent, but those are probably the two that I would say the most. And it\u2019s because they had standards. I\u2019m also a veteran, they obviously are veterans. They were very strong leaders. They were very flexible thinkers. And they also understood\u00a0 the American ideals. And they did a very good job of guiding America in the right direction.\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nEquity is the biggest issue. The problem with equity is that it\u2019s very much misunderstood. They divide everyone up into groups based on race, gender, sexual orientation. Certain groups are portrayed as being victims, while other groups are portrayed as being, quote, \u201cprivileged.\u201d With my learning disability, they have a name for me called neurodivergent. I received the assistance I needed. It wasn\u2019t easy. Over a period of a couple of years, it worked very well. The thing is that when I read how equity ideology is applied to the children with my problems of this generation, it would not have helped me at all. It actually would have hurt because it\u2019s discouraging, because it deprives kids of being in control of their destinies. That classification of individuals is very problematic.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\nObviously, the physical safety of children is the number one priority of the Board of Education. So in that sense, you know, it\u2019s my number one priority. There\u2019s a lot that is already being done. There are cameras all over the schools and there\u2019s a command center so if ever there is an event, all the cameras come on and there\u2019s immediate communication with the police. No doors are left unlocked. This is one of the first things I would educate myself on, but at the moment, I would say that I feel confident that a good job is being done. The biggest thing is to make sure that we don\u2019t do what other school districts have done and remove Student Resource Officers from campus.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nThe statement that equity ideologists make is children need to see their ethnicity, their groups, represented and presented. They need to see X number of African Americans or X number of Latinos mentioned. The problem is that\u2019s not what history is about. History is about the events that shaped our culture, that shaped our legal system. So you\u2019re primarily going to be talking Western Europeans for a good part of American History. So what equity ideology does is it basically ignores one of the fundamental reasons of why history is taught. And it tries to replace it with what they believe is psychologically helpful \u2013 but it\u2019s not helpful at all. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s tons of parents, even non-white parents, showing up to school boards saying you can\u2019t teach this stuff to my child.\u00a0\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nYes, it\u2019s age old and and and is expected to be done. In this county, there are books that parents want to be removed. I believe there\u2019s a list that various parents have put together of like 40 books. I don\u2019t have a view on those books, per se. but we should initiate the process to review the books. What the complaints from the parents revolve around is two items. One is that there are books in the libraries that are blatantly pornographic. There\u2019s even a couple of books that have pictures as X rated as you can get. And the other thing is some of the books portray pedophilia in a sympathetic light. If how the parents present them is shown to be true, then yes, they should be removed. There\u2019s plenty of phenomenal books that can replace any number of books that may need to be removed.",

    "content": "Campaign email: jonathan@votejonathanbriggs.com\nAge: 34\nEmployment: Policy manager, America Forward.\nEducation: Master of Science in Education, Johns Hopkins School of Education\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nI am running for the school board because I believe that every child deserves access to a fair, equal and transformative education experience. What I learned while in the classroom was that if we want to see real change in our education system, then it will take dedicated leaders with the knowledge and \u201cknow-how\u201d working as strong champions for change. I believe our education system is broken in many ways, and I would like to bring my unique experience \u2013 both as a classroom teacher in some of our nation\u2019s toughest schools, and as a policy professional \u2013\u00a0 to represent members of my community, including parents, teachers, students and schools.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nAs a former teacher and near-peer mentor, I have committed my life\u2019s work to becoming a strong champion and advocate for education equity, including being integral in spearheading Illinois\u2019 first ever Children\u2019s Advisory Council, crafting equitable legislation that addresses the opportunity gap that persists in public education (while working for a member of Congress), and developing sound recommendations for the DC Mayor Education to improve its Safe Passage Program. I believe these experiences will support me in representing students, parents and teachers, and in being a sounding board for change.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nI most admire the great (former South African president) Nelson Mandela. I believe his strength of character, and his ability to persist despite insurmountable odds, is truly inspiring. It was clear that in many ways the odds were stacked against Mr. Mandela; he was even a political pariah at one point \u2013\u00a0 with an over-27-year prison sentence that would cause the toughest of us to quiver in fear. Despite all of that, he took every setback and made it a comeback, and that is the type of leader that I aspire to be. Most importantly, he didn\u2019t do this alone, but with a community that\u00a0 supported him and fought alongside him.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI think the biggest issue facing the school board is addressing the learning gap that persists in Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools. The pandemic has exacerbated an already strained learning environment, and students\u2019 academics have been most impacted. If I were elected to the school board, my first day in office would be taking stock of our budget. There is a surplus of funding that is coming down from the Biden-Harris administration to address learning loss at the state and local level. I would want to ensure that we were addressing students\u2019 learning needs by identifying where the steepest gaps exist and then allocating funding to address those needs in partnership with the CEO.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am very concerned about school safety. The steady uptick of gun violence in schools is alarming, and it is having a significant impact on student mental health. I believe a proactive step to begin to address school safety in the long run is investing in more mental health resources for students, that includes school psychologists, social workers and partnerships with local organizations that provide mental health resources. Additionally, addressing the teacher shortage can ensure that there are reasonable class sizes, which will help teachers develop more engaging relationships with students.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI think history should be inclusive of many different perspectives, which includes the perspectives of marginalized groups. This will support students\u2019 ability to think critically about the implications that historical events have had on different communities and how it impacted them. This also provides students with a richer and fuller understanding of our shared history. I believe students should be exposed to diverse perspectives, authors, and content, and it is schools\u2019 and educators\u2019 responsibility to provide students with a well-rounded education. Ultimately students should be challenged to think critically in the classroom, which will prepare them for the rigor of our future.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI think books that provide students with a better understanding of the world around them, in an academic sense, should be largely available for students to consume. If I were to disagree with any book being in a school library, it would be a book that does not serve to provide students with an academic and well-rounded understanding of the world around them. I am a firm believer that any book that challenges a student\u2019s perspective is a good opportunity for them to ask questions and investigate the subject matter further to become more knowledgeable about it.",

Data on student achievement during those two years is not available to the public, and one can only guess how far our students have fallen behind.

At this time, not all the schools in our county have school resource officers on duty. Arrangements must be made to extend that security blanket to all schools. The school environment can also be damaged by internal disruption. Students and faculty cannot feel safe or perform well if order is not maintained. Unruly and threatening behavior benefits no one.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI do not know the specifics of the history courses taught in Talbot Schools.

I am running to return their voice, board transparency and parental inclusion. Education is suffering and we need to return to traditional learning.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am the strongest candidate for Board of Education because I am the parent of two Worcester County Schools graduates. I am very familiar with the unnecessary politics in the education system and have dealt with them over the years. I am not a former educator who can be influenced by teachers unions and school administrators. My constituents are my friends and neighbors.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI personally feel like choosing one particular public leader creates bias. Board of Education seats are nonpartisan, and part of why I am running is to get politics out of the schools. I admire hard working, honest and transparent public servants.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue we face is the failing education system in place. High percentages of students in Worcester County are not proficient in math and reading. When elected I will work to make resolutions\u00a0 to the curriculum and teaching methods to a more traditional style, which have proven successful.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSchool safety is a high priority that with communication and cooperation of local police agencies, school administrators and commissioners can be easily\u00a0 improved.

History should be taught in its original and unchanged form. We are teaching very little history and in a biased form. Although some of history may be dark,\u00a0 we can learn from it and not make those mistakes again. When history is changed, it is no longer there to learn from.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI absolutely believe books pertaining to sex, sexuality, anti-America and anti-police should be removed from school libraries. Students do not go to publicly funded schools for those types of education. This is for families and students to decide at home and there are public libraries for these types of materials.",

During the lockdowns and mask mandates I also saw how many of them suffered from not being in the classroom. The social isolation and loss of academic learning took its toll. The data now coming out is revealing significant delays for our students in academics, cognition, speech and language, as well as social skills. Student mental health has also been impacted. I jumped into this race, though I am not a politician, because I really care about kids and want to make sure this never happens again. I also believe we need to start having our schools focus on education without politics.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nAs a former school psychologist, I have spent 25 years advocating for students and plan to do that on the school board as well. Our children deserve academic excellence, including graduating with the necessary skills needed so that they can be productive citizens as adults. Supporting programs that focus on students\u2019 strengths and providing them with opportunities to do that, whether it be volunteer opportunities or learning to play a musical instrument or participating in sports etc.,\u00a0 are wonderful ways to address and increase positive mental health and wellness. Finally, I will fight for bringing back common sense policies and transparency to create positive and safe school environments.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI always admired Dr. (Martin Luther) King\u2019s message to judge a person by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. I think he would be saddened today to see that there is a movement that is being pushed in our schools to polarize children instead of unite them.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nThere are several issues that I am passionate about, but I will focus on the most important ones to me, including providing transparency to parents, including curriculums that respect their values, promoting safety policies in our schools that work, and let our teachers teach and our children learn, and making sure there are no more lockdowns and mandates.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nYes, I am a big advocate for school safety. Over the past decade we have seen a culture of lax discipline policies that were politically driven. I will advocate for policies that protect our teachers and students and get students whose behaviors are out of control the proper consequences and supports, such as alternative placements so that they can be helped as well.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe in curriculums that promote unity and not division. We have enough polarization in our society and it is not helpful to push school pedagogy that focuses and creates groups of victimhood. We can still teach history appropriately without focusing on identity politics. Public schools should be transparent about their curricula and teach content that fosters a civil society where everyone can flourish.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes, I believe that the sexualization of our children is inappropriate and robs them of their childhood and innocence and that books that do that have no place in our schools. Protecting our children is key.",

My platform focuses on four pillars: Equity for all students (including mental health services and special education services implementation); Teacher Advocacy & Support; Community & Family Engagement; and Transparent & Open Communication.

Most importantly, she was a champion for equality and equal rights for all. For this, I admire her and her work, which left a lasting legacy in our country and the world.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nImpacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including learning loss and mental health needs, are the most important issues facing our school community.\u00a0\nI would like to focus on added supports to ensure that our special education students are receiving the services that they need to succeed. I would also advocate for additional programs including summer enrichment, accelerated learning courses, partnerships with tutoring centers, etc. to help students get back on grade level or beyond.\u00a0\nIn addition, I would like to focus on hiring more mental health professionals, including school counselors, mediators, etc. to address the increased mental health needs of both the students, teachers, and school staff.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nAs a parent, school safety is always in the back of my mind, as I am sure it is for many parents.\u00a0 In order to ensure our schools are safe from threats and individuals that seek to harm our students, we must take a multi-layered approach to include comprehensive screening and reevaluation of teachers, visitors, volunteers, and anyone who enters our school building. We must also foster a culture of ownership with our entire school community to encourage \u201csee something, say something.\u201d\u00a0 Finally, we must continually evaluate and test our safety mechanisms working closely with our Director of School Safety to ensure that the processes in place continue to be effective.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nStudents are in school to become educated.\u00a0 My only concern is that history is taught as accurately as possible at an age-appropriate level, and that the curriculum is culturally competent and responsive and includes the contributions and lessons from all groups of people in our communities.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nIn most cases, I do not feel that there is any reason to remove a book from a school library. There may be topics that are not age-appropriate and in those instances, the librarian does a good job of directing students to the kinds of books that are appropriate for their age and grade. This would have to be addressed on a case by case basis, of course, and something that as a board member, I would have to consult with my colleagues on.",

We are not where we need to be, our students have suffered academic, social, and emotional losses during the pandemic and they need our support and quality instruction with a challenging academic curriculum now.\nOur high school students should all have the opportunity to participate in career and technology education. Learning a skill, earning certifications, earning college credits, and practical experience in a career field is valuable for all students.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI believe in a quality public education for all students and will work to make that possible.\u00a0 We need to improve and probably in some areas make substantial changes. We are educating students to be informed and knowledgeable citizens and also to be prepared to excel in jobs and careers that might not currently exist.

I am willing to work hard, use data to make informed decisions and always put students first.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI admired Cathi Forbes, she is a delegate representing 42A, the greater Towson area in Baltimore County. My friendship with Cathi Forbes goes back almost 20 years. Throughout this time I have witnessed what an outstanding community activist she has been. She spearheaded Towson Parents United to work toward a new elementary school, was instrumental in obtaining renovations and additions for other schools. She has worked with the Students Support Network, particularly during the pandemic. She collected food, delivered it to the site, and volunteered. Cathi works tirelessly in the community and the state legislature. She is always ready to listen and help.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nWe have several issues, however one is the inability of board members to work together in a civil manner as a group. As a board, school facilities, retaining teachers, and providing a challenging academic curriculum for all students would be top priorities. Building a more efficient school system so that we are making the best use of our funding and our employees is critical also.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am concerned about school safety, I believe we all are. It is too easy for individuals with mental health issues to obtain weapons. There are steps that we can take. Let\u2019s make it clear to teachers, students, and parents that if they have a concern or see something they need to report it immediately. Identify students that we may have concerns about and reach out with assistance. We need to look at laws that would limit access to weapons for individuals that are under twenty-one, especially automatic weapons. Individuals have a right to own a weapon, that is not the issue, the issue is protecting our students and staff.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe that we should teach history as it actually occurred. We need to acknowledge historically what we did right and where we made mistakes. We need to do this for other countries as well. We need to look at the accomplishments of all our citizens as our students need role models and often it is difficult to find them in history books,\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes there may be circumstances when books should not be allowed, however I believe that the school systems do an excellent job of reviewing books and placing them at appropriate grade levels\u00a0 Books that promote hatred of people, cultures, and religions should not be allowed.",

I led through the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and now have the opportunity to help students, staff and families recover. I am deeply knowledgeable of the PGCPS $2.6 billion annual budget. I have contributed to positive change in system resources, including expansion of new schools, with one delivered in my first term, and nine more on the way in the next two years throughout the county. I have served in a leadership role on the Community Schools strategy, expanding academic enrichment and mental health services to 95 Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future funded schools.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a 17-year active resident of Prince George\u2019s County. Before I ran for the board, I had a track record of success serving as the president of the Gateway CDC board and as a parent leader of the Mount Rainier Elementary PTO. I am known as a bridge builder among many PGCPS schools in District 3. I am running for reelection to continue to contribute to building an equitable and inclusive system by drawing on my life and work experiences.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nI am grateful to the many Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, and national leaders who paved the way for women running for elected office. Witnessing the leadership of Maryland Delegate Joseline Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk (D-Anne Arundel and Prince George\u2019s), and the bills she sponsored for LGBTQ+, immigrant and health equity, made me understood the power of grassroots elected leaders \u2013 the PGCPS mothers right here in our communities fighting for and making positive change.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nImplementing the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future legislation, which is based on the Kirwan Commission findings to improve academic achievement, is the most important issue facing the Board of Education. I support the COVID-19 pandemic academic recovery plans developed by CEO Dr. Monica Goldson that expand upon the programs in the Blueprint. PGCPS has been a leader in pandemic response, building tutoring and summer programs to provide year-round supports for learning loss gaps, as well as implementing the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future community schools model with wraparound services that include mental health practitioners in school buildings.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents, staff and families define safety in many ways. I will continue to advocate for funding for new clean energy school buildings that are built with the features of secure front entrances and modern doors and locks; improve safe walking paths to schools and advocate for a fully staffed crossing guard program; promote mitigating COVID-19 spread through a high vaccine rate; and support budgets with increased services for bullying prevention and restorative approaches to conflict resolution.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nPGCPS is a culturally responsive school district in curriculum development and a system where educators teach the truth about U.S. history. There is room for expansion of more inclusive experiences for Hispanic students who are now more than 36% of the student body, such as the inclusion of the history and culture of Latin America.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not agree with book banning. However, school library catalogs should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they include content that represents the diversity of the students of PGCPS and the commitment to culturally responsive teaching.",

I am always trying to talk and listen to the students as they are who I\u2019m fighting for. They deserve a strong academic education so they have a better opportunity for a successful future. I\u2019m also an advocate for parental rights. I LISTEN and I\u2019m not afraid to speak out on serious issues and will fight for the education these kids are entitled to.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nRight now I admire Glenn Youngkin in Virginia for standing strong to improve his state\u2019s school system in spite of some of the backlash he gets from some other politicians. He\u2019s staying true to what he said he would do. I admire anyone who doesn\u2019t play the political game to get votes and continues to follow through on their word. I think character is very important. (Maryland Gov. Larry) Hogan proved he didn\u2019t have much of that.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI believe the system as a whole is failing our youth. I\u2019m watching kids graduate high school that can barely read. It is unacceptable. I\u2019m seeing parents pulling their kids out of the public system to either home school them or send them to private schools. Politics DO NOT belong in schools. We are lowering the required GPA to 2.25 when that\u2019s the worst thing we can do now. Again, get a strong ACADEMIC base back and begin to challenge these kids. EDUCATE THEM. They deserve better and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll fight to give them.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nVery concerned. I have spoken with MANY kids and they are afraid within their own schools. Kids are bringing in weapons and nothing is done. It is impossible to learn if a kid is constantly\u00a0 in fight or flight mode. We have allowed it to get this far so I would be in favor of metal detectors to help ensure safety. The lack of holding kids responsible for their actions is a huge part of the problem.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nTeach ACCURATE history. Tell them the whole truth. Show them the progress that has been made and stop promoting victimhood. Let us learn from the past and move forward. Kids are STILL being taught how different they are and defined by their skin color. It\u2019s not natural and it needs to stop. But I think the constant attempts to divide them is not by accident.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nAny books that can be deemed as pornographic should have never been put in schools.. Kids aren\u2019t allowed to bring in Bibles yet books pornographic in nature are ok? (A spokesperson for the Charles County Public Schools said the district has no such policy barring students from bringing Bibles to school.) As I have said, they should not be in schools to begin with, especially in the library, accessible to any age student. GET POLITICS OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS!",

My aim is not to become a politician by running for Board of Education. Board of Education should not be a politically charged position nor should it be a stepping stone for future political aspirations. It should be about improving the opportunities and outcomes for children of Baltimore County.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nThe largest single issue facing the school system in Baltimore County is student performance, and educational outcomes are below expectations. The core job of the schools is to educate.\u00a0 Before we can fix the issue we have to identify what components are going into these outcomes. Having 60% of third grade students reading at below grade level is unacceptable. With a per student allocation of over $15,000/student annually we need to do better.\u00a0 Between teachers, bus drivers, support staff and overall facility conditions, much can be done. We have to reverse the attitudes. Getting students to buy into their own education and retaining teachers who are engaged are both critical to outcomes.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSchool safety is obviously a major concern. With recent events of weapons in schools and incidents we cannot be blind to issues. One thing that is a major concern is the appropriate use of discipline. Without consistent enforcement of school policies, up to and including removal of problem students, students find no consequence and teachers find no recourse for disruptions of class. Actual consequences for actions must be understood by students and consistently applied by administrators.\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nMy focus is on the physical state of the schools. My experiences are not in curriculum development. I would need to evaluate specific instances of \u201cHow history is taught.\u201d I believe history should be taught from a factual and neutral perspective.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nBooks must be age-appropriate. Sexualized materials do not belong in Elementary School Libraries. Parents should be allowed to have a voice in the materials that are used in the classroom.",

I want to see that they, and all our children in Baltimore County, receive the best education possible.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\nI am everything that a Baltimore County Board of Education member is supposed to represent. I am a parent of three public school students who has lived in Baltimore County all 43 of my years. I will represent our students, parents and community\u2019s best interest in Education.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nThe son of an Italian immigrant, Vince Lombardi lived the quintessential American dream. At 15 he was studying to be a priest, 40 years later he won his fifth NFL Championship. He was an exceptional teacher and motivator who defined what it means to be a winner: \u201cYou don\u2019t do things right once in a while, you do them right all of the time.\u201d\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nAccording to the most recent reports, only 39% of our second graders are reading at or above grade level and only 34% are there in math. Who knows where are third, fifth, eighth, and 10th graders are because there is no data. The most important issue is getting all of our students up to or above their grade levels in all core subjects.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am very concerned about school safety in our schools for students and teachers. Teachers and students need to know that when rules are broken there will be real consequences. There should be zero tolerance for any act of violence that happens inside a school building.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nTeaching history the way it happened doesn\u2019t mean you are agreeing or promoting it as acceptable. Our history made us who we are today and our children need to keep learning from it. I believe history should be taught exactly the way it happened, the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI don\u2019t believe there is a place in our public school libraries for books that present fiction as nonfiction or books that are sexually explicit.",

Less than 42% are proficient in Math and less than 46% are proficient in English Language Arts (HS less than 59% proficient in ELA). We must fix this. To improve student achievement, we need to refocus our efforts on what should be our core mission: Providing a rigorous, high standards-based academic program of instruction, and hold all parties involved accountable. To fix, an all-hands-on deck approach will be necessary, requiring staff, administrators, and supervisors to spend time in the classroom teaching, as well as tutoring students who are behind. Getting discipline under control will also be a critical piece of the student achievement challenge.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nWe should always be concerned about school safety, and it should remain a top priority. CCPS has done a good job focusing on safety at our schools.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI currently do not have concerns.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, books that contain sexually explicit or age-inappropriate content that kids can access without parental consent. A good test would be if you can\u2019t read excerpts from a book during the public comment slot at a school board meeting, because the language or subject matter is too vulgar or inappropriate, then perhaps that book should not be in the school library for minors to read.",

For far too long, education has been the Achilles of this great county. Two of the biggest detractors for direct investment into our community have been 1) crime and 2) education. Both are directly correlated; an educated population creates a stronger labor force, and sound employment mitigates crime. So, essentially if we focus on building stronger schools we can elevate our whole county. My goal is to use the skills I\u2019ve gleaned from the private and public sector to help elevate the overall school system. As a leader, organizer and a financier I want to implement standards, accountability and key performance indicator to offer a world class education to our community.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI help raise my brother and nephew. One attended a private school and the other attended public. I quickly saw the disparity in education. So, I know firsthand the great things about our school system and its challenges. More importantly, as the executive director for a program at Prince George\u2019s County Council, I developed relationships in PGCPS and with elected officials. Those relationships are critical to advancing the county forward, because we have to operate as one big team with one agenda elevating our county. Lastly, I have the skills and passion. I\u2019ve taken the time to cultivate myself at great institutions of learning, and I have worked in the community for years. I have a heart to serve and a proven track record. Serving is my purpose in life, politics aside.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNelson Mandela. I have an affinity for Africa and the stories of champions of equity and equality. Mandela\u2019s mission was to create equality and equity in South Africa by first abolishing apartheid. I too want to be a champion of equity and equality for our nation and more specifically our school system. Standing on the shoulders of a giant, I too want to pick up that mantle. I believe that every child should have access to a world class education and resources. Those are the keys to social mobility. We must make sure we look at everything with an equity lens and meet families where they are.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board and what would you do about it if elected? (150-word limit)\nSafety. As I knock on doors during the campaign, I hear the same thing. Parents are afraid their kids won\u2019t return the same way they left. Securing our schools and community is the most important issue for me. Safety is the foundation of vulnerability, and without vulnerability learning can\u2019t take place.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSafety. Parents are afraid their kids won\u2019t return the same way they left\u2026.My plan to secure our community/schools: 1) Discussion with community stakeholders about organizing and creating actionable solutions around securing our community. 2) Developing a pipeline of educational professionals that can help the teachers in the classroom. i.e. teachers assistants. 3) Give teachers access to a standardized classroom management course to help deal with post-COVID classroom management. 4) Update the student conduct code and handbook.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that we should focus on giving our students access to all the information available and not try to create a narrative that shies away from the actual abuse or occurrences that have happened in history.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI think that libraries are a microcosm of the world. There are differences of opinion and thought all inside the library. I believe that we should equip our kids with the tools to understand what propaganda is and how narratives can be shape to curate certain perceptions. Critical thinking skills are key to becoming a functional adult. Children need to understand that there may be information out there that can be misleading. I\u2019m more inclined to equip our kids with research and critical thinking skills, so they can go through the process of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not on their own. We wont always be there to help. As the saying goes, teach a person to fish.",

    "content": "Campaign email: scott@fourpointeducation.com\nWebsite: https://joftus4boe.com/about/\nAge: 54\nEmployment: Member, Board of Education; founder and president, FourPoint Education Partners; adjunct professor, George Washington University\nEducation: Doctorate of Education Policy and Leadership, George Washington University\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nMCPS is at a critical juncture as we are (hopefully) coming out of the pandemic and transitioning to a new superintendent and leadership team. I\u2019m running because my experience in advising school boards and superintendents across the country and teaching education leadership to future education leaders is critical to ensuring the systemic improvement we need. No one else on the board or running for the board has the system-level experience and perspective needed for effective transformation.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI have been dedicated to improving outcomes for all students\u2014but especially those who have been traditionally underserved \u2014 my entire career as a teacher, public education advocate, researcher and evaluator, professor, adviser to school boards and superintendents, and\u2014most recently \u2014 school board member. This experience and my perspective makes me uniquely qualified for the Montgomery County Board of Education.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nCongressman Jamie Raskin (D-Takoma Park) is my political hero. He has the intelligence, people skills, and tenacity needed to protect against our current threats to democracy. And here is what he said about my campaign: \u201cScott is doing a great job for us on the Montgomery County Board of Education. We are benefiting from his work with school districts across the country and his significant insight as a professor of educational leadership. We\u2019re lucky to have him where he is using his expertise on behalf of our students and our schools.\u201d\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I teach my graduate students, coherence is the foundation of any effective school district. Coherence is the alignment of strategy, systems, resources and culture to a clear philosophy about how student outcomes will improve. Without coherence, MCPS has struggled to provide high-quality supports to school leaders and to effectively engage community stakeholders.\nTo address this, I have:\n\nEmphasized the need for coherence in improving student outcomes with the board\u00a0 and\u00a0 administration.\nOffered ideas to promote coherence.\u00a0\nAsked questions at the board table to reinforce the move toward greater coherence across the system.\n\nIf elected, this will be the ongoing focus of my work.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nEnsuring the safety of students, families and\u00a0 staff is the top priority for schools, the administration and board. We must also ensure that BIPOC (Black, indigenous and people of color) students are not unfairly disciplined or arrested, which has been the case in MCPS and across the country. Therefore, I support:\n\nMaintaining a close, coordinated relationship with MCPD but removing police offers from having a permanent presence in schools. The key will be to carefully monitor the CEO 2.0 program.\nAdditional (unarmed) security personnel. As a current member of the board, I supported funding for 12 additional positions that can be allocated to schools based on need.\nSignificant budget increases for mental health services.\u00a0\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nIn general, I believe that the teaching of history too frequently fails to address the experience and perspectives of races and cultures other than White males. The board will soon be receiving a draft of an anti-racism audit, which will address this topic, and the board and administration are ready to consider recommendations for changes.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nMy general stance is that books should be included in the library and students should be taught to make decisions about what they read based on their interest, reading ability and values. That said, there is a process by which students, parents or staff can submit concerns about and request removal of a particular book. I think this process is important but needs careful supervision by the board to prevent overuse and abuse.",

I think in politics that is a rare quality.\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe most important issue I see facing me is political polarization. It\u2019s hard to believe that there are political sides in a non-partisan elected role. If we are going to be of true service to our children we will have to put our political egos away and focus on what\u2019s best for the student.\u00a0 We have to understand there will be give and take, and as long as the give or the take is not on just one side, then I think we are accomplishing something and ultimately so will the students.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is very important to me, as I have two children in TCPS. I think they do a great job keeping doors locked and knowing the comings and goings. I think drills are another great tool as well. Making sure everyone knows their roles and can instruct the students calmly and efficiently is key. It is something that will always need to be monitored. Whether it is upgraded equipment or a new manner of drills. I think we are pretty safe and just hope we can keep it at the level we have right now.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe that all of us have learned a lot over the years about our history. Even more in the past 10 years. Some good, some bad. These are public issues that need to be addressed. There comes a time when we have to do what\u2019s right and teach the truth. Not rewriting history but righting history. In a public school, I believe public issues need to be taught or at least addressed in some way. If our public schools are for everyone, a one-sided history seems unfair.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not!\u00a0 There is no reason to remove books that have already been accepted into TCPS.\u00a0 Censorship is not going to keep the students safer or make them smarter.

I witnessed and learned up close and personally the strengths and weaknesses of our small school system. We still have a way to go, but we are on the right track. However, I\u2019m running to drive the school system to become more effective, efficient, and unified in all its core value areas. Attention to this work will be critical as we move through educational changes and challenges. I aim to make Kent County one of the leading school systems, and we are already on that path.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI bring different lenses to the school board service as an educator,\u00a0 consultant, caregiver\u00a0 and community member. As an educator, I understand the needs of my fellow education professionals. The tools and resources they need to be successful in their craft. As a consultant, I see the need for solid operational structures and strategic planning. Caregiver for siblings and relatives in the KCPS system, I know the struggles and successes they have faced in such a rural school system. Being in the community has helped me understand how to bridge the gap between school and community. I know what it means to listen and discern the needs of the county population and student population.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nSarah Johnson Brown. She was a teacher for 44 years and served on the Kent County School Board for 18 years. She believed in education and meeting the needs of the education professionals and children of the school system. After she served as an educator and public official,\u00a0 she worked as a substitute. She has overcome many odds, not limited to racism, the first time reaching the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1970. She has persevered through life challenges, including domestic violence, the death of a son and granddaughter, and raising her four grandchildren after she parented for 18 years. She continues to serve through all her life changes, putting service above herself. That is why I chose her.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nOne of the major issues is the implementation of \u201cBlueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future.\u201d Several moving parts include salary changes, curriculum implementation and accountability measures. This is will be a heavy lift both for school board and the county commissioners. Advocate for the creation of ongoing implementation advisory teams with students, parents, citizens and teachers. These stakeholders would review the systemwide changes and progress of the Blueprint. Hold monthly town halls to inform all stakeholders on progress. We need to work and meet monthly with the county commissioners, to ensure that we are all on the same page with the understanding implementation of the Blueprint.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nThis year I helped the school board propose a resolution to fund school safety initiatives. I have advocated for making sure safety procedures for drills are posted in the classroom to ensure that all educational professionals and scholars understand the drills. I ensured that employees from our school\u2019s operational department were part of their emergency management teams. All KCPS employees received active shooter training, known as ALICE. KCPS needs more training on social-emotional crises and bullying and harassment identification. These are issues that are becoming more prevalent in the ever-changing educational climate. The training needs to be given to all educational professionals.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nNo, I am not concerned about how history is taught in our school system. KCPS believes in an inquiry-based approach to teaching history. It\u2019s not teaching scholars how and what to think about history but investigating primary and secondary sources and making conclusions. I would love to see our educational professionals and school administration help teach scholars about their local history. How do we connect the history taught in class to the surrounding community? History is an ever-changing concept; history and social studies curriculums must be regularly updated and supplemented to ensure that the knowledge and information are current.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nNo, books don\u2019t need to be removed from school bookshelves and school libraries. It is up to curriculum teams to vet books and literary texts to ensure they are up to date. If a book needs to be removed, it must be by a criterion set with precise removal guidelines. Guidelines must be centered around school system policies and procedures. If a parent feels that a text is inappropriate, give the parent an option for their child to receive an alternative text or independent study.",

I believe in a quality public education for all current and future students.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a strong candidate who is unapologetic in my beliefs for the future of our children. I will be objective in decisions and will not be swayed by temptation or fear from the teacher\u2019s union or administration. I am running for this position with the purest of intentions of fixing our school system so the next generation of leaders can be brought up in a safe and effective learning environment in which they will succeed and prosper in adulthood.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nA public leader who does not hold office yet, but is the nominee for lieutenant governor of Maryland is Gordana Schifanelli. Even though she is not a current public leader, I have been inspired by her story and continue to be inspired by her true grit of a candidate. She is unapologetic in her views and stands up for what she believes in. She ran one of the most successful write-in campaigns for her husband to get on their local Kent County school board, and she continues to be a champion for children\u2019s education.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue facing our school board is not being honest and transparent with what is being taught in our schools. Social Emotional Learning, a damaging health framework and constant political agendas are being pushed. We are not spending enough time on the core, classical subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, science and history, an, unfortunately, it shows. Our school board needs to do what is best for the children of the county, not what is best for the teachers unions.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am extremely concerned with school safety. The tag line \u201cGun Free Zones\u201d does not help our schools. We need to focus on making sure our school safety system is checked on a regular basis and staff and students need to be held accountable when rules are broken in regards to safety measures. We need to make sure children and staff feel safe and secure. If new safety measures are found to be needed, we must work together as a community to make sure those measures are met.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nYes, I am very concerned with the way history is being taught. When looking at the curriculum, our history classes are always being taught through a \u201clens.\u201d Students don\u2019t always need to be taught through the \u201clens\u201d of a minority to understand their struggles. History is exciting because we get to learn from those who came before us that have made us who we are today. Historical events are not always meant to have a happy ending. Much of our U.S. and world history is ugly and gruesome, but if we don\u2019t learn about these events in their entirety, we are doomed to repeat them. We need to stop \u201cdumbing down\u201d our history education. Our students deserve better, because our future deserves better.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nA book removed from a curriculum is not a banned book. A book removed from a school library is not a banned book. A book that is illegal to own, possess or distribute IS a banned book. Most of these books in question are meant for \u201cYoung Adults.\u201d I believe a young adult is someone 18-22 years old, no longer enrolled in high school. There are no \u201cYoung Adults\u201d enrolled at school, only minors. This is a family decision, and if a family deems these books appropriate for their child, then they are able to access them at the public library or bookstore. Protecting our children from sexually explicit books is not bad parenting, it is the opposite.",

I also believe that Baltimore\u2019s teachers are the most hard working, passionate and committed people on earth. I am running for Baltimore City School Board because I fully intend to influence and create policies that ensure our kids and teachers are prioritized fiscally and socially, allowing all of Baltimore to flourish as a result of producing talented, creative young people who will undoubtedly change the face of this planet for the better.\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nFor 17 years I\u2019ve built my career centering marginalized groups, working to drastically change the trajectory of the lives of students through education and technology. Recently, I spent six years at Google working to expand access to opportunities in tech for Black and brown students, including low-income students, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students. Formerly, I was a diversity recruiter for Teach for America after first serving as a high school social studies teacher in West Baltimore. I am a proud Baltimorean who vows to live and work in this amazing city to make the quality of life better for all children and families.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe honorable and late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Baltimore) is a public leader that I admire and someone who I have channeled when thinking about the impact I hope to have on the children and families of Baltimore City, and the world at-large. When I was in high school, I had the amazing opportunity to participate in a student brain trust hosted by Delegate Cummings where he welcomed the voices of youth in his community engagement strategy. His leadership has influenced the way I operate as a young leader, and if elected to the school board I will absolutely model my community engagement efforts after his \u2013 one where youth are at the center and where their voices are prioritized in every decision made.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue facing the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners is teacher recruitment and retention. Bringing in qualified educators and working to keep them in the classroom will require a drastic and radical commitment from the school board to significantly increase base salary for teachers with opportunities for achievable performance bonuses, offering a manageable workload with supportive administrators. When we center the experience of teachers, we know that our children will reap the benefits in very tangible, measured ways. I also want to ensure that every school staff person has access to free and quality mental health services as long as they are employed by BCPSS.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is a top priority for me and in order to best support teachers and students, an increase in mental health services is absolutely imperative. I would work to ensure that budget allocations prioritize the mental and behavioral health of all students, teachers, and families. I would also push for a stronger health and wellness curriculum with the hope of teaching students how to be better advocates for themselves. Finally, I would work to remove police officers from schools and instead use that budget to increase the presence of social workers and other mental health professionals.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nAs an undergraduate history major and former high school social studies teacher, I believe that the way history is taught in city schools is appropriate, but has room for improvement. I would like to have more resources that center the students that we serve, including using resources specifically reflecting the lived experiences of marginalized groups throughout history. Critical race theory is very much part of that narrative.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nAbsolutely not.

    "content": "Campaign email: scanlanforeducation@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.scanlanforeducation.com\nAge: 68\nEmployment: Retired.\nEducation: Master of Science; Western Maryland College/McDaniel College\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nI am running for the Board of Education to bring reason and community back to our school system. Education starts in the classroom, and excellence is achieved when great educators interact with children in a safe and orderly learning environment. I have three top priorities. First, we must focus on our students in the classroom to fill learning gaps and get back to on-grade-level instruction. Secondly, we must attract and retain a highly qualified staff through competitive salaries in a supportive work environment. Finally, it is imperative we bring our schools back as community centers where families can come together to celebrate their schools and their neighborhoods.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a retired classroom teacher with 33 years of experience in Carroll County Public Schools. I started out as an English teacher and became a high school Reading Specialist who is also ESOL certified. I have worked with every academic level, but as a Reading Specialist I worked with some of the most vulnerable students. Whether it is those with disabilities or those living in poverty, we must meet the needs of every student. As a parent and a career educator, I understand what is needed to ensure our students are college and career ready. We must focus on learning and excellence. As a school system, we must provide our students every advantage to succeed and achieve their goals.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nOne public leader I admire is Jimmy Carter, not because of his presidency but because of what he has accomplished since then. The Carter Center has a far-reaching world health program. Combatting and eradicating the Guinea Worm, river blindness and malaria are just three of the many initiatives worldwide. Besides maternal and child health, they also advocate for mental health awareness here in the United States. Into his 90s, Carter has volunteered with Habitat for Humanity and taught Sunday school classes at his hometown church. Working toward world peace by monitoring democratic elections in 39 countries is another important enterprise of the Carter Center.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nOne of the many pressing issues we face is low morale and burnout of our staff. The last two years were incredibly taxing on our educators. From learning loss due to the pandemic to the unprecedented levels of emotional and behavioral issues of students, administrators and teachers feel overwhelmed and underappreciated. Teaching is a hard job. Educators work far more hours in a day than many people know, and it can be emotionally draining. First, we must show our educators respect. Let them do their jobs without questioning their motives. More importantly, we need to listen to them because they are the ones on the front lines. Second, teachers must be compensated as professionals.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSchool safety is always a concern in our world today. Carroll County, in partnership with the Sheriff\u2019s Department, has an excellent SRO program. The (school resource) officers are hand-picked and trained to work in our schools as partners. They are trusted and respected by students and staff alike. Additionally, mental health awareness and access are crucial to maintaining safe schools. We need more mental health counselors available for our students. The final component is creating a culture of kindness and acceptance in each school so students feel safe and valued. School-wide programs and peer-to-peer programs like Sources of Strength are very effective.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nPart of my job as a reading specialist was to push into US History and Government classes, so I have seen the textbooks and lessons firsthand. The lessons and texts are objective, and our teachers are professionals. My only concern is the amount of content our teachers need to cover in such a limited time frame. Much of the Government class is preparation for the Government High School Assessment which tests basic knowledge of how government functions. In US History, students learn an overview of our nation\u2019s past. There is not enough time to get into too much depth, so the focus is on the major events and eras in US history.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nAn important part of the Media Specialist\u2019s job is to build a library collection that meets the needs of their school\u2019s community, so that will be different for every school. It is literally impossible for the media specialist to read every book in the collection; consequently, they must rely on professional journals, reviews, and recommendations when building a library. Sometimes a book is selected that is not appropriate for the collection, and as a professional they may pull that book from circulation. While some sensitive books may require parental permission to check out, there is no place for racist or sexually explicit material in a school library.",

    "summary": "Amy Dodson, a 47-year-old business graduate from Chowan University, is running for the school board to advocate for children with special needs and ensure all students' success, drawing on her personal experience as a parent of three public school children and her husband\u2019s insight as a teacher. She admires Dolly Parton for her philanthropic efforts and believes that fully staffing schools with qualified individuals is crucial to addressing various issues facing the school board.",
    "content": "Campaign email: amydod1@yahoo.com\nAge: 47\nEducation: Bachelor\u2019s Degree, Business, Chowan University.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nThere were several factors that motivated me to take this step. Just one of those being I have a child with Down Syndrome, and I feel that children with special needs need a voice at the board level. I am able to take the time to advocate for my children. Not all parents are able to do that for a number of reasons. I am willing to take up that mantel and work for all children in our county.\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am extremely invested in the success of our schools, as I have three children that attend public schools here in our county. Not all candidates have ever utilized public school for their own children. I am also an advocate for students with IEPs (individualized education programs) and students in the special needs community. I have experience in both areas and I am willing to work for all students in that category and all students in general. My husband is a teacher in a neighboring county, and his insight into how to best support our educators is valuable. Finally, I am endorsed by the local Talbot County Education Association.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nThere are so many answers. I think Dolly Parton is a national treasure. She does so much for children in our county with her free book program, Imagination Library. She also has funded relief for wildfires in Tennessee as well as offering to pay for higher education for employees of her Dollywood park. She is an example of leading with her heart to truly care for other people.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThis is a tough question because I feel we have many issues. Behavior issues, vaping and others are on my list. But in order to successfully run schools we have to have schools fully staffed with qualified individuals. One does not have to look far to know we have a nationwide teacher shortage. We need to ensure we are retaining our qualified teachers as well as recruiting new teachers. We need to make sure we are supporting these teachers so they will want to stay. We need to appeal to all that our beautiful county has to offer in recruiting new teachers.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nYes, after Uvalde how can you not have concerns? The school system rightfully keeps the security plans under wraps to keep them secure. I would want to review the current plan before considering what changes may or may not be needed. I have worked in the safety industry my entire career and have numerous contacts that specialize in safety both at the federal and private level.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI do not currently have a concern. I would need to do a deep dive into the current curriculum, above what I already know. However, the curriculum is given to the schools from the State Board of Education.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI am not a fan of book banning in general.",

    "content": "Campaign email: espositoforboard@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.ashleyesposito.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/espositoforbaltimore\nAge: 38\nEmployment: Front end developer for a consulting company.\nEducation: Bachelor of Science, Software Development & Security, University of Maryland Global Campus.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI am running because my son is a future Baltimore City Public School student. I have been actively involved in advocating against permanent school closures, democratizing our school board and ending the school-to-prison pipeline. I am a former foster care youth and someone with learning differences. I felt a sense of urgency to bring my lived experience and parent voice to the school board. I believe we can have healthy communities if we strengthen our public school system. I know the community school model can work and believe our school system should move from a \u201cwhole child approach\u201d to a \u201cwhole family approach\u201d.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI would be a great school board member because of my lived experience and experience serving on other boards and councils. In council and board work, I have worked very hard to democratize decision-making processes, improving community engagement, and focusing on mental health policy in education. I am someone who doesn\u2019t shy away from tough conversations. I think that when you focus on the biggest issues being raised by the community you improve morale and create better policies.\u00a0\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI cannot pick just one leader. The leaders I admire are the grassroots community leaders. Sometimes they do not have a title, are unpaid and do not get recognition. I truly admire these leaders because they see an issue and take on doing the thankless work to improve conditions for everyone.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI believe the biggest issue facing our school board is morale. I think the public is losing faith in the direction of our school system. I have seen parents, students, and teachers raise valid issues. I think the public is coming to the table with good faith and sometimes there is a disconnect in leadership to lean into those uncomfortable conversations. I see people who are unwilling to admit there is a problem publicly and meet with the public. I believe the best way to improve this is to include stakeholders in decision-making processes. I know these issues are tough but if we work together we can fix them.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am very concerned about school safety! Our schools are not immune to issues that affect our communities. Whether it is mental health, substance use, gun violence, poverty, or other trauma, we have to have the resources to address all of these issues in the school system. We know these are issues impacting students outside of the school building so we need to be equipped to address them in the school building.\u00a0 I think we need to give every student access to resources. We need to train our staff and have our school system commit to trauma-informed care initiatives. All of these are barriers to our students\u2019 participation in the classroom.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nI think we are headed in the right direction for history curriculum. Over the years we have become more inclusive.\u00a0 My concerns are the efforts to make our history curriculum less inclusive and less historically accurate. I would like to see more local history in our school curriculum. I know there are so many contributions of local artists and dance in our city\u2019s history that should be included.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not believe in banning books. I believe censorship is a slippery slope and I have seen efforts to ban books actually lead to students seeking out those banned books. I think we should be encouraging literacy and critical thinking. I know for myself, books have sparked tough and healing conversations. Getting uncomfortable and challenging yourself and your perception of the world is a healthy process.",

    "content": "Campaign email: james.millerccpsboe@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.miller4ccpsboe.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Miller4CCPSBOE/\nAge: 39\nEmployment: Johns Hopkins \u2013 Senior Director, Finance\n\u00a0Education: MBA, Finance \u2013 Loyola University Maryland\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst and foremost, I am a parent. I have three beautiful daughters who attend Carroll County Public Schools. I believe a strong family foundation builds confident children, and confident children can change the world. If we have learned anything through the pandemic, parents deserve a voice in their children\u2019s education. I am a parent who fought hard to ensure my kids had a chance to attend school, mask optional. It is something I am proud of and, if elected, I will ensure parents have a voice in their children\u2019s education.\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nWe need a diverse board in order to have thoughtful discussion as to how we move forward and keep Carroll County schools the best in the state. I have spent my entire career in health care finance. I am currently a senior director of finance for a large health care system here in Maryland. I believe my background will be advantageous as we work with a tight budget, year in and year out. Currently, 88% of the CCPS budget is allotted toward salaries and benefits. It will be important that the next board has a strong finance background to ensure every tax dollar allocated to CCPS by the county commissioners is spent wisely.\u00a0\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nI would say local (state legislative) delegation Justin Ready, Haven Shoemaker, Susan Krebs and April Rose. They have always put Carroll County first in Annapolis and fight hard for our county to have a voice. I also applaud their efforts during COVID to get our schools open and push back on the state\u2019s endless mandates. Without their efforts I am not sure we would have opened schools or allowed mask optional when we did in Carroll County.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nWe need to focus on academics that are age-appropriate and get back to education. Even after two years of successful summer learning, our students are still recovering from learning loss. Closing that gap and creating confident students fosters lifelong learning.\nAdditionally, the state\u2019s restorative justice policy has gone too far to protect bullies at the expense of our students receiving a quality education. I will work with the MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) to change the state\u2019s policies and give power back to local school districts to hold bullies accountable for their actions. No kid should be scared to go to school and face endless bullying.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nCarroll County has a tremendous partnership with the sheriff\u2019s department to ensure our schools are safe for our children. I would like to see the SRO program expanded so schools don\u2019t have to share resource officers. More importantly, we need to focus on ensuring our kids have the support necessary to keep them from getting to a point where they want to hurt themselves or someone else. Focus on identifying students who are struggling and intervening early. As mentioned earlier we also need to hold bullies accountable so our kids can go to school free of the fear of being bullied.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe we do a very good job teaching history in CCPS. I want to ensure that continues if elected. I believe it is important we teach history as it occurred so our kids can learn from who occurred, good and bad. Part of why we teach history is so we learn from the past; continue the positive and not repeat the mistakes.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nBooks need to be age-appropriate. I find this question interesting as it gets asked a lot. Many people are quick to judge when books get removed from schools however, this has been going on for years. There is already a long list of books that are not allowed in schools and I believe we must continue to monitor what is being presented in our schools to ensure they are age-appropriate. Removing inappropriate books from schools is nothing new yet, for some reason it has become a hot topic of late.",

To restore parent/teacher control over what our children are learning and when they learn it. To store the ability to think critically about facts and circumstances instead of reacting from emotions. Schools are currently creating children who can\u2019t cope with the world because they are being taught to be guided by their emotions.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\nI\u2019ve been advocating for parent and student rights in education for over a decade.

There is too much focus on emotions, sexuality, racial division and political activism. I want to remove all of that from the classroom. These are family topics of discussion, not government school discussions. Government has no place teaching its preferred ideologies. As a matter of fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s illegal.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI\u2019m extremely concerned. Restorative justice has removed the ability to properly discipline students. Restoring consequences for bad behavior is a priority.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t teach history without infusing emotions and racial bias, that\u2019s very concerning. Children graduate not knowing we are a country founded on Judeo-Christian principals. We teach them to believe America was founded on slavery and white supremacy. That should bother every parent and taxpayer funding those lies.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes I believe certain books have no place in a school library. We recently got \u201cGender Queer\u201d removed from one of our school libraries. It\u2019s not just vulgar, it meets the federal definition of \u201cpornography.\u201d",

The fact that for the first time Baltimore City is electing representatives on the school board will break the bonds of silence. The elected representatives have a duty that cannot be stifled.

This fire that is constantly getting hotter is the fire of culture and climate. This needs to be looked at through the mirror of the culture and climate from which our students hale.

The precarious thing about teaching history is that we are all looking at it from one historical perspective or another. Very rarely is it taught with the objectivity and lack of bias that allows young scholars to freely form their own perspectives.\u00a0 The prevailing trends are carried in the heart of the curriculum, and the result is just mimicking of those presumed facts. History should be taught in a wide open exploratory fashion to help in the formation of young scholars perspectives of the past that will lead to their actions tomorrow.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nNever.",

I feel it is important to have a parent perspective on education for our children. I have worked in the private sector, and see firsthand what our children are not being taught to be productive citizens in the real world. As parents, we hear about our children being career and college ready. We really need to do just that by making sure our children know how to read, write, and understand math. I have served almost four year now. I voted to modernize our Career & Technology Center, voted to replace East Middle School, and hired our new superintendent.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nQueen Elizabeth. I know she was not an American, but she served to the best of her ability, and put the people of her country first.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nOur students are dealing with so many social issues, and much of that is due to social media. I have addressed our current Bring Your Own Device policy, and it will be discussed more in October. I also want to make sure we are advocating continuously about appropriate social media behaviors. This will also require help from our community to show good online behavior as well. The old saying still remains true, if you can\u2019t say something nice don\u2019t say anything at all.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nCarroll County Public Schools has done an incredible job implementing school safety regulations from the State of Maryland. We have an amazing partnership with the Carroll County Sheriff\u2019s Office, as well as our elected law enforcement leader, Sheriff Jim DeWees. Our SRO (school resource officer) program is one that has had national recognition. Our SRO\u2019s are valued and appreciated in our schools, and make connections with our students.\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are some concerns, but those are on a case-by-case basis. All history should be taught. The good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful. Opinion about history do not belong in the classroom, only the facts.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed? \u00a0\nAll material should be age-appropriate. A kindergarten age child should not be taught about sex, sex acts, or to question who they are. Movies have ratings. Music has ratings. Video games have ratings. Schools would not show a Rated R movie in middle school. All curriculum should be age-appropriate and previewed by groups that include parents before displayed or taught.",

These are family topics of discussion, not government school discussions. Government has no place teaching its preferred ideologies.

Children graduate without knowing that we are a country founded on Judeo-Christian principles. We teach them to believe America was founded on slavery and white supremacy.

Allow students to understand that with history, decisions were made based on what was known and practiced at a particular time or period and how those events influenced where we are today. We don\u2019t need to segregate history based on race. We can teach history as a subject that allows the students to discern and apply critical thinking skills to determine the outcomes of past actions and how you can take what was learned in the past, apply it to today and how history helps us to make better decisions for today and future generations.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nAny book that contains pornographic pictures and content.

Teachers can make significantly more if they go to Montgomery County, which touches our county or more if they go to Howard County, which also touches our county border. This has been a significant issue for a long time.\u201d\n\u00a0In May, Montgomery County Public Schools gave their staff a 6% increase in salaries, citing the raise as an effort to help attract new staff and retain current teachers.\nIn Anne Arundel County, the Baltimore County pact is particularly significant.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are preparing to begin our negotiations in a few weeks,\u201d said Nicole Disney-Bates, president of the Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are prepared to continue to have conversations with the superintendent, board of education members, county council, county executive and the community at large as to the best ways to continue to attract and retain teachers in Anne Arundel County.\u201d\nBaltimore County\u00a0 teachers paid close attention to other counties\u2019 pay scales and working conditions during their months-long negotiations.\u00a0 They knew they wanted salaries comparable to the counties that were luring their teachers away, said Cindy Sexton, president of the Teachers Association of Baltimore County.\n\u201cWe know people are leaving Baltimore County,\u201d Sexton said.\u201cTeachers are looking and saying, \u2018Oh, I can make more in Howard [County],\u2019 and then potentially going there.\u201d\n\n\nThe new compensation package includes a 3% cost-of-living pay increase for all staff members, mid-year step increases, retention bonuses for all staff and additional bonuses for the school employees with 30 or more years of service.\nDuring a press conference to announce the agreement, Baltimore County Executive John Olszewski said retaining teachers was an impetus for the agreement now.\n\u201cEducation has been and will continue to be our top priority in Baltimore County,\u201d Olszewski said. \u201dI am proud that we were able to come together to announce well-deserved pay raises for our hardworking educators and support employees.\u201d\nTeacher retention is a major concern for Maryland school systems.

Other states have also sought to increase pay to retain their teachers. Alabama lawmakers, for example, passed a series of measures aimed at providing significant bonuses and financial incentives.\u00a0\nSome states have taken dramatic measures to ensure that there are enough educators.\nIn Texas and Arkansas, school districts have decided to embrace four-day school weeks to save on operations and staffing costs.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS \u2013 Arianna Dastvan remembers using her birthday money as a child to buy an overhead projector for her bedroom. There, she would emulate the teachers she admired as she instructed her stuffed animals.\nDastvan recalled how she would stay late and arrive early, so she could assist her elementary school teachers with their work. She loved being in the classroom.\nSo, she became a teacher, but six years into her career, Dastvan, 31, quit her job with the Baltimore County Public Schools.\n\u201cI had an emotional breakdown from being so disrespected by students and parents that one day, I was just like, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d Dastvan said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019\u201d\nScores of Maryland public school teachers are saying the same thing, and their departures are creating shortages throughout the state\u2019s education system.\nIn the last academic school year, 9.1% of Maryland teachers left the profession altogether, according to the state department of education. Consequently, at the beginning of this year, county school systems across the state reported hundreds of teacher vacancies they needed to fill.\n\nIn an effort to quickly staff classrooms and retain teachers, some school districts are raising wages.\nBaltimore County Public Schools announced a pay package on Tuesday, which includes a 3% \u201ccost-of-living increase for all staff members retroactive to July 1\u201d and retention bonuses for teachers. In May, Montgomery County Public Schools gave their staff a 6% increase in salaries, citing the raise as an effort to help attract new staff and \u201cencourage (staff) to stay with us,\u201d said Monifa McKnight, superintendent for MCPS.\n\u201cTeachers have long known their profession is a difficult job. How many professions, for instance, expect their employees to pay for most of the materials they need to do their job?\nThey work through long hours for relatively low pay, administrative red tape and summers spent preparing for the upcoming school year.\nNow, after two years of hybrid learning, social distancing, masked-up teaching and the associated anxiety, many Maryland teachers are burned out and are leaving, either to early retirement or in search of a new career.\nThe teacher exodus, according to a survey this year of 1,324 teachers, appears to be the result of \u201ca deep disillusionment of many teachers who feel overworked, underpaid, and under-appreciated.\u201d\nThe Merrimack College Teacher Survey, which was commissioned by the Winston School of Education and Social Policy at Merrimack conducted by the nonprofit EdWeek Research Center, found that in the last 11 years, the percentage of teachers who believe the community treats them with professionalism has dropped from 77% to only 46%.\nJust 12% of teachers, the survey found, were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their jobs. Additionally, more than four in ten said they were \u201cfairly likely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to leave the profession in the next two years.\nConsequently, the study concluded, the flow of teachers leaving the profession have the \u201cpotential implications for a once-in-a-generation shift in the teaching profession.\u201d\nDonna Christy, president of the Prince George\u2019s County Education Association, agrees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst it has ever been right now,\u201d Christy told the Capital News Service. \u201cWe\u2019re at the tipping point. It\u2019s either make it or break it. I don\u2019t see anything that says we are going to make it. So, it looks like it\u2019s going to break.\u201d\nDastvan taught math at Golden Ring Middle School in Rosedale for five years.\nDastvan said she was sexually assaulted by a Golden Ring student in 2019. Dastvan said she reported the assault to the school\u2019s administration, but she did not receive the support she expected.\nJanelle Brubach, a former Baltimore County public school teacher, now works as a Realtor for RE/MAX in Fallston. Brubach left teaching in March 2022 after 14 \u00bd years. Her doctor would not medically release her back to the classroom due to job-related anxiety attacks. (Ron Harris/Capital News Service)\u201c\u2018Ms. Dastvan, what do you expect?\u2019\u201d she said was the gist of the response. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s just a 12-year-old boy.\u2019 That was the final straw for me. I transferred that year.\u201d\nShe said she transferred to General John Stricker Middle School in Dundalk.\nAfter two months at the new school, Dastvan said she suffered a mental breakdown. She said she checked herself into Sheppard Pratt Adult Day Hospital and received outpatient care for a month and half.\nFollowing treatment she returned to teaching, just as the coronavirus pandemic began. Like teachers across the country, she transitioned to remote teaching. Dastvan decided to leave teaching and resigned in August 2020.\nShe now works remotely for Realestaged, a furniture staging company for real estate agencies. Dastvan says she loves her job now, where she can complete her work from the comfort of her home with her dog by her side.\nValerie Coll spent 32 years teaching elementary students in the Montgomery County Public School system before retiring in 2021.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most important job in the world,\u201d Coll, 62, said. \u201cWhat kept me (teaching) is that you knew everyday something happened in the course of the day for you or for some or all of the children, that there was a point in the day where everything was where it needed to be.\u201d\nColl retired early and decided to run in the upcoming election for the Montgomery School Board of Education, she said, so she could impact the decisions that affect educators.\nShe said one of the most difficult things affecting teachers are decisions made about the classroom by non educators who do not understand the differing needs of every classroom.\n\u201cIf I'm working in a kindergarten classroom, the amount of time that I'm actually given to make sure that the children in front of me have the space and the time to progress, instead of being shoved onto the next thing, that's a challenge,\u201d Coll said.\n\u201cAnd that's a challenge that comes because people who are not in the classroom are determining exactly what you should be doing over the course of a field of study or over the course of a week or over the course of how you simply teach reading. And that's not realistic, and it's especially not realistic, I think, with the current numbers (of students) we have.\u201d\nJanelle Brubach, taught middle school with Dastvan at General John Stricker. Brubach left the Baltimore County Public Schools system after 14 \u00bd years. She now sells houses as a Realtor for RE/MAX.\nBrubach said she was injured while attempting to separate a school fight in November 2021. Afterwards, she said, she began to suffer anxiety attacks associated with teaching. Ultimately, she said, her doctor refused to medically release her back to the classroom.\n\u201cEvery time I would go into the office, and we would talk about my return back into the classroom, I physically would break out in hives, and my neck would turn beet red at just the thought of going back,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe workload of teachers, especially through COVID was unbelievable, and it's just a thankless job,\u201d Brubach said. \u201cI was basically in charge of all the sixth grade discipline (before COVID). So, kids were being sent to my room yet I'm still expected to teach.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no support from administration for the amount of discipline I was handling and then parents were another level of cussing you out, and it's all your fault.

    "summary": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, higher education enrollment in the U.S., including Maryland, saw a significant drop, reversing the historical trend of increased enrollment during economic downturns. National undergraduate enrollment declined by 8% since 2019, with community colleges experiencing an even more dramatic decline.",
    "content": "Undergraduate and graduate enrollment in public four-year universities has decreased during the pandemic and community college enrollment has seen an even more dramatic decline. As the pandemic led to financial uncertainty across the country and caused colleges to make changes to class delivery, student life and other services, students were enrolling at lower rates. \n\n \n\nHistorically, times of economic hardship result in increased enrollment in higher education in America, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). At least since the 1980s recession, Maryland\u2019s public four-year institutions have generally followed this trend. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland and the rest of the country saw a drastic decline in higher education enrollment.\nDuring recessions, higher education enrollment generally increases as unemployment rates rise, according to the NBER. Teenagers and young adults especially gravitate toward college during economic hardship due to scarce employment opportunities. \n\n \n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the country\u2019s economy entered a recession and unemployment spiked. Unlike previous economic downturns, college enrollment also declined drastically as classes moved online and students and their families faced financial uncertainty.\nAccording to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (NSCRC), national undergraduate enrollment has seen an 8% drop since 2019. \nThe drop, however, is not out of the blue \u2014 college enrollment has been on the decline nationwide since 2011, according to NSCRC. Maryland\u2019s public four-year institutions deviated from this trend however; undergraduate enrollment only decreased two times between 2011 and 2019. In fact, 2014 saw a jump of over 9,000 undergraduate students. Graduate enrollment was on a very slight decline during that time. \nIn fall 2021, enrollment continued to decline. Unemployment dropped to pre-pandemic levels, and students started \u201cquestioning the value of college,\u201d said Doug Shapiro, the executive research director for NSCRC, in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\u201cThey may be looking at friends who graduated last year or the year before who didn\u2019t go, and they seem to be doing fine. They\u2019re working; their wages are up,\u201d he said.\nDespite an overall decline in enrollment in Maryland higher education, the changes varied among the state\u2019s public four-year institutions. \n\n \n\nWithin the University System of Maryland (USM), eight of the 11 universities saw a decline in undergraduate enrollment in the fall of 2020, and seven saw a decline the following year. \nWhile undergraduate enrollment fell only slightly in fall of 2020, it dropped 3.44% in fall 2021. USM graduate enrollment deviated from the national trend by decreasing both years; they dropped more significantly in fall 2020 but had a smaller decline in fall 2021. \nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), saw a significant difference between undergraduate and graduate enrollment: while the number of undergraduate students dropped both years, the number of graduate students went up. In fall of 2021, graduate enrollment increased by 9.28% \u2014 the biggest uptick out of the 11 graduate schools. \nUMBC Director of Communications and Content Strategy Dinah Winnick wrote in an email that \u201c[d]espite the complications from the worldwide pandemic,\u201d students are applying to graduate school programs in \u201crecord numbers.\u201d\nOther universities saw large declines in graduate enrollment. Salisbury University saw a 10.7% decline in graduate enrollment in 2021. Their undergraduate enrollment also fell, resulting in a 13% decrease overall since 2019. \nAllen Koehler, Salisbury University\u2019s Assistant Vice President of Enrollment Management, said that this was a big hit for Salisbury, especially considering the 2020 fall cohort was a highly anticipated class for the university.\n\u201cThe class that was for fall [2020], where COVID hit midway through the recruitment cycle, \u2026 was trending to be our largest class in over a decade,\u201d he said. \nCommunity colleges have faced even worse declines during the pandemic. The pandemic worsened an existing trend, where community college enrollment was on the decline for years. \n\n \n \nNationwide, community college enrollment dropped by 10% in 2020, according to NSCRC. In 2021, it continued dropping but at a slower rate. In Maryland, community colleges saw the inverse: enrollment dropped slightly (4.8%) in 2020, with a much steeper decline (9.8%) in 2021.\nAfter reaching a peak increase during the Great Recession, community colleges in Maryland began declining in 2012, which is in line with the national trend.\nAs the end of the 2021-22 school year approaches, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents will hold a meeting this month and discuss enrollment projections for the fall.",

    "summary": "A recent poll reveals that despite its 50-year history, Title IX remains largely unknown to most secondary school students and their parents, with significant disparities in awareness among different demographic groups. Despite this lack of knowledge, a majority of respondents support equal treatment for boys' and girls' sports teams, though many are hesitant to report potential violations of the law.",
    "content": "Title IX is 50 years old, but a poll has found that nearly three-quarters of secondary school students and nearly 60% of parents said they know \u201cnothing at all\u201d about the landmark civil rights law meant to ensure gender equity in education, including athletics.\nThe poll, conducted by Ipsos for The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland, found that parents and students overwhelmingly agreed that boys and girls teams should receive equal treatment. \nMore than 3.4 million girls and almost 4.6 million boys play high school sports.\n\nOnly a third of the people polled said they believe that equal opportunities exist in high school athletics across the U.S. But in their own schools, parents and students judged the situation to be much better, the poll found: About two-thirds said boys and girls had equal opportunities there.\nBeyond finding that a majority of parents lack knowledge of Title IX, the poll highlighted some differences among groups. Of male parents, 54% said they knew nothing about Title IX, compared to 62% of female parents. Nearly 80% of respondents with no college degree answered that they knew nothing about the law. That compared to 47% with a college degree.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nEnforcement of Title IX largely relies on students and parents to report unfair treatment or unequal athletic opportunities, but many poll respondents expressed reluctance to speak up about potential violations.\nIn response to the poll results, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary of the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education, said in a statement: \u201cWhile we have made tremendous progress, there is more work to do to build educational environments free from discrimination and to educate the public on how important this law is.\u201d\nMost parents polled did not know whether their children\u2019s school had a procedure for handling Title IX complaints.\nThe online poll of 1,008 parents and 506 children ages 12-17 now enrolled in school was conducted from March 18 to 28.\nUnder Title IX, all federally funded schools with athletics programs must provide equal opportunities and treatment in areas such as practice facilities, coaching and publicity. The majority of poll respondents answered \u201cunsure\u201d to questions that tested their knowledge about Title IX\u2019s application and enforcement, such as whether the law covers all educational programs that receive federal funding (it does) and who can report Title IX violations (anyone).\nParents who said their children played sports differed little from other parents in their knowledge of Title IX.\nAmong respondents who had some familiarity with Title IX, most said their knowledge came from sources other than school officials or materials. Half of parents who knew about Title IX said they saw, heard or read about it online.\nStudents were somewhat more likely than their parents to learn about Title IX from school personnel. One-third said they saw, heard or read about the law online and 29% said their information came from a school coach or official.\n\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing all aspects of Title IX. But its main enforcement mechanism relies on young athletes or their parents to know their rights, recognize violations and file a formal complaint with the federal agency. \nAbout half of students and parents agreed that it was their responsibility to report a Title IX violation if they were aware of one, but many said they were unlikely to or uncertain about speaking up to the relevant officials. \nOnly a quarter of parents said they would consider submitting a complaint to the federal Department of Education, while 38% said they likely would not consider it and 34% said they didn\u2019t know.\n\nParents were more likely to consider submitting a complaint to school personnel than to the federal government, but fewer than six in 10 parents said they would consider raising an issue with any kind of school official. A quarter of parents said they would not take any action if they witnessed a sports-related Title IX violation.\n\nParents who said they would be uncomfortable reporting a Title IX violation directly to their child\u2019s school were largely concerned about negative repercussions for their child, the poll found. For students, too, fear of retaliation at school and negative reactions from peers were the biggest causes of reluctance.\n\nView the University of Maryland/Ipsos \u2013 Title IX Poll:\nTopline\nCross tab 1\nCross tab 2\nCross tab 3",

    "summary": "The U.S. Department of Education's data on high school sports participation is unreliable and often overstates girls' involvement while ignoring some boys, making it difficult to assess Title IX compliance without complaints from athletes or parents.",
    "content": "As the agency responsible for enforcing Title IX, the U.S. Department of Education collects data that should show whether high schools are providing equal athletic opportunities to girls and boys. Except it doesn\u2019t.\nInstead, the data the department gathers from school districts ignores some athletes \u2014 mostly boys \u2014 and often overstates girls\u2019 participation in sports.\nAs a result, 50 years after the passage of Title IX, it\u2019s still impossible to tell whether high schools are complying with the law unless someone complains. That burden usually falls to teenage athletes and their parents, who often aren\u2019t aware of their rights under Title IX.\nIn a number of cases, figures collected by the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights are incomplete and differ substantially from statistics kept by school districts, an analysis by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland shows.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nThe discrepancy seems to come largely from the office\u2019s narrow definition of sports participation. Officials at several Maryland school districts, for example, said they don\u2019t report complete counts of their athletes to the federal government because the survey asks only for a count of athletes on single-sex teams. Mixed teams \u2014 including football teams with one girl \u2014 are not included.\nIn an email response to the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 findings, a Department of Education spokesperson said the public should not use its data alone to draw conclusions about Title IX compliance. He also said the department uses its data \u201cin conjunction with other information and factors to investigate and enforce civil rights laws.\u201d\nElizabeth Kristen is project director and senior staff attorney at Fair Play for Girls in Sports, a project of Legal Aid at Work that provides legal services to low-income families. She said that in high school Title IX cases she litigated outside Maryland, she\u2019d seen that federal data didn\u2019t reflect on-the-ground disparities. But she never knew why.\nWhen told about the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 findings, Kristen called the Office for Civil Rights\u2019 exclusion of coed sports bizarre. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting accurate information to help them enforce Title IX if they\u2019re not collecting information about all of the athletic participants,\u201d she said.\nThe office\u2019s data comes from a survey that the agency describes as a \u201clongstanding and important aspect\u201d of administering and enforcing civil rights statutes. Under Title IX, schools are required to provide athletic opportunities in numbers that mirror each gender\u2019s proportion of enrollment.\nThe Povich and Howard centers analyzed athletics participation at the 20 Maryland public school districts that provided usable data and found that, in all but four cases, federal data describes a more favorable situation for female athletes than what the districts\u2019 own records show.\n\nIn fact, at about 40% of districts, federal data indicates that when compared to their proportion of enrollment, girls outnumber boys in sports. But schools\u2019 own data tells a different story: All districts have fewer opportunities for female athletes.\nIn the large suburban district of Baltimore County, for example, federal data paints a picture of sports fields teeming with female athletes. The Office for Civil Rights\u2019 public website says that, as of the 2017-18 school year, girls comprised 49% of enrollment in the district and 72% of athletes \u2014 making girls overrepresented in sports by 23 percentage points.\nBut the district\u2019s in-house athletics data, which the Povich and Howard centers obtained through a public records request, says that girls actually comprised 44% of athletes, meaning they were underrepresented in sports by about five percentage points.\nThat\u2019s one of several districts where the office\u2019s instructions to count only single-sex sports teams distort the image of proportionality.\nIn Calvert County, a district spokesperson said its 2017-18 federal data submission did not include football, golf, wrestling, baseball and tennis because those sports were coed. According to district data, that means 616 boys and 54 girls were not counted. Federal data suggests girls are overrepresented in sports by six percentage points, but district data shows they are underrepresented by the same amount.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting every athlete. Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u2014Peg Pennepacker, Title IX consultant and former high school athletics administrator\n\nWhen presented with the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 findings, Title IX advocates said they were puzzled and flummoxed by the federal government\u2019s exclusion of coed sports.\nPeg Pennepacker, a longtime athletics administrator who now consults with high schools on Title IX compliance, said that\u2019s not how she conducts athletics audits. \u201cI\u2019m counting every athlete,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nA change could be coming. Proposed revisions to the 2021-22 survey would remove the single-sex distinction from the federal data collection. But the shift would only apply to new data, and those numbers would not be public for a few years.\nIn the meantime, Terry Fromson, managing attorney for the Philadelphia-based Women\u2019s Law Project, said the available federal data isn\u2019t fulfilling its purpose. \u201cIt isn\u2019t making it easier for students or their families to find out if their children are being treated fairly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it should.\u201d\nSchools required to count, but only to count some\nSince 2000, the Office for Civil Rights has required K-12 schools to submit data on various programs, including athletics, through the Civil Rights Data Collection. The office describes the biennial data collection as part of its \u201coverall strategy for administering and enforcing\u201d civil rights laws such as Title IX. According to a Department of Education spokesperson, the office \u201cinitiated 12 investigations in the last decade based in part on CRDC athletics participation data.\u201d\nThe office also posts the data online, showing the gender breakdown of athletes side by side with enrollment percentages. The most recent data available is from the 2017-18 school year. (The latest data collection was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.)\nTitle IX advocates said that most students and parents don\u2019t know that they can check the office\u2019s data tool to see whether their schools are providing proportionate athletic opportunities. If they did, though, the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 analysis suggests that, in some cases, the data would not reflect equity gaps they see on their sports fields.\nThe Office for Civil Rights collects its data directly from schools, yet officials in many Maryland districts said they didn\u2019t know why the federal data doesn\u2019t match their own data. Those who had an explanation for the discrepancies pointed to the survey\u2019s instructions to only count single-sex athletics.\nRob Willoughby, supervisor of instruction and athletics at Caroline County Public Schools, was one of those officials. Last November, he logged into the submission system to complete the latest survey. As he scrolled, Willoughby had questions of his own.\nLike its predecessors since 2004, the 2020-21 Civil Rights Data Collection asked for the number of single-sex interscholastic sports at each school, the number of male and female teams and the number of female and male participants. The instructions said to \u201cInclude only interscholastic athletics in which only males or only females participate.\u201d\nWilloughby looked at the numbers for football. In the 2020-21 school year, no girls played on Caroline County\u2019s teams. But Willoughby had coached football during years when the roster included a girl. He was unsure whether to report the sport as single-sex or coed. \u201cIs it based on who actually participates?\u201d he wondered. \u201cOr the rules of who can participate?\u201d\nAccording to a 2020-21 data tip sheet for schools, when a girl participates on a predominantly male team, such as football or wrestling, the entire team should be excluded from the data. Since that can lead schools to exclude greater numbers of male athletes, it can result in the overall proportion of female athletes appearing higher than is the case.\nFor instance, if Caroline County\u2019s football players were omitted in the last data collection from 2017-18, it would mean that 135 boys \u2014 or 15% of the district\u2019s athletes \u2014 were not counted in the federal data.\nAdditionally, the exclusion of coed sports can mean that which teams get counted in a given district can change from survey to survey, since girls may participate in traditionally male sports one year and not others. That makes following trend lines difficult, Willoughby said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to me like they were collecting data to tell a story,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s difficult to know how school employees who complete the data collection interpret the single-sex athletics definition. Willoughby, who became athletics supervisor last year on top of another supervisory role, said that he tried clicking on a link in the instructions for more information about definitions, but it didn\u2019t work. He asked his director for guidance and tried Googling the subject.\nUltimately, he included football in Caroline County\u2019s 2020-21 totals since no girls had played that year. But he said it felt like a judgment call, and he didn\u2019t know if \u201cthe people who sat in this chair before me did it the same way.\u201d\n\nProposed changes in the count\nA fuller picture of athletic participation could be coming. In December, the Department of Education shared its proposed revisions for the next data collection, which would eliminate the single-sex athletics questions and ask schools for a tally of all male, female or nonbinary athletes.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Office for Civil Rights is aware of how the single-sex definition affected its past data. Documents in the Federal Register say that the proposed changes are intended \u201cto reduce the reporting burden on schools\u201d and lead to more accurate data on all athletes, \u201cregardless of gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what this all signals is just lost opportunity,\u201d\n\u2014Elizabeth Kristen, director, Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work\n\nKristen, the attorney who has litigated high school Title IX cases, said those revisions would be a positive step toward equipping schools and families to advance gender equity in sports. But she lamented that incomplete data has been the norm for so long. \u201cI think what this all signals is just lost opportunity,\u201d she said.\nKristen also said that the office could do more to educate schools and the public about the data. Pennepacker, the Title IX consultant who focuses on high school sports, agreed. She said the office could take its data \u201cand really turn it into something that could be very useful for schools and parents.\u201d\nBut school leaders might not appreciate a more complete view of high school sports participation being made public, Pennepacker said. \u201cTo be quite honest \u2026 I can see it being threatening to some schools, too, because it may expose inequities within their athletics program.\u201d\nOur original data analysis that produced facts included in this story is available for review in a data notebook.\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "content": "In Vista, California, heroes wear softball uniforms. Their names: Danielle Ellis and Sydney Prenatt.\nEllis and Prenatt resist such praise. But at Rancho Buena Vista High School, where the pair were teammates on the Longhorns softball team for four years before graduating in 2018, that\u2019s exactly how they\u2019re remembered.\n\u201cThey should absolutely be considered heroes. What they did was selfless and it\u2019s going to help so many girls in the future,\u201d said Ava Bradford, a former Rancho Buena Vista softball player.\nEllis\u2019 and Prenatt\u2019s story is rare. A four-month investigation of Title IX and high school sports by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found many high school girls lack the information to recognize Title IX violations and to demand change from school officials.\nNot Ellis and Prenatt.\nOn May 8, 2018, as teammates looked on, Ellis and Prenatt read a letter from the Vista Unified School District board. They learned that the board had approved a new softball field to be built on campus. They\u2019d won their fight for equal treatment.\n\u201cIt was a really powerful moment,\u201d Prenatt said. \u201cI almost started crying, just because it was really surreal.\u201d\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nThe senior softball players from the class of 2018 at Rancho Buena Vista High School stand with their coaches on the field. (Photo courtesy of Sydney Prenatt)\nAs seniors, the friends and teammates were students in a government class taught by Timothy Leary, a beloved figure at the school for 26 years. In the first unit of Leary\u2019s class, Ellis and Prenatt learned about the five concepts of democracy, specifically civil rights and the full extent of Title IX as it pertains to equal opportunity in sport. As they discussed the law and its purpose, a lightbulb went on about their softball field.\n\u201cSydney and I sat down and analyzed Title IX as a law. We\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this is a big deal. This is a very major issue,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe always noticed the differences and stuff, but we didn\u2019t realize that there was a law specifically that addressed that.\u201d\n\nWhat is Title IX?\nTitle IX is a federal law passed by Congress nearly 50 years ago. It prohibits sex-based discrimination at any school that receives funding from the federal government, including in sports programs. A four-month investigation by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland found that Title IX has fallen short of its promise for girls playing high school sports: They\u2019re stuck in an imperfect system that continues to favor boys in many ways.\n\nThere were many differences between the baseball field for boys and the softball field for girls. All favored the boys. The softball field was off campus at Buena Vista Park, where the girls played on the Buena Vista Ballfields about one-third mile from the school. The softball players also had to provide their own transportation, or walk.\nOther facilities were lacking. The field conditions were below average. The softball team\u2019s storage facilities did not match those for the baseball team. As a result, the players had to walk to their classes with their softball gear. The bathrooms at the park were also sometimes locked and there were instances when the athletes said they felt their privacy was being violated by passersby.\n\u201cIt just made us feel underappreciated and undervalued [by] the school,\u201d Ellis said.\nThe baseball diamond was far superior. It was on campus, had better field conditions, had a clubhouse to store gear, had access to the school bathrooms and had batting cages. The baseball team determined when it got to use the field.\nPrenatt explained that playing softball on a field in a public park owned by the city made it difficult to schedule games and practice, knowing other teams needed to use the field as well.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, it was so blatantly obvious, the unequalness,\u201d Prenatt said.\nAfter consulting with their government teacher, Ellis and Prenatt focused their yearlong class project on their softball field and Title IX. They approached the school principal in the fall to ask for help. He was not supportive, they said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew that we had to go to the school board,\u201d Ellis said.\nRancho Buena Vista government teacher Timothy Leary stands in front of his classroom. (Lee Anne McCollough)\nEllis and Prenatt contacted members of the Vista Unified School District board, leading to a tense conversation with the principal, Ellis said. (Attempts to contact the principal, who has since left the school, were unsuccessful).\nThe girls faced other roadblocks. But Ellis and Prenatt were not going to let each other stop short of their goal.\n\u201c[Danielle] and I were both firing each other up and saying, \u2018No, why would we stop because it\u2019s so blatantly an obvious violation,\u2019\u201d Prenatt said. \u201cWe also knew the softball team deserves better and our coaches deserve better. That\u2019s why we weren\u2019t really super discouraged by not hearing [what we want].\u201d\nThey decided to go to a school board meeting on April 12, 2018, after their softball game against Ramona High School. They were dressed in their uniforms when they gave a speech about their proposal for a new field.\n\u201cWe are asking you to all stand with us so that future girls don\u2019t have to grow up thinking equality has to be earned,\u201d Prenatt said during their speech to the school board. \u201cThey grow up believing that equality is expected.\u201d\nOn Leary\u2019s advice, they then made an emphatic gesture to get the attention of the school board.\n\n\u201cIt was a really great moment, and it really made us feel seen and it made me really happy for the future softball players. \u2026 It was a really powerful moment. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\n\u2014Sydney Prenatt, former softball player, Rancho Buena Vista High School, Vista California\n\n\u201cBasically, [Leary] told us \u2018if you really want to make a statement, right after you give your speech you just walk out,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did, we walked out, and then our teammates, our parents, everybody stood up and just walked out with us.\u201d\nAbout four weeks after the school board meeting, Ellis and Prenatt got the letter with the big news that the district was going to build a new softball field for Rancho Buena Vista High School.\n\u201cWe read the letter to our entire team and we all started jumping around and screaming,\u201d Prenatt said. \u201cIt was a really great moment, and it really made us feel seen and it made me really happy for the future softball players. \u2026 It was a really powerful moment. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new field at Rancho Buena Vista High School was held in February 2021. (Photo courtesy of Matt Doyle)\nThe new softball field, a part of Vista Unified\u2019s $247 million Measure LL Facility Bond Project, opened in February 2021. By then, Ellis and Prenatt had graduated.\nBut to Ellis and Prenatt, it was about the next generation of softball players having their own field to play on.\n\u201cThe goal was definitely just to get the girls coming after us a softball field on campus, something that was comparable to the baseball field,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThe biggest goal was just to do better by the next generation, to give them something more than we ever had.\u201d\nBradford, who was a freshman at the time of the school board meeting, was one of the softball players who got to play on the new field as a senior when it opened.\n\u201cWe have so much gratitude for what Sydney and [Danielle] did,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cJust to be able to have the opportunity to play on that field. I\u2019m just really grateful to have had my senior season there.\u201d\nEllis\u2019 and Prenatt\u2019s Title IX story lives on in Leary\u2019s government class when he teaches Title IX to his students.\n\u201cI use [Danielle] and Sydney in my class in my explanation every single year now,\u201d Leary said. \u201cWhat is so inspiring was that they were determined and this demonstrates what you can succeed and what you can achieve \u2026 when you don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "Title IX mandates equal publicity for girls' sports, but many schools, including Pentucket Regional High School, fail to meet this requirement, often giving more attention to boys' teams on social media and other platforms. This disparity sends a message of inequality, suggesting that girls' achievements are less valued, according to Elizabeth Kristen, director of the Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work.",
    "content": "If you\u2019d searched Pentucket Regional High School\u2019s Twitter account for school sports news five years ago, you\u2019d have come across many posts about the boys teams. Updates about the girls teams at the Massachusetts school were harder to find.\nFrom the beginning of the 2014-15 school year to early 2017, 26% of tweets from the school\u2019s athletics Twitter account covered girls team sports, according to an analysis by the region\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. When live game updates were tweeted, 60% of the updates were about boys teams and 32% were about girls teams.\nTitle IX requires equal opportunity for girls in school-based sports programs receiving federal financial assistance. That requirement extends to a category often overlooked by officials at many schools, including Pentucket Regional High School: publicity.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nPublicity covers a range of attention-grabbing promotion: social media, school news coverage, marquee announcements, pictures on the school athletics website, use of the cheerleaders and band \u2014 even trophies on display at the school.\nUnequal opportunities for publicity can vary widely. In Ball-Chatham Community Unit School District 5 in Chatham, Illinois, there were concerns over cheerleader and band attendance at boys and girls games. At Stephenville High School in Texas, the issue was equity in team nicknames.\n\n\u201cIf only male athletes are highlighted, girls get the message pretty quickly that they don\u2019t matter, that they\u2019re not as important, that their achievements are not valued.\u201d\n\u2014Elizabeth Kristen, director, Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work\n\n\u201cThis is really about the message of equality or inequality,\u201d said Elizabeth Kristen, director of the Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work. \u201cIf only male athletes are highlighted, girls get the message pretty quickly that they don\u2019t matter, that they\u2019re not as important, that their achievements are not valued.\u201d\nFor students in Chatham, unequal opportunity for publicity meant girls teams had less access to school cheerleaders, the band and the dance team, factors that contributed to a Title IX complaint filed against the Ball-Chatham Community Unit School District 5 with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights in 2019.\nAccording to the complaint, the cheer team at Glenwood High School performed at each home and away game for varsity football, varsity boys basketball and junior varsity boys basketball in the 2018-19 school year. The cheerleaders at home varsity football and boys basketball games were joined by the dance team, which performed before and at halftime. The band performed at all home varsity football games and varsity boys basketball games.\nHowever, girls teams played without such support. According to the complaint, the cheerleading, dance team and band only played at one home varsity girls basketball game during the 2018-19 school year.\nAndrea Beckford, an attorney and author of \u201cWe Need Equal Cheers for Boys and Girls: How the Absence of Cheerleaders at Women\u2019s Sporting Events Is a Violation of Title IX,\u201dsaid we\u2019ve been conditioned to associate cheerleaders with sports like football.\n\u201cTheoretically, cheerleading is just supporting a sports team; it should not matter, the gender of said sports team,\u201d Beckford said.\nDusty Burk, athletics director and Title IX coordinator for the Ball-Chatham School District, said that since the civil rights complaint in 2019, the school district has taken steps to ensure the cheer and dance teams perform at every girls and boys junior varsity and varsity home basketball game starting in the 2021-22 season.\n\u201cWe believe our changes will improve the experience for all students involved in athletics and extracurricular activities, and remain committed to looking for future opportunities to enhance equities between the sexes,\u201d Burk said.\nPublicity disparities in social media are relatively easy to track. A 2017 civil rights complaint looked at social media at Pentucket Regional High School, located about an hour from Boston. That review covered approximately 5,000 tweets from the athletics department\u2019s Twitter account (then @SachemAthletics) from the start of the 2014-15 school year through February 2017.\nThe imbalance of tweets was just one factor that spurred an investigation of the Pentucket Regional School District for Title IX violations by the Office for Civil Rights. In 2017, the school agreed to address the problems.\nWhile some Title IX violations can put girls at risk of physical harm \u2013\u2013 poorly maintained fields, for example \u2013\u2013 unequal opportunities for publicity can send a message about what the school deems important, according to some former athletes.\nCara Hawkins-Jedlicka, an assistant professor at Washington State University, remembered running high school track in Tennessee feeling like girls teams had to reach an extreme to be recognized by her school, while the football team was celebrated even when it had a less-than-perfect season.\n\u201cI thought we had to do better to get coverage,\u201d Hawkins-Jedlicka said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a very harmful statement to give a teenager that \u2018you don\u2019t matter as much and if you do matter, it\u2019s only if you\u2019re winning.\u2019 \u2026 If you\u2019re not feeling important, and you\u2019re not feeling covered, if you\u2019re not feeling like this is useful, that\u2019s something that would probably push you to quit.\u201d\nAs of March 2022, the @SachemAthletics Twitter account no longer exists. Pentucket Regional High School\u2019s athletics director did not respond to requests for comment.\nSome violations of publicity are more subjective, like the use of mascots and nicknames for boys and girls teams.\nA civil rights complaint against Stephenville Independent School District in Texas included a statement about use of different mascots and nicknames for boys and girls teams.\nStephenville\u2019s boys teams are called the Yellow Jackets and the girls teams are referred to as the Honeybees. A 2015 resolution letter found that the different nicknames did not violate Title IX in regard to publicity. However, some Title IX advocates point out that using different nicknames for girls and boys teams can be problematic.\n\u201cNaming is really important and it sends a lot of important messages, so I would say that it is a violation of Title IX,\u201d said Kristen, who is also project director and senior staff attorney for Fair Play for Girls in Sports. \u201cI strongly feel that schools should not create these diminutive nicknames because it is definitely, to me, an indicator of female athletes being treated as lesser.\u201d\nWhile other Title IX violations often seem more egregious compared to equal publicity or use of the school band, providing equal opportunity for publicity is often inexpensive, Kristen said.\n\u201cThis is not like you have to build a new softball field. \u2026 This does not involve construction,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of this is free media, you know, putting out your own social media, on Twitter, on Instagram.\u201d\nStill, lack of publicity remains a reality for high school girls across the country, many of whom are unaware of their rights under Title IX.\n\u201cThis is a place where it\u2019s really easy for members of the school community, parents, coaches, grandparents, even just interested community members, to try and pay attention to what\u2019s happening at your local school,\u201d Kristen said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to just expect high school girls to take on all of that burden.\u201d\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "Pennsylvania passed a law in 2012 requiring public schools to report detailed data on sports programs to ensure gender equity, making it one of five states taking such action, while Congress has repeatedly failed to consider similar measures. Despite the passage of Title IX nearly 50 years ago, the federal government lacks an accurate method to assess compliance with the statute in K-12 schools.",
    "content": "When Pennsylvania state Sen. Mary Jo White met with frustrated players on a girls high school lacrosse team about a dozen years ago, she was dismayed by reports of the inferior treatment they were receiving. She wasn\u2019t surprised.\u00a0\nWhite, who played basketball at her all-girls high school, had already noticed girls across the state received less than boys as she watched her daughter play high school sports.\n\u201cYou could see they didn\u2019t get the training time,\u201d said White, who is now retired. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get the field time. They got it when the boys weren\u2019t using it. They were lucky if they had uniforms, or they just tried to cobble something together. It was not a friendly environment.\u201d\u00a0\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nMeanwhile, on the House side of the Pennsylvania legislature, Rep. Tim Briggs read a news article about parents concerned that their daughters were not being treated fairly in school sports.\u00a0\nAs the father of three girls, Briggs could identify with those concerns.\u00a0\u00a0\nSoon, Briggs, a House Democrat, and White, a Republican senator, championed a measure, passed in 2012, that requires public schools to report troves of data on their school programs \u2014 about who has the opportunity to play and what resources those athletes receive. The goal is to spot unequal treatment of female athletes.\n\u201cWe introduced it thinking it was a pretty common-sense thing,\u201d Briggs said.\nThat makes Pennsylvania one of at least five states that does what the federal government does not: collect in-depth data to measure Title IX compliance and gender equity in K-12 schools. Congress repeatedly has rejected or failed to consider such bills. The most recent failed attempt occurred in 2021.\nNearly 50 years after the passage of Title IX, the federal government still does not have an accurate way of knowing how many high schools and other secondary schools are in compliance with the statute, which requires equal opportunity despite gender, race or disability in education.\u00a0\nThe Office for Civil Rights collects participation data, but those figures can be incomplete and differ substantially from statistics kept by school districts, according to an analysis by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.\n Shep Melnick, professor of American politics at Boston College, said the gender-equity disparities in athletics are much more severe at the high school level than in collegiate sports.\n\u201cI think that the extent to which the Office for Civil Rights would focus more on high schools and less on colleges would be an extremely good idea because the disparities in high school are huge and just really serious,\u201d said Melnick, who has been analyzing Title IX compliance and the law\u2019s evolution.\nWhile college athletics departments have to report a detailed breakdown of participation by gender, the money they spend on scholarships, and other benefits for male and female athletes, K-12 schools don\u2019t face the same scrutiny.\nThe landmark legislation spurred increased participation by girls in high school sports, but Congress has resisted creating the same data reporting requirements that apply to college teams.\u00a0\nBriggs said trying to pass the bill wasn\u2019t easy in Pennsylvania because his counterparts and school districts complained about the burden of collecting and reporting the data. His Republican colleagues also attempted to cut back aspects of the legislation.\nMeanwhile in Washington, former Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and the late Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, were trying to pass a bill similar to the one in Pennsylvania, first introducing it in Congress in 2003.\nSince then, more than 100 members of Congress have co-sponsored legislation that would bring more transparency to high school sports. Every attempt failed in both chambers.\u00a0\nThe bills would have required K-12 schools to report data that shows how much funding their sports teams receive, how many games each team plays, the staff dedicated to each team and more.\nAdvocates for girls in sports, gender-equity researchers, lawyers and lawmakers are adamant that secondary schools \u2014 high schools in particular \u2014 are not complying with Title IX, and teenage girls are paying the price.\u00a0\n\u201cTitle IX is turning 50 in June, and we still estimate that the majority of schools are likely out of compliance with the law,\u201d said Sarah Axelson, vice president of advocacy at the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation. \u201cTransparency certainly wouldn\u2019t fix everything, but it certainly would have the potential to bring us closer and have more informed folks on the ground.\u201d\nSlaughter\u2019s and Snowe\u2019s bills, which would have required K-12 schools to report funding, dedicated personnel for their teams and other data, have been resurrected in both the House and Senate by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Doris Matsui, D-California. In 2018, they introduced the Patsy T. Mink and Louise M. Slaughter Gender Equity in Education Act. Since then, they\u2019ve reintroduced the bill twice \u2014 in 2019 and most recently in June 2021.\u00a0\nThe bills would require the Department of Education to establish an Office for Gender Equity and, like Slaughter\u2019s and Snowe\u2019s bills, would bring more transparency to high school athletics data. If passed, the office would assist schools in following Title IX requirements by creating a handbook and developing training programs.\nHirono declined requests for comment. Matsui did not respond to interview requests.\u00a0\nSlaughter introduced six versions of the bill. Snowe introduced complementary bills in the Senate in 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2011, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, introduced her own version in 2013. They all failed to get a hearing.\u00a0\nAdvocates for more stringent reporting said high school administrators are sometimes reluctant to support increased data reporting because of the burden it might place on athletics directors and principals.\u00a0\nBut school officials are collecting this information anyway, said Peg Pennepacker, a former high school athletics director who now is a consultant on Title IX issues.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of an athletic director\u2019s job. You should be monitoring yourself every single year. It\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\n\u2014Peg Pennepacker, Title IX consultant and former high school athletics director\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of an athletic director\u2019s job,\u201d Pennepacker said. \u201cYou should be monitoring yourself every single year. It\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\nTerri Lakowski, CEO of Active Policy Solutions and a former student-athlete, and other advocates said laws like the ones proposed by Snowe and Murray are essential for students, parents and Title IX lawyers.\n\u201cLaws like this can become so useful because they provide a tool and evidence as to what the school is really doing to comply with Title IX. They can help keep these schools honest when they\u2019re otherwise not being and not complying with Title IX\u2019s requirements,\u201d Lakowski said.\nThe difficulties preventing the bills from gaining momentum are indicative of the attitude toward gender equity in athletics, said Gloria Blackwell, CEO of the American Association of University Women. Blackwell likened the struggles to those faced by the Gender Equity in Education Act, which was first introduced in the 1990s and still hasn\u2019t passed despite multiple efforts by members of Congress.\n\u201cThe mere fact that we\u2019re still talking about something that was introduced initially 20 years ago is also pretty representative of the challenges that are still taking place around gender equity and in education,\u201d Blackwell said.\u00a0\nCongress isn\u2019t alone in its inaction, according to three-time Olympic gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar. She said Title IX advocates have shifted attention to fight other types of sex discrimination and sexual assault that fall under the statute.\n\u201cI think that there really has not been the political will, even by women\u2019s organizations, to make it happen. It just has not been high up enough on the list,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat women\u2019s groups have been doing is nowhere near enough to get it done.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nLakowski compared the lack of compliance in high school sports to speeding. Most people do it and only the extreme cases tend to get pulled over by the cops.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Office of Civil Rights is like the police who\u2019s going to pull you over if you\u2019re flagrantly violating Title IX or speeding 20 or 30 miles an hour over,\u201d Lakowski said. \u201cOtherwise, everything else is really incumbent upon the victim \u2014 the student, the athlete, the parent, or an advocate to speak up and stop them from speeding.\u201d \u00a0\nThe office collects participation data that details how many girls and boys are playing which sports and how many teams are offered to each gender by sport. While the data is collected from across the nation, advocates for girls in sports said the data doesn\u2019t provide an accurate picture of what Title IX compliance in that school or district looks like.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re asking high school students and their families, or 18- to 22-year-olds, college students, to be the ones to make sure that for generations to come that girls and women have equal opportunities,\u201d Hogshead-Makar said.\nTitle IX provides a clear roadmap as to what is required of high school athletics, said Ellen Zavian, attorney and law professor at The George Washington University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have a law to implement,\u201d said Zavian, who was a high school athlete.\u201cIt\u2019s that no one knows how to implement it \u2014 except a few experts.\u201d\nAdvocates such as Blackwell and Hogshead-Makar said enforcement of the statute through new legislation ought to be top of mind for lawmakers.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about protecting all students from sex discrimination, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that there\u2019s compliance with Title IX, because without compliance, without resources, it\u2019s just a law on the books that doesn\u2019t have any teeth,\u201d Blackwell said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long, arduous road,\u201d said Karissa Niehoff, executive director of the National Federation of State High School Associations and an advocate for federal action.\u00a0\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t use that excuse anymore,\u201d Niehoff added. \u201cWhy not? We\u2019re the United States, we\u2019re good at hard roads. And this is about our people. It\u2019s about our kids. It\u2019s about our society.\u201d \n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "content": "Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity, including athletics, that receives federal financial assistance. However, the statute lacks a provision for formal education about Title IX for administrators, students and parents, though it does require districts to have Title IX coordinators to monitor compliance.\nThat means each school district crafts its own Title IX training \u2014 if the district offers any.\n\u201cIt was more of me learning [about Title IX] on the go and learning bits and pieces here and there, but I was never really taught about it until the issue came upon us,\u201d said Madyson Roach, a former softball player at Grant High School in Portland, Oregon.\n\n\u201cIf I was more educated, I could have used my voice more and advocated for change earlier than I started.\u201d\n\u2014Madyson Roach, former softball player at Grant High School, Portland, Oregon\n\n\u201cIf I was more educated, I could have used my voice more and advocated for change earlier than I started.\u201d\nFederal law does not mandate training in schools for Title IX and athletics. The only required training is on sexual harassment, according to Peg Pennepacker, founder of High School Title IX Consulting Services. That provision took effect in August 2020, about 48 years after Congress passed Title IX.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nPatrick Nixon, the athletics director at Mergenthaler Vocational Technical High School in Baltimore, Maryland, is an example of a school staff member who does not have a solid understanding of a Title IX coordinator\u2019s role. Nixon said the district\u2019s Title IX coordinator has not stopped by Mergenthaler to evaluate the athletics department and provide feedback.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s supposed to be happening, but that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Nixon said.\nSome schools share their districts\u2019 training materials with community members. McHenry Community High School in McHenry, Illinois, has links to the training materials on its website, though the primary focus is on Title IX and sexual harassment.\nOn the 126-slide PowerPoint presentation used to train Title IX coordinators, the word \u201cathletics\u201d appears once, as one of nine areas that fall under Title IX.\nGrant High School in Portland, Oregon, where Roach went to school, provides a direct link to the Portland Public Schools website, which includes Title IX resources for students and parents.\nSome school administrations across the country are taking steps to educate themselves, their teachers and their coaches, along with students and parents, to ensure they can provide equal educational opportunities. However, school administrators must do their own research to find resources to provide a more thorough education.\nWhen the National Women\u2019s Law Center\u2019s Jayma Meyer, counsel at Simpson Thacher who does pro bono Title IX work, and her team approached Union City High School in New Jersey about its Title IX violations, the school was willing to make changes.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t realize what they needed to do, or even why. But now that we\u2019ve educated them, they really are committed to doing the right thing.\u201d\n\u2014Jayma Meyer, Title IX lawyer\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t realize what they needed to do, or even why,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cBut now that we\u2019ve educated them, they really are committed to doing the right thing.\u201d\nCharles Webster, director of grants and innovative programming at Union City High, underwent training to become a Title IX coordinator a few years ago, the first time he experienced such training.\nSince then, Webster has researched ways Union City High can update its Title IX education. The school is joining the Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA), which allows institutions to pick a Title IX curriculum it would like to focus on and provides workshops on specific topics.\n\u201cI came out and made the recommendation that we join ATIXA because it is, it is progress,\u201d Webster said. \u201cIt is an association that is relevant, that wants to remain relevant. And again, relevancy becomes the key.\u201d\nSome schools and districts have gone beyond basic Title IX education in other ways, especially with this year marking the 50th anniversary of the statute.\nIn Maryland, Amanda Twele, athletics director at John F. Kennedy High School in Silver Spring, established the Women in Sports Committee under Montgomery County\u2019s Athletics Unit in the summer of 2020.\nThe committee\u2019s first event in October 2020 highlighted Montgomery County public school graduates, and its second event in December 2020 had women share their involvement in athletics beyond playing a sport.\nThe committee held an event in February to celebrate the anniversary of the statute.\nUnion City also had aspirations to celebrate the milestone with a grand event at the high school. Union City decided not to wait until June and went ahead with its celebration conference in November 2021.\nIt held a five-hour event with speakers ranging from Meyer to Olympic athletes and coaches such as Sharrieffa Barksdale, Rose Monday, Marlene Harmon Wilcox and LaVonna Martin-Floreal, as well as a pediatrician and a guidance counselor with college recruiting expertise.\n\u201cI really enjoyed it,\u201d said Francisca Polanco, a senior member of both the softball and basketball teams at Union City High. \u201cI feel like I learned a lot with the presenters that came and spoke to us.\u201d\nEllen Zavian, a Title IX advocate, was the first female agent registered by the NFL Players Association.\nZavian wanted to play soccer when she went to high school in the late 1970s, a few years after the statute went into effect. But she was told she couldn\u2019t because there was only a boys team. So instead Zavian ran track, played volleyball and was a cheerleader, as those were options for girls.\n\u201cIf I had known about Title IX, I definitely would have filed a suit against my school when I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to play soccer,\u201d Zavian said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\nZavian said kids in school today know what Title IX is, which wasn\u2019t true when she was a student. Still, she said, students today are not taught how to use the law to their benefit.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still not empowered on how to utilize the law and execute it within their institution,\u201d Zavian said.\nThat\u2019s why some high school teachers, such as Timothy Leary from Rancho Buena Vista High School in California, are doing what they can to educate students so they can advocate for themselves.\nLeary teaches a social studies class, and during a lesson about Title IX a light bulb went off for two of his students. After learning about the statute, they approached the school board to advocate for an on-campus softball field and facilities that matched those of the baseball team. The students came out with a win, although not without some obstacles, and a new softball field opened in February 2021.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely just the importance and the relevancy to my students that just makes it such a great educational tool,\u201d Leary said. \u201cThey can relate to it. They need to learn it.\u201d\nJaelyn Watson, Tatyana Monnay, Colleen Neely, Iman Hassen and Ashkan Motamedi contributed to this reporting\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "Despite nearly 50 years since its enactment, Title IX has not fully achieved its goal of providing equal treatment in high school sports for girls, who often receive inferior resources and opportunities compared to boys. A recent investigation suggests that a significant number of schools remain non-compliant with the law, highlighting ongoing challenges in enforcing gender equity.",
    "content": "Title IX was designed in part to balance the scales for girls and boys in school-based athletics. Some day, maybe it will.\u00a0\nBut nearly 50 years after Congress passed the sweeping law that guarantees equity in\u00a0 \u201cany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d including high school athletics, girls are stuck in an imperfect system that continues to favor boys in many ways.\u00a0\nGirls\u2019 participation in school sports has increased dramatically since 1972. But Title IX advocates say that boys still get better treatment. Often, they say, boys teams are provided nicer uniforms, play on better fields, are led by more experienced coaches, have their practices scheduled at more desirable times (relegating girls teams to early mornings and late nights), play with newer equipment and dress in better-equipped locker rooms. All are potential violations of Title IX.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe still estimate that the majority of schools are likely out of compliance with the law,\u201d said Sarah Axelson, vice president of advocacy at the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation.\nWhen girls see that they\u2019re getting worse treatment, their options include challenging their coach or principal, filing a lawsuit and lodging a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education \u2014 all daunting for a teenager. When parents step forward to report these situations, they\u2019re often at the center of disputes that can roil their child\u2019s high school. Not surprisingly, only a small percentage of likely violations end up being reported.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe still estimate that the majority of schools are likely out of compliance with the law.\u201d\n\u2014Sarah Axelson, vice president of advocacy, Women\u2019s Sports Foundation\n\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nA four-month investigation by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland raises serious questions about the effectiveness of Title IX in the 23,882 public high schools across the U.S. It raises concerns about how many of the 3.4 million girls playing high school sports have experienced violations of Title IX that went unaddressed.\nAmong the findings:\n\u2022 Title IX isn\u2019t aggressively policed by state or federal government officials. It\u2019s mostly up to teenagers and their parents to report violations.\n\u2022 Most parents and students aren\u2019t well informed about the law. The federal government doesn\u2019t require schools to offer education about Title IX and athletics.\n\u2022 Reporting Title IX violations often means standing up to school officials like coaches and principals. That\u2019s a lot to ask of high school students and their parents.\n\u2022 Title IX enforcement protocols are cumbersome and slow-moving. A review of 39 complaints to the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights by the Povich and Howard centers showed that the average time from filing to resolution was nearly two years. That means girls who suffered unequal treatment often graduated before they saw results.\u00a0\nViolations reach girls across the country:\nIn Union City, New Jersey, a highly publicized athletics field that sits on the roof of a $180 million high school building was mostly used by boys teams. For nearly 10 years, access for girls was limited. \n\n\u201cMost of these athletes just presume that there must be a reason that they\u2019re getting second-class treatment. It\u2019s everywhere they look. They see that men are getting more than women everywhere. In high school, in junior high school, in college, men are getting more.\u201d\n\u2014Nancy Hogshead-Makar, three-time Olympic gold medalist and Title IX lawyer\n\nIn Ewa Beach, Hawaii, girls on the water polo team argued that they had to practice on dry land or in the open ocean before their season because they couldn\u2019t get funding for a pool.\nIn Ventura, California, girls on the softball team suffered injuries on a field that was poorly maintained, while the boys baseball team had a field that was better tended at a higher quality stadium.\n\u201cMost of these athletes just presume that there must be a reason that they\u2019re getting second-class treatment,\u201d three-time Olympic gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar said. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere they look. They see that men are getting more than women everywhere. In high school, in junior high school, in college, men are getting more.\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Title IX has had a positive impact on girls and opportunities for them to play sports. Consider Title IX\u2019s impact on participation in high school sports. During the 1971-72 school year, girls made up about 7% of high school athletes in the country. For every girl playing on a high school team, there were more than 12 boys.\u00a0\nThrough the years, the participation gap steadily has narrowed. In a National Federation of State High School Associations survey of athletics participation in the 2018-19 school year, girls accounted for almost 43% of all high school players.\nBut the promise of Title IX has yet to be achieved.\u00a0\nEducation is lacking\nThe greatest challenge may be education. Teenagers and their parents first have to understand the law before they challenge school authorities.\nInterviews with dozens of parents and their children across the country by the Povich Center and Howard Center revealed a range of understanding of Title IX. Many high school athletes and their parents don\u2019t know that the law exists. Others said they\u2019d heard of the law but didn\u2019t know that protections applied to them.\nIn the late 1970s, Ellen Zavian \u2014 the first female agent licensed by the National Football League Players Association and a Title IX advocate \u2014 wanted to play soccer in high school. But she was told she wouldn\u2019t be able to because there was only a boys team.\u00a0\nSo Zavian ran track, played volleyball and cheered.\n\u201cIf I had known about Title IX, I definitely would have filed a suit against my school when I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to play soccer,\u201d Zavian said. \u201cBut, I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\nThat information gap still exists. Grace Saad, a former softball player at Buena High School in Ventura, California, didn\u2019t realize she could do anything when her teammates threw around the term \u201cTitle IX\u201d after noticing a clear disparity in how they were treated compared to their counterparts on the baseball team.\n\n\u201cI knew that things weren\u2019t equal, but I just thought that\u2019s the way it was.\u201d\n\u2014Grace Saad, former softball player, Buena High School, Ventura, California\n\nWhile the Buena High baseball team has a stadium, dugouts and a permanent outfield fence with a scoreboard, the softball team often didn\u2019t have enough softballs to hold batting and fielding practice at the same time.\n\u201cI knew that things weren\u2019t equal, but I just thought that\u2019s the way it was,\u201d said Saad, who graduated in 2020.\u00a0\nCourses and webinars in public schools could help inform students, coaches and administrators. But a federal education mandate like the one for parts of Title IX that refer to sexual assault doesn\u2019t apply to sports.\u00a0\u00a0\nDifficult choices for student, parents\nAt the beginning, someone notices a problem. It might fit into one of the two baskets of Title IX compliance \u2014\u00a0 \u201cparticipation\u201d or \u201ctreatment and benefits.\u201d\nParticipation applies to opportunities for girls to play sports as compared to the percentage of girls in a given high school, the proportionality test. If 60% of students in a high school are girls, approximately 60% of athletic opportunities should be for girls, according to Title IX.\u00a0\nTreatment and benefits refers to where girls play and what they play with, among other things. Title IX doesn\u2019t mandate that boys and girls teams have exactly the same of everything. It does require that they receive equal treatment in locker rooms, practice and game venues, scheduling of games and practices, publicity and coaching experience.\nAt Pentucket Regional High School in West Newbury, Massachusetts, the issue was Twitter. When the school tweeted live updates from its athletics account, 60% focused on boys teams compared to only 32% for girls teams. The Office of Civil Rights determined that the school would be required to monitor publicity efforts to ensure that any inequalities are corrected.\u00a0\nA person with a concern about any of these issues can report them to their high school. A meeting with a principal or athletics director might quickly settle the issue.\nWhen diplomacy fails, there are options in the courts and with the Office for Civil Rights.\u00a0\nUnder Title IX, the the office investigates complaints about sexual violence, treatment of pregnant students and treatment of LGBTQ students, as well as school-based sex discrimination in sports. When a person files a complaint, investigators contact the school, check out allegations and decide if violations have occurred. If they have, the civil rights office issues a resolution letter with steps the school must take to come into compliance.\nA Title IX lawsuit can be costly and time-consuming. Plaintiffs, even when they prevail, often emerge feeling bruised and exhausted.\u00a0\nIn Stillwater, Oklahoma, a group of softball parents filed a Title IX lawsuit against the local school district in August 2020. Ten months later, the parties reached a settlement\u00a0 that addressed many of the parents\u2019 concerns.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite an emotional toll. I think we\u2019ve all lost sleep over it,\u201d said Angela Morgan, a plaintiff in the case and president of the softball team booster club at Stillwater High School.\nEliminating Sex Discrimination\nTitle IX is rooted in the turbulent years of the 1950s and 1960s and the passions that fueled the civil rights movement. In those years, Congress debated laws designed to end racial discrimination in public accommodations, outlawing discrimination in hotels and at lunch counters. Later, its powers were expanded to end discrimination in hiring when companies received government contracts.\nTitle IX\u2019s purpose was to eliminate sex discrimination in education. \u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d Title IX states.\nAt the time, few lawmakers thought about the effect it might have on sports. The subject of sports came up only once during the Senate\u2019s months-long debate of the legislation\u00a0 \u2014 and that was no more than a passing exchange. Sen. Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana and the bill\u2019s sponsor, told one of his Senate colleagues: \u201cI do not read [Title IX] as requiring integration \u2026 of the football fields,\u201d as recounted by author Welch Suggs in \u201cA Place on the Team: The Triumph and Tragedy of Title IX.\u201d\nDespite the profound impact the statute has had on girls and women in sports, those original 37 words included no references to athletics.\u00a0\nNearly 50 years later, Title IX and opportunity for girls in sports are nearly synonymous. The gains made by high school girls over the decades have been significant, but boys often still get better treatment.\nWhen the state-of-the-art, rooftop athletics field was unveiled in 2009 in Union City, New Jersey, it quickly gained national attention for its innovative design. The boys football team played on it for nearly a decade; use by girls teams was restricted.\u00a0\nThe National Women\u2019s Law Center pointed out the problem to Union City High School, and the administration made changes.\nToday, girls teams share the field with boys, using it extensively for their practices and games. In fact, Union City High School is in many ways a model for gender equity in sports.\nIt\u2019s a reminder that Title IX can be monitored and aggressively enforced. But for 50 years it hasn\u2019t been.\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, public school enrollment in Maryland decreased by 2.96% in the fall of 2020, with a further 0.12% decline in the following year, while homeschooling rates saw an unprecedented 53.6% increase.",
    "content": "As a grassroots, volunteer-based organization that connects homeschoolers across the state, the Maryland Homeschool Association (MDHSA) has been tracking data collected by the state education department on homeschooling rates for nearly 20 years. It always tended to fluctuate seemingly randomly, said founder Alessa Keener, never changing by more than 9%.\n\u201cSome years, it goes down. Some years, it goes up,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s never really been, I think, a good explanation [as to] why.\u201d\nBut in the spring of 2020, the face of education changed drastically throughout the United States as the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the country. The MDHSA anticipated increasing numbers of homeschooling parents, but the 53.6% increase that came was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Keener said.\nThe change MDHSA noticed was a result of a national trend: parents were pulling their children from public schools as the pandemic persisted. After a slight increase in enrollment in the fall of 2019, the nation experienced an approximate 2.64% decrease in public enrollment in the fall of 2020, according to data from each state\u2019s education department.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd Maryland was no exception: the state saw an overall 2.96% decrease in Pre-K through 12 enrollment, according to state education department data. While all counties individually saw a decrease, how much of a drop varied by county.\nAlthough statewide enrollment declined even further between fall 2020 and fall 2021, the decrease was by 0.12%, a much smaller decline than from the first year of the pandemic.\n\n\u00a0\nWhile the majority of counties saw enrollment increase after the first year of the pandemic, seven counties and Baltimore City experienced a further decline in enrollment in the 2021-22 school year.\nMaryland is one of 10 states that, overall, experienced a further decline in enrollment the 2021-22 school year, based on data from the 30 states that have that year\u2019s data available.\n\n\u00a0\nAs schools across the state \u2014 and country \u2014 switched to virtual learning during the spring 2020 semester, many parents grew dissatisfied with their children\u2019s education quality, according to Keener. She said the state saw a wave of what the association calls \u201cpandemic homeschoolers.\u201d\n\u201cThe schools really tried to do their best,\u201d she said. \u201c[Parents] just felt like what the schools were attempting to do was just more frustrating than it was beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nMaryland reached over 42,600 homeschooled students in the 2020-21 school year after never topping 28,000 since at least 2003, according to data from the state education department. This followed a nationwide trend based on the Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey, whose data showed nearly all states experienced an increase in homeschooling rates at the beginning of the 2020-21 school year.\nThe \u201cpandemic homeschoolers\u201d came in two major waves, Keener said, differing in their reasons for pulling their children out of schools.\nThe first wave pulled their children to officially homeschool either that spring or for the upcoming school year, often with the mindset that it would be temporary \u2014 just to \u201cget through\u201d the year, Keener said. Some of these families were concerned about the negative impacts constant computer screen time would have on their children, and others \u2014 including parents of children with ADHD or a learning disability \u2014 found their children could not stay engaged with their virtual classes.\nOther families, Keener said, had already been considering homeschooling their children, and the pandemic gave them the push they needed.\nCOVID-19-related anxiety also played a role, she said, and still currently keeps some parents from sending their children back to schools \u2014 sometimes because the child or a family member is high-risk.\nThe second wave of homeschoolers, she said, came later on into the pandemic as schools started returning to in-person instruction. These parents were more driven by \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons, she said, concerned about mask mandates and possible vaccine mandates for students.\nMany parents also turned to private schools during the pandemic, and, as a result, private school enrollment increased.\n\u201cOur independent schools were able to pivot quickly to remote learning, and then to hybrid learning, and then back to in-person learning with [COVID-19] mitigation strategies in place,\u201d according to Peter Baily, executive director of the Association of Independent Maryland & DC Schools, which currently represents 121 independent schools.\nIn addition, these schools \u201cquickly allocated financial resources\u201d to fund additional programs during the pandemic, according to Baily.\n\n\u00a0\nReports from the Maryland State Department of Education on nonpublic enrollment stated that the pandemic led to temporary closures for some private schools. While the number of traditional private schools tallied in the report increased during the pandemic, the number of church-exempt private schools decreased.\nSome counties, such as Queen Anne\u2019s and Frederick counties, anticipate that public school enrollment will increase in the upcoming 2022-23 school year as the schools return to relative normalcy.\n\u201cWe found that many of the families came back to us when we started offering in-person learning once again,\u201d said Frederick County Public Schools Communications Manager Brandon Oland.\nAnd Keener agrees. She expects homeschooling rates to drop looking forward. However, she does not believe homeschooling will return to pre-pandemic rates.\n\u201cI think traditional brick and mortar families are anxious to get back to their usual educational normalcy with their kids,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] there\u2019s going to be some families who will say, \u2018This was an interesting experiment, and, surprisingly, it\u2019s worked for my family.\u2019 So I think they will continue.\u201d",

These changes come after President Biden criticized the previous policies during his campaign and signed an executive order in 2021 directing a review of existing regulations.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Biden administration is expected to propose new rules this spring aimed at reversing the controversial Trump administration regulations governing the rights of those accused of sexual misconduct in colleges and schools.\nThen-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in 2017 set off a firestorm over new rules under Title IX that gave additional legal protections to accused offenders.\nThe Trump White House contended that colleges and universities \u201chave often stacked the deck against the accused, failing to offer protections such as a presumption of innocence or adequate ability to rebut allegations.\u201d But critics denounced the shift, saying the new policies could lead to courtroom-like hearings where accusers could be cross-examined over their credibility. Some observers said the changes would lead to scores of lawsuits.\u00a0\nPresident Joe Biden was critical of the regulations during his presidential campaign, saying that \u201csurvivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced,\u201d and he promised he would put a \u201cquick end\u201d to it if he was elected.\nBiden signed an executive order on March 8, 2021, instructing the education secretary to review existing regulations \u201cas soon as practicable, and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.\u201d\nThe Department of Education confirmed to Capital News Service that the notice is expected in the spring and \u201cwill provide the public an opportunity to comment and will precede the issuance of a final rule.\u201d\nThe new policies are also expected to create additional protections for LGBTQ+ students, according to Biden\u2019s executive order.\nTitle IX, a federal civil rights law passed in 1972, prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or educational settings that receive funding from the federal government.\nIn 2018, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, was one of many members of Congress to speak out against the regulations implemented by the Trump administration, saying that DeVos was \u201con the side of those accused rather than the victims.\u201d DeLauro said she worried that her proposed rules would \u201cremove policies that hold perpetrators accountable and help ensure schools are maintaining a safe environment for their students.\u201d\nFour years later, DeLauro said she is looking forward to the release of new rules.\n\u201cI am encouraged by the Biden administration\u2019s plans to undo the previous administration\u2019s harmful, unjust Title IX policies,\u201d DeLauro told CNS. \u201cThrough the rulemaking process, revisions to enforcement, and updates to case processing, the Department of Education must restore critical protections for student survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment.\u201d\nMajor educational organizations including the National Education Association (NEA) have spoken out against DeVos\u2019 regulations. In a 2018 statement, NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said that the \u201cTrump-DeVos agenda would return schools to a time when rape, assault, and harassment were swept under the rug.\u201d\nRep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, supported the Trump administration regulations. She argued in a statement a year ago that it took DeVos nearly three years to get the Title IX changes \u201cright.\u201d\u00a0\nFoxx opposed Biden\u2019s executive order.\n\u201cThe right to due process is bigger than partisan politics \u2013 it is a cornerstone of American democracy,\u201d the congresswoman said in a March 2021 statement. \u201cBy overturning these stakeholder-vetted, court-supported rules, key protections for victims and the due process rights of the accused would be jeopardized.\u201d\nIt\u2019s On Us, a national sexual assault prevention organization, along with other similar groups, created the #EdActNow campaign to petition the Department of Education to issue proposed changes as early as October 2021, and until then, to not enforce the Devos rule.\u00a0\nHowever, the 2020 regulations are still in place and will be in effect until new rules are passed by the Department of Education.\nTracey Vitchers, executive director of It\u2019s On Us, said she was upset when the Department of Education was not able to meet the October deadline. She told CNS she believes part of the reason lies with the Senate delaying the confirmation of Catherine Lhamon, narrowly confirmed last October as the Education Department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights.\u00a0\nLhamon served as assistant secretary under the Obama administration and worked on guidance that created protections for transgender students in schools and set out how schools should investigate Title IX claims. These were among the guidelines repealed by the Trump administration.\u00a0\nVitchers said she hopes that the Biden administration puts forward a rule that takes into consideration how traumatic sexual violence can be for survivors and that will emphasize reporting and holding accountable schools that have \u201ca culture of violence on campus.\u201d\n\u201cI also am hopeful that them taking the amount of additional time that they have results in a stronger rule, results in a rule change that is effective, is supportive of student safety and survivor rights,\u201d she said.\nVitchers said she has seen the harm that the existing regulations have caused. She specifically highlighted \u201cequity issues\u201d within the reporting process, including how schools are prevented from taking anything seen as disciplinary action on students who are accused of sexual misconduct until they have gone through the full \u201cinvestigative and adjudicated process.\u201d\n\u201cStudent survivors on campus are like, \u2018Well, why is so-and-so, who we know has been accused of sexual assault, still playing the football game on Saturday?\u2019 It\u2019s because the investigation has not been completed,\u201d Vitchers said. \u201cThe coach\u2019s hands are tied because prohibiting that student from competition because of the allegations of sexual assault could be interpreted as unwarranted disciplinary action that violates the accused student\u2019s rights.\u201d\u00a0\nVichers also highlighted the inequities within the live cross-examination process at Title IX hearings that the 2020 rules laid out.\u00a0\nAdvocacy groups and individuals sued the Department of Education over the 2020 rules, claiming that the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. While the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts upheld most of the rules put in effect under DeVos, the court invalidated one part that prohibited \u201cdecision-makers in Title IX proceedings\u201d from \u201cconsidering any \u2018statement\u2019 from a person who did not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing.\u201d\nThe court called the provision \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and underscored how respondents could schedule live hearings at inconvenient times or talk witnesses out of attending hearings and \u201crest easy knowing that the school could not subpoena other witnesses to appear.\u201d\nAs of August 24, 2021, the Department of Education has not enforced parts of the rules that the court vacated. However, all other provisions put in place by the Trump Administration remain in effect until new rules are announced.\u00a0\nBackers of the Trump rules are not eager to see major changes.\u00a0\nThe 2020 regulations brought \u201cbalance to campus proceedings\u201d by including procedural protections for accused students, according to Joe Cohn, the legislative & policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). FIRE is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that advocates for\u00a0student and faculty individual rights at colleges and universities.\n\u201cThe 2020 regulations were extremely helpful\u2026because prior to the regulations, there were minimal if any rights for accused students that were required by the federal government,\u201d Cohn told CNS. \u201cThe only way to secure particular due process proceedings was to sue after the fact when basic procedural protections were skipped.\u201d\nData on the impact of the regulations isn\u2019t widely available yet due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Cohn.\u00a0\n\u201cFor most of 2020 and 2021 schools were remote,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cSo data on decreased or increased reports is unreliable because there were too many other variables to really draw any conclusions from.\u201d\nCohn said he hopes that the new regulations will constitute modest changes.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to work with this administration if they\u2019re really serious about having a policy that respects the rights of all students,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope they go that route instead of deciding to just play ping pong with Title IX policy.\u201d\nVitchers said she also recognized that Title IX regulations regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment have turned into a political back-and-forth. Since 2011, the regulations have been rewritten multiple times and have generated campaign promises to undo or redo specific provisions, by the administrations of Barack Obama, Trump and now Biden.\u00a0\n\u201cSexual assault does not care if you are a Democrat or Republican\u2026so the fact that Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration turned it into this political issue that it never should have been, was really harmful,\u201d Vitchers said. \u201cMy hope is that with the rule change, we will return to a rule that is fundamentally grounded in upholding students\u2019 civil rights and campus safety at large because that\u2019s what Title IX is about.\u201d",

Over 9% of the overall student population tested positive for the virus since August.\n\nIncluding Crisfield, three out of the nine schools in the county have had over 7% of the student population test positive in the four months since public schools returned to in-person instruction.\u00a0\nThe other two schools, Somerset Intermediate Elementary School and Carter G. Woodson Elementary School, have both had nearly 8% of the school population test positive.\u00a0\nThis trend is maintained when positive staff COVID-19 cases are included with the students. Schools that had high numbers of student cases have also seen high numbers of staff cases.\n\nSomerset County has the lowest vaccination rate of all Eastern Shore counties in Maryland, with 46% of the county\u2019s population fully vaccinated, compared to the 67% overall vaccination rate for Maryland, according to the New York Times COVID Dashboard.\u00a0\nWith the recent approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 and efforts underway to vaccinate children in Maryland, some county school systems, like Montgomery County, Baltimore County and Howard County, have encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated.\u00a0\nHowever, SCPS has taken a different stance.\n\u201cThe Somerset Board of Education is neutral regarding student vaccination. The belief is that it is the parent's choice to make medical decisions for their child, not the school district,\u201d Miele wrote.\u00a0\nAccording to Miele, Somerset County Health Department has set up make-shift vaccine clinics for the 12 to 17 age group in their schools in the past. Miele stated that the school has done the same for the 5 to 11 age group.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have given space in our elementary schools this month for the Somerset Health Dept to conduct vaccine clinics for this age group, however this is a health dept initiative, not a SCPS initiative.\u201d\nThere are four total vaccination clinics in Somerset, according to the Maryland Coronavirus Vaccination Clinic page and Somerset County Health Department. Somerset is among four counties on the Eastern Shore with the highest numbers of residents per clinic. Somerset has a population of 25,616 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 6,404 people for each clinic. The other three counties, Cecil, Caroline and Queen Anne\u2019s, range from around 6,700 to around 7,350 people per clinic.\u00a0\nThe other five counties on the Eastern Shore range from about 3,000 to about 5,750 people per clinic.\u00a0\nSomerset County had the highest poverty rate of any Eastern Shore county in 2019 with 23.6%, according to the 2019 U.S. Census. The rest of the counties\u2019 poverty rates on the Eastern Shore range from 6% to 16%.\n\n \n\u201cWe are also extremely rural (the county population is about 26,000), and such a large percentage of our students live below the poverty line that we receive the majority of our funding from the state and all students receive free school meals. We also know that higher rates of Covid exist among underserved populations for a variety of documented reasons,\u201d Miele said.\nLess affluent populations are more at risk of COVID-19 because of pre-existing illnesses, like heart and respiratory conditions, that are more common among this group, according to the Brookings Institution. Additionally, the ability to practice social distancing and to work from home are less likely.\nThe lack of reliable internet services also affects the ability to quickly pivot to online learning, according to Miele.\n\u201cSomerset County cannot just flip to virtual instruction when rates go up like some other districts can. We also lack reliable internet throughout the county. And many services to these underserved students can\u2019t be delivered remotely. It\u2019s been a very challenging few school years, to say the least,\u201d Miele said.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are wide gaps by income class in both the risk posed by the virus, because of existing health conditions, and in levels of response to the risk of infection.\u201d\nSomerset has the highest population of Black people, about 41.5%, among the Eastern Shore counties, according to the 2019 U.S. Census.\u00a0\n\n \nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, data throughout the pandemic showed that marginalized groups, mainly Black and Hispanic/Latino people, are hospitalized and have died from COVID-19 at higher rates than people who are white and non-Hispanic.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014\u00a0A new superintendent is being hired to help manage Maryland\u2019s schools for troubled youth, starting in January.\nThe Juvenile Services Education Program, which Gov. Larry Hogan, R, signed into law in July, has started the scouting process for a new superintendent, who will be in charge of managing the education of all children in the state\u2019s juvenile treatment facilities.\n\u201cHiring a Superintendent is one of the most important jobs placed upon the (Juvenile Service Education Program) board\u201d Grace Reusing, chair of the board,\u00a0 said in a Sept. 27 press release.\u00a0\nIn the same release, Reusing added, \u201cwe are in the process of a rigorous national search and plan to have the new superintendent in place by January 2022.\u201d\nReusing told Capital News Service that the superintendent will address issues involving teacher pay and retention. Although whoever fills the position will not have the power to raise wages, they will be able to propose these changes to the Legislature.\u00a0\nOne of the biggest challenges the facilities are having, according to Reusing, is keeping teachers employed. She said this is due to the fact that they aren\u2019t getting paid as much as they would in a community school and they are working all year round.\u00a0\nLikewise, students are transferring in and out of the facilities all year. Reusing said the new superintendent will help implement a more career-driven curriculum for students, who currently receive six hours of education a day.\u00a0\nCurrently, the Juvenile Services Education Program\u2019s schools teach about 3,500 15- to 18-year-old students per year. The Maryland Department of Juvenile Services runs 12 detention and residential treatment centers across the state and a school operates on each campus.\u00a0\nThe job description, posted on the state of Maryland\u2019s job openings website, states that \u201cthe Superintendent of JSEP will champion equitable, high quality, holistic and individualized education for a unique student population, identify metrics and communicate high expectations for JSEP, and drive related transformation efforts.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the press release announcing the start of recruitment, the job will be open for applications until the end of October.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education will transition their educational services to the Juvenile Services Education Program starting on July 1, 2022.\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

Health experts anticipate that vaccinating younger children will significantly reduce transmission rates and severe illness among them.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Maryland schools are gearing up for potential Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds.\nMohammed Choudhury, Maryland state superintendent of schools, told Capital News Service in an email that the vaccine is the best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cThe expansion of vaccine administration to younger children will help prevent school outbreaks, reduce the numbers of students and staff in quarantine, and continue to keep students and staff in classrooms for full-time in-person learning,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBaltimore County Public Schools will be thrilled when vaccines are authorized and available for all students,\u201d spokesman Charles Herndon told CNS. \u201cThey are the best way of keeping children and staff in our schools safe and COVID free.\u201d\nPfizer and BioNTech announced Sept. 20 that a smaller dose of their vaccine was safe and had \u201crobust neutralizing antibody responses\u201d among the 5- to 11-year-olds in their trial.\u00a0\nThe FDA said Friday that it set a vaccines advisory committee for Oct. 26 in anticipation of Pfizer\u2019s request for the vaccine\u2019s authorization.\n\u201cWe are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,\u201d Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 children and adolescents was nearly five times higher in mid-August than in late June, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nDr. Milagritos D. Tapia, a pediatrics professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the vaccine \u201cwill decrease transmission in schools, and would \u2026 decrease the opportunity for children to become severely ill or experience the (after effects) of COVID infections, which do occur in children.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Maryland Health Department recognizes vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds \u201cwould be an important peace of mind for parents,\u201d agency spokesman Andrew Owen said in an email to CNS. He added that the department is working with local jurisdictions and school systems to prepare for the vaccine\u2019s approval.\u00a0\nDana Smith, a parent of an 11-year-old student at Arbutus Middle School in Baltimore County, described the start of the school year as \u201cnerve-wracking with the local positivity rate being up and the community spread bouncing between substantial and high,\u201d she told CNS via Facebook Messenger.\nSmith said her heart skips a beat each time the school sends COVID-19 case notifications because she wonders if the students who contracted the virus were in any of her son\u2019s classes.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to the vaccine being approved for kids, and I plan to have my son vaccinated as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\nCOVID-19 last month hit elementary schools in the Baltimore County Public Schools system harder than the high schools and middle schools. Nearly half of the 240 positive cases it reported from Sept. 10 to Sept. 17 were from elementary schools, according to the school system.\u00a0\nTwo weeks later, from Sept. 24 to Oct. 1, the reported positive cases in Baltimore County\u2019s schools weren\u2019t much better. Out of the 214 reported infections, 104 were from elementary schools.\u00a0\nThe Baltimore County Public Schools system is the third largest in Maryland. Herndon said Baltimore County has a high level of COVID-19 community transmission under CDC criteria.\nHe said having the vaccine authorized for younger children would be a big step toward lowering the school system\u2019s infection rates and making everyone safer.\nHoward County Public School System Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano said he\u2019s a very strong proponent of younger students being vaccinated, citing their vulnerability to the virus.\nTo keep students and staff safe, the school system engages in constant communication encouraging vaccinations, he said.\u00a0\n\u201cKeeping this in front of everybody is absolutely critical as we try to maintain the health and well being of our students and staff and keep schools open,\u201d Martirano said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main goal.\u201d\nThe Howard County Health Department is working closely with county school officials to determine how to best provide COVID-19 vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds once authorization is given, Dr. Kelly Russo, the department\u2019s medical director, said in an email.\u00a0\nSchool systems across Maryland are making similar preparations ahead of the FDA\u2019s authorization.\u00a0\nThe Anne Arundel County Public Schools system worked with the local health department during the summer to hold vaccination clinics for students and staff, spokesperson Bob Mosier said in an email.\u00a0\nRecently, they have been having conversations about the logistics of providing vaccination clinics if and when they become available for 5- to 11-year-olds, he said.\nFrederick County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Theresa Alban said in an email that the school system and the local health department also are discussing options for offering vaccination clinics.\nThe Baltimore City Public Schools system told CNS in an email that once the vaccine is fully approved, it will continue its partnership with the local health department to ensure vaccines get to students.\u00a0\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona told U.S. News & World Report that it \u201cwould be a game changer\u201d for elementary-aged students to be eligible for vaccinations.\nThe anticipated authorization of the vaccine for children comes amid a renewed push from some Maryland lawmakers to mandate vaccinations for public schools statewide.\n\u201cA requirement for students to be able to be vaccinated for Covid as they enter our schools is another tool we should be considering as a state,\u201d state Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, said in an interview with CNS.\u00a0\nGov. Larry Hogan, R, rejected calls for implementing statewide mandates in a press conference on Sept. 30.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve done so many (vaccinations) we haven\u2019t found the need for it,\u201d he said.\nCalifornia recently announced plans to institute a vaccine mandate in public schools once the FDA fully approves the vaccine for all school-age children, the first state in the country to do so.\nTapia said she recommends Maryland schools encourage families to vaccinate their 5- to 11-year-olds if the FDA authorizes the vaccine for them.\n\u201cI think that there will be concerns, just because there (are) always concerns,\u201d Tapia said.\n\u201cBut if they\u2019re concerned, what they should be more concerned about is their risk of having an infection, and the outcomes of that infection for the child, rather than the risk of having side effects from the vaccines,\u201d she said, referring to data from people aged 16-25 having worse reactions to COVID-19 than the vaccines.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s a safer bet to be vaccinated than to be infected with COVID,\u201d Tapia said.\n(Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau reporter Alex Argiris contributed to this story.)\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

(Courtesy Sept. 1 press release from the Accountability and Implementation Board Nominating Committee)\nCrucial to the passage of the education reform bill was the creation of a \u201cstrong accountability system\u201d to oversee the implementation of the legislation.\nThe seven-member panel will be tasked with that responsibility, as well as with holding school systems accountable for student outcomes.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, which became law in February after the state Legislature overrode Hogan\u2019s 2020 veto, is a wide-ranging bill.\nIt represents a sweeping overhaul of Maryland\u2019s education system, with measures such as higher teacher salaries, expanded access to pre-K and greater support for English learners.\n\u201cWithout adequate representation on the (panel), it will be difficult to sufficiently meet the needs of the Latino students whom this legislation is intended to support,\u201d Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, D-Montgomery, the chair of the Latino Caucus, wrote to Hogan.\nFraser-Hidalgo also wrote that the Latino population has grown to nearly 12% in Maryland, according to the 2020 census, and that \u201cLatino youth constitutes the largest proportion of English Language Learners.\u201d\nSauls addressed the bipartisan blowback over the committee\u2019s decision not to present any Latino nominees.\n\u201c(It was) as diverse as we could get, given the pool we had, which was limited in terms of Latinx representation,\u201d Sauls said.\nOf the 43 applicants, only one identified as Hispanic and one as Afro-Latino, according to a Sept. 1 press release from the nominating committee.\nHogan also expressed concerns about the nominees\u2019 geographic distribution.\n\u201cWhile many of the nominees selected are undoubtedly qualified individuals, there is a discernible lack of representation from the majority of jurisdictions in the State,\u201d Hogan noted in his letter.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nPrince George\u2019s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, D, also wrote a letter to Hogan, expressing her concern that none of the nominees live in Prince George\u2019s County, the state\u2019s second-most populous jurisdiction.\n\u201cWhile I appreciate that a representative from Prince George\u2019s County Community College will be considered...(the nominee) is not a county resident, nor does she interact with our public schools on a daily basis,\u201d Alsobrooks wrote.\nSen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s, who serves as vice-chair of the nominating committee, responded to that concern.\n\u201cI actually solicited from people in Prince George\u2019s County who are very respected, and they chose not to do it,\u201d Pinsky told Capital News Service.\nAs of mid-day Sept. 17, the committee had not reopened applications.\n\u201cRight now there have been no changes to that slate of nine,\u201d Sauls said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know until I hear further from the attorney general.\u201d\n\u201cSince we provide counsel to the committee, any advice we may provide would be privileged,\u201d Raquel Coombs, a spokesperson for the Maryland attorney general\u2019s office, wrote in an email to Capital News Service.",

    "summary": "Maryland is experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks in 43 schools, with over 200 schools having had outbreaks since October 2020, according to state health data. Baltimore County leads with the highest number of cases and affected schools, including two private schools that reported significant case numbers in February.",
    "content": "State data shows multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools across Maryland.\nThere are currently 43 schools experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, according to the Maryland Department of Health website.\nSince the website started tracking COVID-19 outbreaks in Maryland schools in October 2020, there have been outbreaks in 216 schools.\n\n\n\nSchools listed as experiencing an outbreak on the website have at least two confirmed COVID-19 cases among students, teachers or staff who are epidemiologically linked, at least three classrooms or cohorts with cases from separate households, or at least five percent of the entire school population have confirmed COVID-19 within a 14-day period. Schools are removed from the list once health officials determine that 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending.\nTwo schools stand out for a consistently high number of cases. Bais Yaakov Eva Winer High School, an all-girls private school in Baltimore County, hit a peak of 51 reported cases on Feb. 17, 2021. Talmudical Academy, an all-boys private school in Baltimore County, reached 72 reported cases on Feb. 10, 2021. Cases in both schools have decreased since mid-February. Archived data can be found here.\nOf the localities in Maryland, including 23 counties and Baltimore City, 15 have at least one school currently experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. Baltimore County currently has the highest number of cases and schools on the list with 58 and 13, respectively. Washington County is second in both categories, registering 56 cases and nine schools on the list.\n\n\n\nPublic schools on the list have a total of 152 cases across 30 schools, an average of 5.07 cases per school, while the private schools listed have a total 57 cases across 13 schools, an average of 4.4 cases per school.\n\n\n\nBaltimore and Washington County, currently the counties with the highest number of positive cases in schools, both rank in the top half of infection rates per 1,000 people for all Maryland counties. Baltimore County has an infection rate of 74.8 per 1,000 people while Washington County\u2019s infection rate is 92.3 per 1,000 people.\nWorcester County has the third highest number of positive cases in schools, with all 24 cases reported at Stephen Decatur High School. The county ranks right in the middle with 67.4 cases per 1,000 people.\nWashington County Public Schools (WCPS) have been in the fourth phase of their \u201cReturn to Learn\u201d plan since Feb. 16. In this phase, students are able to attend in-person classes five days a week while distance learning is offered to those who do not wish to return to the classroom yet.\n\u201cOther schools across the state and across our county have seen similar case numbers, but they are not included in the dashboard because two or more cases are not epidemiologically linked,\u201d said Erin Anderson, a Communications Officer for WCPS. \u201cOverwhelmingly, we have found that individuals catch COVID-19 from activities outside of school and we have been able to prevent the spread of the virus in our schools.\u201d\nAnderson noted that the Washington County Health Department has not deemed it necessary to close the schools on the state\u2019s outbreak list.\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) has long been vocal about the reopening of schools, having called on schools, on Jan. 21, to do their best to reopen by March 1 if they hadn\u2019t already.\nIn a letter addressed to Cheryl Bost, President of the Maryland State Education Association, on Jan. 21, Hogan and Karen Salmon, State Superintendent of Schools, called for schools to reopen. An increase in learning loss and failing grades was a driving factor in Hogan\u2019s push to open schools, according to the letter.\n\u201cThe clear social and emotional toll that online learning has taken on students, families, and educators is yet another unquantifiable impact of the prolonged school building closure,\u201d wrote Hogan and Salmon. \u201cTherefore, immediate action must be taken by every school system in our State to provide opportunities for in-person instruction to all students.\u201d\nOn March 19, the CDC released new studies recommending that students should maintain three feet of social distance in classrooms where mask mandates are required.\nSix feet of social distancing is recommended where transmission rates are high and cohorting is not possible. Teachers and other faculty are recommended to remain six feet apart when interacting with both students and other adults.\n\u201cIt will never be \u2014 and never has been \u2014 100 percent risk-free to return to school. We know a lot more than we did last spring about how to prevent transmission, and vaccination is on the rise,\u201d Allison Barlett, Associate Professor of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at University of Chicago Medicine, told the New York Times. \u201cThere are significant deleterious effects on children who are learning remotely, and that needs to get equal attention.\u201d\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in-person learning in schools has not contributed to substantial community outbreaks. Children age 5-17 account for just under 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Maryland has been one of the slowest states in returning students to in-person learning, as only 57.4 percent of its students have gone back to in-person classes. As of April 20, only four states \u2014 California, Hawaii, New Mexico and Oregon \u2014 have a smaller percentage of students back in classrooms, according to Burbio, a website that has been tracking the return of students to classrooms during the pandemic.\nPrince George\u2019s County became the last school district in Maryland to begin reopening their schools on April 6. As of April 22, Prince George\u2019s County has no school cases or schools experiencing outbreaks and has an infection rate of 90 per 1,000 people.",

Before the pandemic, 520,000 Maryland households lacked broadband access, significantly impacting education and work.",
    "content": "The digital divide has become a major talking point since the pandemic forced jobs, schools and doctors\u2019 offices online.\nBut concerns with the growing divide between those with and without broadband access arose before the pandemic forced millions of Americans to shelter in place.\nThe Abell Foundation found in a 2020 report that 520,000 households in Maryland did not have access to broadband internet at home.\nThe Federal Communications Commission defines broadband internet as a service providing a download speed of 25Mbps and an upload speed of 3Mbps.\nAs jobs and schools were forced online, access to a stable internet connection became even more important to day-to-day life, especially in education.\nThe Maryland State Education Association reported in July that 82% of their members said access to reliable internet was a problem for students, while 44% of educators themselves had issues.\n\u201cIf our students don\u2019t have the equipment that they need, then they are living in digital darkness,\u201d said state Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith, D-Prince George\u2019s.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine rollout\u2019s early days were also plagued with difficulty, as myriad websites used to register created frustration.\nTo combat the growing digital divide, lawmakers in Annapolis passed SB66/HB97, also known as the Digital Connectivity Act.\nThe legislation\u2019s aim, according to the bill\u2019s summary is to ensure: \u201cevery resident of the State is supported by high-quality broadband Internet service at an affordable price and has the tools necessary to use and take advantage of the Internet.\u201d\n\u201cClearly there were divides in access to high-speed internet before the pandemic.\u201d Del. Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, who sponsored the house bill, said.\nLierman acknowledged that the digital divide was not a new problem, but an issue made worse by a pandemic that made Marylanders more dependent on high-speed internet access.\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s the ability to work from home, visiting the doctor through a zoom appointment rather than in person\u2026the pandemic has really exposed the preexisting digital divide.\u201d\nThe bill, signed into law on Apr. 13, expanded the current Office of Rural Broadband established by Gov. Larry Hogan, R, by executive order in 2017 into a statewide organization.\nThe Office of Rural Broadband, now known as the Office of Statewide Broadband, will oversee efforts to expand infrastructure and close the digital literacy gap statewide.\nBefore its elevation to a statewide office, the Office of Rural Broadband had already made strides to increase broadband access in the state\u2019s 18 rural counties.\nIn 2020, the office funded 21 projects, including a $5.8 million effort to construct new infrastructure in Charles County.\nThe expansion constructed by ThinkBig Networks LLC, a regional ISP serving Charles, Kent, and Queen Anne\u2019s counties, will bring internet speeds of up to a gigabit per second to some 1,408 homes and 76 businesses.\nKenrick Gordon, the director of the Office of State Broadband, acknowledged that physical infrastructure was only part of the problem.\nA digital literacy program aimed at educating Marylanders on the resources available to them is also in the planning stages.\nThe office has also established a speed test website to gather more accurate information about speed and accessibility to broadband internet across the state (https://maryland.speedsurvey.org/)\n\u201cThose who have never had broadband access need to understand the services and resources that will be available to them and make informed decisions when they can access broadband,\u201d Gordon said.\nSB66/HB97 passed both chambers with great bipartisan support in both the House of Delegates and the Senate.\nThe bill was amended to establish a mandate to expand broadband access to 98% of Marylanders by Dec. 31, 2025, as well as establishing two funds to enhance broadband access.\nThe Digital Inclusion fund establishes grants of up to $500,000 to nonprofits and local governments working to expand training education on broadband tools.\nA Digital Connectivity fund was also established to provide grants for communities working to expand access to disconnected communities.\nThe creation of the Office of Statewide Broadband comes one month after Hogan announced how the $3.9 billion in American Rescue Plan would be used.\n\nSome $300 million was dedicated to broadband infrastructure, with the largest amount doled out to dealing with physical infrastructure, and the rest going to device subsidies and municipal grants.\nThe funds will help the Office of Statewide Broadband deal with both issues of affordability and broadband infrastructure, Gordon said.\nSen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, said that federal money both provided in the American Rescue Plan and proposed in future federal legislation would help establish broadband as a more \u201cubiquitous\u201d service.",

Expert analysis suggests that schools can safely reopen without significantly impacting community virus transmission rates, emphasizing a disconnect between current evidence and policy decisions.",
    "content": "Maryland public school students have had some of the least opportunities in the nation to attend regular in-person instruction despite the state\u2019s moderate COVID-19 spread.\nRoughly half of normal in-person instruction is open in Maryland \u2014 the fifth-lowest in the nation as of April 13, according to Burbio, a community event tracker.\nMaryland ranks toward the middle of states in daily average of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days, at 23, according to the New York Times tracker.\nJohn Bailey, a visiting fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute \u2014 a Washington, D.C.-based think tank \u2014 produced a report in March analyzing the variety of studies around the world regarding COVID-19 spread and schools.\nA common theme in these studies that the report details is that school reopenings, so long as they follow safety protocols, do not impact COVID-19 outbreaks in their surrounding communities.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of learning from the past year that we haven\u2019t adjusted it to the reopening of schools,\u201d Bailey told Capital News Service. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been grounding these decisions in evidence.\u201d\nBailey emphasized the contrast between early concerns about COVID-19 and children to the resulting research over the past year.\nWhile there were early concerns that children would be especially at risk to COVID-19 as they were to diseases like influenza, research has been clear that children, in terms of severity of symptoms, are at little to no risk of the coronavirus.\nAnother concern was that children would spread the virus by going to school regularly, but research has consistently shown that children spread the virus at a lesser rate than adults.\nAs of April 11, 59.4% of students in the country attend schools with a traditional everyday schedule, 28.4% attend schools with a hybrid schedule, and 12.2% attend schools that are virtual only, according to Burbio.\n\nMonday marks the final phase of the reopening plan in Maryland, as six districts, including Baltimore County and Montgomery County, will be welcoming students for more regular in-person instruction. (http://marylandpublicschools.org/newsroom/Documents/School-System-Instructional-Status-Form.pdf)\nWhile there is no public data on the number of teachers vaccinated in Maryland, Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, told CNS her union is getting fewer calls from members asking about vaccination appointments.\nBost said she\u2019s heard some concerns from her members regarding lackadaisical enforcements of safety protocols and the quality of HVAC systems in aging school buildings.\nBost added that there could be more transparency at the state level in terms of detailing the number of COVID-19 cases in schools \u2014 a common theme nationwide.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education released data in March showing that in the second quarter of the school year (November 2020 to January 2021), jurisdictions with a middle school student failure rate of 20% in math and science increased by 800% in comparison to the previous year.\nThe data for high school students shows an 800% increase for math and a 300% increase for science. Increases in failure rates of English and social studies trended in similar directions.\nWhen asked about the trend, Bost said that Maryland is not alone and that the comparison to a year with a pandemic is unfair.\n\u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cHow does your electric bill compare to other years? We\u2019re home a lot more now.\u201d\nBost did not express any concern that Maryland students could be falling further behind than states with more in-person instruction.\nBost instead pointed with optimism to the recently passed, multi-billion dollar annual education plan, Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, which is set to increase teacher pay, direct additional resources to poverty-stricken jurisdictions, and create new career training opportunities in schools.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunities moving forward with the Blueprint plan,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be so much more opportunity here in Maryland now.\u201d\nBailey attributed the hesitancy of school reopenings in areas like Maryland in part to partisan fights and labor union conflicts.\n\u201cA lot of people have played into fear-mongering,\u201d Bailey told CNS. \u201cWe should have been celebrating these insights that we\u2019ve been learning and highlighting these best practices.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Bailey said analyzing the impact of a lack of in-person instruction over the past year will focus on three main aspects.\nThe short-term effects, which he said are mostly being studied now, focus on the academic progress and mental health of students.\nThen, he said, there\u2019s the \u201cmedium-term\u201d \u2014 which regards college and career decisions.\nIn the long term, he said, shortcomings in these areas could lead to lost earnings and economic opportunity.",

Chris West, R-Baltimore County, are part of a growing conversation nationally surrounding the economic, mental and physical well-being of college athletes.\nAlso titled the Jordan McNair Safe and Fair Play Act, the bill aims to protect student athletes from tragedies like McNair\u2019s death, and cases of sexual abuse as seen with the Michigan State University gymnastics team.\n\u201cThese are the stakes, life and death, sexual assault, and racial and economic justice \u2014 it\u2019s time for Maryland to end the exploitation of its college athletes by adopting HB0125,\u201d Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Player\u2019s Association, said at a Jan. 27 House Appropriations Commitee hearing.\nOn June 13, 2018, McNair died two weeks after passing out from heat stroke during an offseason workout with the University of Maryland football team.\u00a0\nFive other states have already passed legislation surrounding name, image and likeness \u2014 including Florida, where the bill goes into effect July 1.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for the Maryland General Assembly to stand up to the NCAA and to support our Maryland student athletes,\u201d Lierman said at the hearing.\nUnder current NCAA rules, student athletes are prohibited from profiting off of their name, image and likeness.\nThe NCAA Division I Council was scheduled to vote on the issue in early January, but the vote was delayed and is expected to resume in late March.\u00a0\n\u201cWe would like to see the NCAA get to a point that falls in line with what we\u2019re doing and other states around the country are doing,\u201d University of Maryland Athletic Director Damon Evans told Capital News Service.\u00a0\nEvery other college student who is not an NCAA athlete has the ability to earn money whatever legal way they want using their name, image or likeness.\nProponents of the bill also pinpointed the disparity between college athletes being prevented from earning income off their name, image and likeness, while athletic directors and coaches are often the highest paid public employees in the state.\nMaryland basketball head coach Mark Turgeon was scheduled to make roughly $3 million in 2020, while football head coach Mike Locksley was scheduled to earn a $2.65 million salary in 2020, according to USA Today.\nUniversity of Maryland President Darryll J. Pines was expected to earn $750,000 this year before a 15% pay cut.\n\u201cThese are unnecessary and anti-competitive restrictions; it has the effect of exacerbating student athlete\u2019s financial challenges,\u201d Ready said at a Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee hearing Feb. 25.\nThe ability to generate revenue off of their name, image and likeness could be particularly beneficial for female athletes as well as those athletes of color and those from underprivileged backgrounds.\nFemale athletes traditionally don\u2019t have as many opportunities to pursue their sport at a professional level, which means that they have fewer opportunities to profit than their male counterparts.\nAthletes of color and those from disadvantaged backgrounds can be disproportionately affected by the inability to profit off of their name, image and likeness compared to other non-minority athletes and those from more privileged backgrounds.\n\u201cName, image and likeness is going to help a lot of athletes across all sports,\u201d Evans told Capital News Service.\nEvans also explained that this could be beneficial for athletes across all sports to create a brand for themselves through social media.\nThe University System of Maryland initially expressed concern with the verbiage of some components of the bill, specifically some of the stipulations involving name, image and likeness, which they explained could present an issue for universities in the state deviating from NCAA policy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe University System of Maryland also wanted to ensure that the guidelines proposed for health and safety weren\u2019t already imposed and would act as an extension to the policies currently in place.\nAs such the bill passed the House Appropriations Committee unanimously with amendments that specify the scope of name, image and likeness and would only add health and safety protocols that aren\u2019t currently utilized by institutions within the University System of Maryland.\nOne of the amendments in the bill prevents athletes from using certain types of advertising including those that utilize the branding or logo of their school without permission from the institution or the athletic department.\nBeyond the economic impact of the bill, it also introduces several measures to protect a student athlete\u2019s mental and physical well-being.\nUnder this legislation, any intercollegiate athletic program at a public institution in the state is responsible for developing guidelines to prevent, assess and treat serious sports-related conditions including brain injury, heat illness, and rhabdomyolysis, according to the bill.\nAll three of those injuries can be caused by excessive workload or stress in a workout.\n\u201cWe recognize that the need to pass legislation in order to help save the lives of student athletes is more critical than ever,\u201d Marty McNair, McNair\u2019s father and the founder of the Jordan McNair Foundation, said at a Jan. 27 hearing.\u00a0\n\u201cAccording to the CDC, heat illnesses have been recognized as the leading cause of death and disability among student athletes,\u201d McNair added.\nThe bill also would establish protocols for players returning from serious injury as well as guidelines for those athletes who suffer from conditions like sickle-cell disease and asthma.\nIn addition, the University System of Maryland Intercollegiate Athletics Workgroup along with Morgan State University and St. Mary\u2019s College would be responsible for submitting a report to the General Assembly on any changes with student athlete policy on or before Oct. 1, 2021, and each year thereafter, according to the bill.\nIn support of the bill, Del. Ben Barnes, D-Anne Arundel and Prince George\u2019s explained that the Legislature shouldn\u2019t wait for the NCAA to make their ruling and instead should put pressure on them to do the right thing by student athletes.\n\u201cA government or bureaucracy telling you what to do with your name, that is fundamentally un-American, that is not who we are, these athletes deserve to control their name, image, and likeness,\u201d Barnes said at the floor session.\nThe House version of the bill passed 122-12 Wednesday and has been referred to the Senate Education, Health and Environment Affairs Committee.\u00a0\nNo voting session for the Senate version of the bill has been scheduled.\n\u201cWe go to their games, we tweet our support, and we support them in our words,\u201d Lierman said.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time we should support them here where we can truly make a difference, through passing this legislation,\u201d Lierman added.",

    "summary": "Maryland legislation proposes to allow high school seniors affected by pandemic disruptions to participate in sports for an additional year after graduation. The bill, HB0817 and SB0759, aims to waive certain eligibility requirements for the 2021 graduates, providing them with a chance to complete their high school athletic careers.",
    "content": "Legislation in Maryland could allow senior athletes at public high schools to play sports the year after they graduate, to make up for the challenges and unusual circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\nBased on the current rules set forth by the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association \u2014 winter, spring and fall sports each have a finite start and end date \u2014 with traditional fall sports scheduled to play their seasons in early winter carrying over into spring.\u00a0\nFor example, traditional fall sports \u2014 such as soccer, field hockey and volleyball \u2014 weren\u2019t eligible to begin practicing in some Maryland counties until Feb. 13, drastically different from their typical starting date in the summer before the school year.\u00a0\nThis poses an issue for athletes who traditionally participate in both a fall and spring sport, as both the practice and competition times for the seasons overlap.\nHB0817 and its cross-file SB0759, with sponsors Del. Haven Shoemaker, and Sen. Justin Ready, both R-Carroll, aims to provide senior high school athletes another opportunity to finish what they started keeping in mind these challenges.\n\u201cWe want student-athletes to have the opportunity to finish their high school athletic careers properly,\u201d Ready said in a press release.\nA graduate athlete is considered anyone who was enrolled in grade 12 at a public high school in the state during the 2020-21 school year, graduated from the public high school in 2021 and was eligible to participate in an interscholastic sport at the high school level during the 2020-21 school year, according to a legislative analysis.\nThis bill stipulates that the Maryland State Department of Education waive several eligibility requirements for these athletes including academic progress requirements, age restrictions and graduate eligibility restrictions.\u00a0\nTherefore, if someone graduates in June 2021 they may come back and play their respective sport during the 2021-2022 school year.\u00a0\nHowever, the athlete can only return to play at the same public high school from which they graduated; they can\u2019t transition to another high school post-graduation.\n\u201cHigh school sports mean so much to all our communities as well as the student-athletes who have worked for years to get to where they are,\u201d Ready said in that same release.\nIn early February, Kentucky state legislators filed a bill similar in principle that could allow the state\u2019s high school students, including athletes, to receive a fifth year of instruction and eligibility.\u00a0\nHowever, that bill is more encompassing because it could also allow any student enrolled in a Kentucky public high school during the 2020-21 school year to request that the 2021-2022 school year be used as a supplemental year to retake or supplement any courses a student has previously taken.\nProponents of the Maryland bill assert that its passing could be beneficial to students who were on the fringe of potentially receiving an athletic scholarship, but had their final high school season taken away.\u00a0\nWhile the new law would most likely only be utilized by those students attending local community college or trade school, the passing of this bill gives athletes further opportunity to advance their athletic career at the collegiate level.\n\u201cThe students that were forced to sacrifice all or most of their final year of high school sports deserve the opportunity to enjoy their final season, as well as compete for scholarships that may have been lost due to their inability to play,\u201d Shoemaker said in a press release.\nHowever, there is some skepticism among some high school coaches surrounding the number of athletes who would take advantage of this policy, particularly for college recruiting purposes.\u00a0\n\u201cMost of the recruiting for soccer, lacrosse and other sports comes outside of high school,\u201d Edward Wharton, head soccer coach at South Carroll High School, told Capital News Service.\nRecruiting for those sports outside of football is done at the club level, independent from the school system, which allowed many of them to be operational during the pandemic.\nSpecifically from a football recruiting perspective, that\u2019s where the legislation could be the most beneficial.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat for the young men to get some more film for college opportunities,\u201d Michael Kraus, head football coach at South Carroll High School told Capital News Service.\nHowever, Kraus explained that this bill could lead to graduate athletes taking playing time away from younger players, which could be counterproductive to the younger players\u2019 athletic development.\u00a0\nAnother concern is that the bill could create a slippery slope, prompting other high school classes to want similar treatment.\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s opening Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d Jack Walsh, head football coach at Arundel High School, told Capital News Service.\nWalsh also explained that the inclusion of graduate athletes on teams with current high school students could interrupt camaraderie as fans would be cheering on players no longer enrolled at the school.\nThe Maryland Association of Boards of Education opposed the bill, citing concerns that it would disrupt interscholastic sports.\nThe association also voiced concerns that if passed, the bill would create a separation in the statewide athletic system between high school athletes enrolled in school and those who aren\u2019t.\n\u201cHouse Bill 817 would disrupt this balance by introducing a significant separation between the status of high school athletes who are no longer enrolled students, the enrolled students in the educational setting, and the sports team on which the students and non-students are participating,\u201d John R. Woolums director of governmental relations for the Maryland Association of Boards of Education said in written testimony obtained by Capital News Service.\nThe Maryland Association of Boards of Education and The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association also explained that under this legislation, local school systems would have to review liability policies with non-enrolled students participating in sports on school grounds.\nNo voting session has been scheduled yet for either the House or Senate bill.",

    "content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s $130 billion school reopening plan focuses on making schools safer for teachers and students, although returning to school remains a contentious and difficult issue.\nReopening the majority of K-8 schools within his first 100 days in office is a key part of the president\u2019s $1.9 trillion \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan\u201d passed by the House on Friday on a party-line vote and now under consideration in the Senate.\n\u201cWe can do this if we give the school districts, the schools themselves, the communities, and the states the clear guidance they need, as well as the resources they need that they can\u2019t afford right now because of the economic dilemma we are in,\u201d Biden said in January.\u00a0\nSupporters of the rescue measure will need every one of the 50 Democratic senators to vote for it. Under a procedural process known as reconciliation, a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris vote would allow the package to pass by a simple majority vote.\nSafety measures such as social-distancing and mask-wearing are put into place for students and teachers at schools that are reopening. (Kaitlyn Cupelli/Capital News Service)\nAlthough congressional Republicans also are supportive of returning kids to school, many do not support Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion relief plan.\u00a0\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement after the House vote that Democrats \u201cjammed through a bill that even liberal economists and editorial boards say is not well targeted to this stage of the fight.\u201d\n\u201cMore than a third of its spending, including more than 90% of the K-12 school funding, would not even go out this fiscal year,\u201d he said.\nThe back-to-school plan calls for more COVID-19 testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems in schools. School districts could also use funds to take additional safety measures such as:\n\nReducing class sizes so students and teachers can maintain social distance;\u00a0\nHiring more janitors and implementing mitigation measures;\u00a0\nEnsuring every school has access to a nurse;\u00a0\nHiring counselors to support students as they transition back to the classroom;\nClosing the digital divide that has amplified inequalities during the pandemic;\nProviding summer schools for students who have lost learning time;\nPreventing cuts to state pre-k programs.\u00a0\n\nThe COVID-19 Educational Equity Challenge Grant will also be funded by the Biden plan, said Christian Unkenholz, spokesman for Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Largo. The grant will support state, local and tribal governments in working with teachers and families to respond to COVID-related educational challenges.\n\u201cThis is a question of justice and equity,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWithout this aid, our schools, students and educators will be left to fend for themselves, potentially further delaying the return to in-classroom instruction and leaving kids behind. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has particularly hurt lower-income students, Black and Latino students, and students with disabilities, according to the U.S. Department of Education. \nThe pandemic also has led to increased absences, poor learning outcomes, more hungry kids, and more social isolation.\nResearch on disrupted instruction shows that the cumulative learning loss for students by the end of the 2020-2021 school year could equate to five to nine months on average, said Lora Rakowski, director of communications for the Maryland Department of Education.\n\u201cMany students rely on our school system for food,\u201d Joe Weedon, a member of the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, told Capital News Service.\u00a0 \u201c(Our schools) assure they have safe places so they can focus on their work.\u201d\u00a0\nThousands of Washington students returned to school on Feb. 2 as part of the city\u2019s public schools\u2019 expansion of in-person classroom learning. Twenty-three million dollars was used to prepare buildings for the return to schools, Weedon said, although he said he still has serious concerns about the readiness of a number of facilities.\nMany District of Columbia schools have not yet released data about the quality of their air systems, so it is unknown if the buildings meet the nation\u2019s air release guidelines, Weedon said. Teachers are also only just beginning to receive vaccinations, meaning very few individuals have immunity from COVID-19 at this point.\nWith hybrid-learning, teachers will be asked to do a lot more work, as they will have to teach partially from home and partially at school \u2013 a change that they are not used to, Weedon said. He added that the District\u2019s current return-to-school is not a return to normal, but a return to the safety of their school buildings.\n\u201cWe\u2019d all love a return to normal, but we are still in a pandemic,\u201d Weedon said.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, also has submitted a $1.5 billion supplemental budget focused on education.\u00a0\n\u201cThis supplemental budget provides further support for the safe reopening of Maryland schools,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI want to commend all the teachers, administrators, parents, and public health officials who are doing everything they can to give Maryland students the chance to get back in the classrooms safely.\u201d\nThe budget includes:\u00a0\n\n$931 million to support local school systems and targeted assistance for the safe reopening of public schools.\n$434 million in additional funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Pandemic EBT\u00a0program. This program is intended to help families in Maryland purchase food while schools remain closed due to COVID-19\n$128 million to support the state\u2019s Child Care Scholarship program, including almost $60 million to help support licensed child care providers recover from the impact of the pandemic.\n$35 million from the Governor\u2019s Emergency Education Relief Fund to support the safe reopening of nonpublic schools.\n$20 million from the same fund to support community colleges, private institutions of higher education, and competitive innovation grants.\n\nBy the end of March, 18 out of 24 Maryland school systems will be providing an opportunity for in-person instruction at least two days a week, in elementary, middle and high school grade levels, Rakowski said.\u00a0\nCarroll, Worcester, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Frederick, Queen Anne\u2019s, St. Mary\u2019s, Somerset, Talbot, Washington and Wicomico Counties are among the local school systems currently providing in-person, hybrid instruction.\nFour local school systems are not opening for all grade levels by the end of March, Rakowski said.\u00a0\nHarford County schools are open for elementary K-5 for two days, but only one day for middle and high school students. Baltimore City will open for elementary, K-5 and grades six and nine by the end of March. Charles County has a five-phase reopening plan and will start phase five on March 22, allowing special populations of students to meet in-person four days a week. Prince George\u2019s County will open some of its schools for the month of April.\u00a0\nAs more schools re-open, the Maryland State Education Association has developed a checklist of expectations for every school building, utilizing CDC, Department of Health, and Department of Education health and safety guidelines.\nCheryl Bost, MSEA president and a Baltimore County elementary school teacher, said she believes accelerating the availability of vaccines to teachers,\u00a0as well as following safety guidelines like adequate ventilation and social distancing, are key to protecting the health of students, educators, and families.\n\u201cWe all want to be in school, safely and sustainably, with our students,\u201d Bost told CNS.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s been our goal all along.\u201d",

Larry Hogan\u2019s push to reopen schools by March 1.\nMaryland had the lowest percentage of in-person instruction operating in the nation at 10 percent as of Sunday, according to Burbio, a community event tracker.\nThat number is expected to change drastically come Monday, when Montgomery County, Anne Arundel County, Howard County, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Harford County, and other smaller counties will bring some students back to school.\nPrince George\u2019s County became the final school district in the state to submit a reopening plan, early last week, detailing the return of students in April.\nThe number of days per week of in-person instruction varies in each district, with the most popular option being twice a week.\nThe schools will start with some grade levels, gradually bringing in more over the following weeks.\nStudents can still choose to attend school virtually only.\nHogan announced an executive order Tuesday requiring masks for anyone over the age of 5 on school grounds.\nEarly studies have shown little to no evidence that schools open for in-person instruction have led to a significant spread of the coronavirus in local communities.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in January that schools should return students to the classroom so long as they follow proper safety guidelines such as wearing masks and social distancing.\nSome Maryland districts have received criticism from teachers, who advocate for more specific and collaborative safety measures, while other districts have already opened with little to no resistance.\nTeachers in some school districts, including Anne Arundel County, Howard County, and Montgomery County organized recent protests as they were instructed to return to work at their respective schools.\nMaryland is one of the 35 states where teacher strikes are illegal, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality.\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, told Capital News Service that these protests and overall criticism toward specific reopening plans are intended to ensure the voices of educators are heard and considered when implementing these plans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wrong narrative that we\u2019re trying to not open schools,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cWe want to open schools as long as they\u2019re safe and healthy.\u201d\nBost told CNS the key to maximizing the effectiveness of reopening plans is a collaboration between local district leaders, employees, and parents so that health guidelines are properly implemented.\nCommon safety measures from local districts include wearing masks, social distancing, and staggering the drop-off and pick-up times of students at multiple entrances and exits.\nBost also noted the importance of ensuring teachers are vaccinated before returning to schools, citing Cecil County as a prime example, where teachers have been vaccinated and started in-person instruction in February.\nWhile Bost criticized other counties for not vaccinating teachers before beginning in-person instruction, she said those educators are rightfully complying with reopening guidelines while voicing their concerns.\nThe CDC has continued to assert in recent weeks that the vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite of reopening in-person instruction.\nTeachers with health concerns regarding COVID-19 exposure should be specifically accommodated regarding the safety of reopening efforts, the CDC reported.\nRoughly half of in-person instruction is open across the country, according to Burbio.",

    "summary": "Maryland Republican Del. Lauren Arikan has introduced HB0939, which would allow parents to reallocate public school funds toward alternative schooling options if their district fails to offer in-person instruction by fall.",
    "content": "After Maryland Democrats successfully pushed through a multi-billion dollar education reform bill last week, one Republican lawmaker has proposed pandemic-related education legislation of her own.\nHB0939, introduced by Del. Lauren Arikan, R-Harford and Baltimore counties, would, under the condition that a school district fails to open in-person instruction by the fall, give parents the option to reallocate the public school funds of their child toward an alternative school.\nArikan told the Capital News Service she has heard many concerning stories in parenting and education groups online about the devastating impact of virtual schooling on students.\n\u201cI was inspired by the daily heartbreaking posts I was seeing,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cChildren who weren\u2019t even able to read yet being expected to navigate computer programs. \u2026 And children with all different types of learning styles crying as they sat at the computer day after day.\u201d\nThe funds would come through a grant program overseen by the Maryland Department of Education that parents could apply to.\nThe state\u2019s Department of Education did not respond for comment on the feasibility of the potential program.\nNo additional state money would be spent, as the funds going toward the alternative school would be reallocated from the per-pupil spending of the public school the student attends.\nPer-pupil funding in Maryland is roughly $16,000, according to the Maryland Association of Counties, and would only cover a portion of most private schooling costs. A total of 22 of the 24 school districts have submitted plans to reopen for in-person instruction of some capacity by March 1, according to Gov. Larry Hogan.\nAlthough, Arikan said, there is still some concern as to whether the state\u2019s teachers union will cooperate with the districts to effectively reopen.\nArikan\u2019s bill draws many similarities to some other pandemic-inspired school choice legislation across the country.\nA Utah lawmaker, in an effort to ensure schools follow reopening plans for February, proposed a bill that would allow a portion of per-pupil funding from a school district to be reallocated to a private school of choice. Lawmakers have not yet voted on this bill.\nIn Illinois, a lawmaker proposed a bill that would provide a voucher to families who took their child out of the public school system due to ongoing virtual learning that is equivalent to the per-pupil spending \u2014 be that for private schooling or homeschooling. That bill is yet to be voted on.\nA Georgia bill reallocates per-pupil spending into a state fund that pays for private schooling and homeschooling for those who want to leave the public schools due to virtual learning. That bill is also yet to be voted on.\nCriticism of these voucher-related school choice programs, often coming from teacher unions, oppose the idea of taking away the per-pupil funds of public schools and giving it to private schools.\nThe Maryland State Education Association declined to comment on the bill to CNS.\nCorey DeAngelis, director of school choice at the Libertarian Reason Foundation and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, told CNS that school choice policies like Arikan\u2019s bill are resonating more with parents amid the pandemic for good reason, but should be established regardless of whether instruction is virtual or in-person.\nDeAngelis emphasized the importance of competition within the school system to ensure the best education options are being pursued.\n\u201cPrivate schools have been fighting to reopen, but so many teachers unions have been fighting to remain closed,\u201d he told CNS. \u201cThe difference is one of incentives. One of these sectors gets your money regardless of how well they meet the needs of their customers, and in this case, regardless of whether they even open their doors for business.\u201d\nA number of different surveys have shown rising support for different school choice policies nationwide, according to EdChoice.org.\nAlthough, these policies are mostly supported by Republican legislators at the state level across the country.\nHogan has emphasized his support for school choice during his time as governor, issuing a proclamation declaring January 24-30 as Maryland school choice week.\nHogan also lit the Maryland Government House red in January to display his support of school choice policy.\nThe bill is scheduled for a hearing in the Ways and Means committee at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 The veto of a multi-billion dollar education bill in Maryland may be overridden this week, along with tax increases to fund it, as the state Legislature is expected to take up the three related bills by Friday.\nThe Senate is expected to override Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future education bill during its Friday session, after it was overridden first by the House of Delegates Monday.\nThe bill includes a 10-year plan that increases state funding to address issues of concern within the education system detailed by the Kirwan Commission.\nIf passed into law, HB1300 would increase teacher pay, provide additional resources for schools in poverty-stricken jurisdictions, expand prekindergarten, and more.\nMany local school and teacher advocacy groups, such as Strong Schools Maryland and the Maryland State Education Association, have backed efforts from the Democratic leadership to pass the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future.\n\u201cWe are optimistic that the Senate will vote to override the veto soon and get the Blueprint across the legislative finish line, which is just the start of this transformational work to support our students, educators, and schools,\u201d said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, in a press release.\nRepublicans oppose the bill due to concerns over the ensuing tax increases needed to fund it, especially amid a pandemic.\n\u201cThe last year has been challenging for all Marylanders and the last thing they need right now is higher taxes and increased costs,\u201d Assistant Minority Leader Matt Morgan, R-St. Mary\u2019s, said in a press release. \u201cUnfortunately, there are far too many legislators who don\u2019t understand how to lead or manage through a crisis unless it involves raising taxes.\u201d\nThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future would cost roughly $15 billion in total through 2030, according to a fiscal analysis.\nMaryland ranks 15th among states in per-pupil spending for education, according to educationdata.org.\nThe Kirwan bill cites income and sales taxes, along with gaming proceeds, as revenue used to fund the plan.\nThe Democratic leadership has two additional bills that would increase and establish specific taxes as an effort to fund the program long term, as the annual expenditure of the plan increases 273 percent from 2022 to 2030.\nThe 21st\u2013Century Economy Fairness Act, HB0932, which establishes taxes on digital goods such as streaming services, e-books, and apps, was passed last year and vetoed by the governor, but that veto was also overridden by the House on Monday. \nAnother tax bill passed last year and vetoed by the governor, HB0732, would have established the nation\u2019s first tax on digital advertising, in addition to increasing taxes on tobacco products. \nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones\u2019 office, D-Baltimore County, told Capital News Service the plan is for the House to vote on overturning the HB0732 veto Thursday.\nThe Senate then plans to overturn the vetoes on tax increases Friday in addition to overturning the Kirwan veto, Sen. Arthur Ellis, D-Charles, told CNS.\nOnce a veto is overridden by both chambers, it becomes law.\nRepublican leadership in both chambers have made clear their opposition to raising and establishing new taxes amid a pandemic, but Democrats have a veto-proof majority.\nMarylanders For Tax Fairness has led the campaign against the digital advertisement tax, arguing that a tax on big tech companies\u2019 advertising would lead them to charge businesses more, which would hurt Maryland businesses during a pandemic that has led to a significant increase in online advertising.\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s hitting big out-of-state companies, but in reality, he\u2019s swinging and missing \u2014 and he\u2019s going to hit his own constituents in the mouth,\u201d Doug Mayer, spokesman for the organization told CNS regarding Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. \u201cThere\u2019s not a law they could pass that could stop an out-of-state company from raising prices.\u201d\nMayer also said there could be potential legal concerns on whether the state can selectively tax digital advertising while laying off taxing other forms of advertising.\nThe House session Thursday and Senate session Friday can be livestreamed on the legislature\u2019s website, mgaleg.maryland.gov.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 A bill in the Maryland state legislature would require public schools to allow the usage of therapy dogs across the state.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s currently no Maryland-wide policy for these dogs.\u00a0\nUnder the law \u2014 filed in the House as HB713, and in the senate as SB419 \u2014 certified canines would be permitted entry to offer emotional and scholastic support for students.\u00a0\nHow exactly that should happen would be left up to each county board of education.\u00a0\nSponsor Sen. Ben Kramer, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service that having a dog nearby would be an ideal way for students to power down and relax in learning environments \u2014 and that the animals\u2019 unconditional love is invaluable for children.\nSchools would not be charged with providing the dogs \u2014 rather, the bill simply would allow the animals to enter schools with a trained handler.\u00a0\nSchool social workers from Montgomery County brought this legislation to Del. Michelle Guyton, D-Baltimore County, before last year\u2019s session.\u00a0\nThey said they had immense success with therapy dogs, but the lack of county or statewide guidance was an obstacle.\u00a0\nA dog lover whose sons had made use of canine therapy, Guyton was immediately interested.\u00a0\n\u201cWe really, really believe in this program,\u201d Guyton said.\u00a0\nTherapy dogs can serve a number of purposes.\u00a0\nThe canines can be used for emotional support, or, on some occasions, to help nervous students in the classroom, Guyton said.\nThe SPCA of Maryland\u2019s Wagging Tales program works with grades 1-3, and has 15 therapy teams.\u00a0\nAfter being in the classroom with the organization, Community Relations Director Katie Flory saw that uncomfortable readers became far more relaxed \u2014 and that their performance improved.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re reading to a pet, there\u2019s no judgment there,\u201d Flory said.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile dogs don\u2019t serve as a panacea, Flory said, they can help teachers and students alike \u2014 assisting with learning as well as fostering a comfortable environment.\n\u201cThis is a missing resource right now that I feel like could be really beneficial,\u201d Flory said.\nA common misconception is that dogs will be around throughout the day, Flory said, but that\u2019s not usually the case.\u00a0\nWagging Tales has found that targeting certain subjects \u2014 English, for example \u2014 or even going into a class at the right times, can maximize learning potential.\nUltimately, schools will be charged with providing detailed policies for how and where the dogs can be used.\nSpecifically, the bill encourages boards of education to consider guidelines for dog handlers, as well as offer detailed communication with parents and students.\u00a0\nThe proper definition of a therapy dog is complicated; they\u2019re not emotional support dogs, or Americans with Disabilities Act service dogs, per Disability Rights Maryland.\u00a0\nService dogs are typically trained to cater to handlers\u2019 disabilities, like offering support to blind people.\u00a0\nTherapy dogs serve an entirely different purpose, often providing psychological or physiological support to individuals other than their handlers, according to the Alliance of Therapy dogs.\nThese dogs, then, have to be more mild-mannered, and enamored with human interaction \u2014 preferring tummy rubs to strict discipline, Flory said.\u00a0\nGuyton drew inspiration and support from an expansive program in New York City, which saw positive results after having dogs in 55 public schools.\nTheir movement started six years ago, and as many as 300 schools in New York have shown interest; some of their members will give testimony during the bill\u2019s hearing next week.\u00a0\nA similar bill did not pass last year, when the General Assembly ended early, in Mid-March.\u00a0\nAt the time, detractors raised numerous concerns about the legality of dogs in the classroom.\u00a0\nThe Maryland Association of Boards of Education, for example, argued the law would \u201cunreasonably mandate\u201d dog usage in a way that is inconsistent with federal and state codes.\nMaryland state law allows service dogs to accompany individual students in schools under the criteria provided by the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Act.\nUnder the current law, how and how frequently students use the dogs in schools is decided on a case-by-case basis \u2014 with no standardized usage policy.\u00a0\nAnd, crucially, therapy dogs are not defined as ADA service animals, meaning schools have no standardized criteria to permit them.\u00a0\nGuyton believes that this year\u2019s bill is more specific, and eases those concerns for county boards of education.\u00a0\n\u201cI feel like those issues have been mostly addressed,\u201d Guyton said.\u00a0\nCommittee members will hear those concerns \u2014 as well as support \u2014 next week in bill hearings on Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0\nSome school systems have already explored the possibility of having therapy dogs.\nBaltimore County has developed a successful partnership with Wagging Tales, and some schools in Montgomery County have also utilized canines for comfort.\nA similar bill is also in the works in Utah\u2019s state legislature.\n\u201cDogs really just want to give love and get love,\u201d Kramer said.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 A bill in the Maryland state Legislature would grant school students excused absences for mental health reasons.\u00a0\nUnder the proposed law, students would be allowed to skip school once every quarter \u2014 without needing a doctor\u2019s note.\u00a0\nSponsored by Del. Alonzo Washington D-Prince George\u2019s, the legislation aims to alleviate mental health problems exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cRight now, we know mental health and mental illness is running rampant, especially among students,\u201d Washington told Capital News Service.\nWashington voiced concerns regarding the general mental health of students across Maryland.\u00a0\nHe noted that 70 percent of teens admit to experiencing anxiety and depression, that 1 in 6 say they have considered suicide.\u00a0\nA lot of these issues, Washington said, can be traced back to difficult pedagogical environments.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know the stress of school is a lot for high school students,\u201d Washington said.\u00a0\nSuch stress can negatively affect academic performance \u2014 as well as mental health.\u00a0\nTherefore, the legislation, HB0461, aims to also improve classroom success, as a better environment will facilitate better test scores, Washington said.\nWashington also compared the one day off to the paid sick leave teachers get.\u00a0\nHe believes that allowing students to have the same privileges would level the playing field and benefit both parties.\nWhile teachers are yet to weigh in on the bill, Washington said he hopes he will have their support given that he chairs the education subcommittee in the House.\u00a0\nThis is far from a new concept in Maryland; the Montgomery County School Board flirted with the idea of giving students mental health days in September \u2014 but never verified the measure.\nMaking the legislation, Washington drew inspiration and language from initiatives passed in other states.\u00a0\nIn 2018, Utah became the first state to treat mental and physical health equally for school absences \u2014 legitimizing mental health as a valid reason for not attending school.\nA year later, Oregon passed a law stipulating that students could have up to five excused absences over a three month period, with mental health among the reasons.\nHB461 is narrower, though, zooming in on mental health as a specific issue.\nSome believe that the bill could take valuable steps in addressing mental health among schoolchildren.\nDr. Sharon Hoover, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry and co-director of the National Center for School Mental Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said she thinks it will help destigmatize depression among students.\nWhile there are many ways to do that, statewide-supported change could be a solution, Hoover said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt at all to get states involved,\u201d Hoover said.\u00a0\nHoover would like to see further steps, though.\u00a0\nNamely, she feels that expanding mental health literacy to school curriculum would further augment mental health awareness and advocacy.\u00a0\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait for students to truly need mental services before we offer them,\u201d Hoover said.\nWashington sees it as a win-win for teachers and children alike.\n\u201cIf it takes one day per quarter for students to work on their mental health, I think that\u2019s OK,\u201d Washington said.",

    "content": "By CATHERINE SCOTT\nCapital News Service\nANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 After a two-year-long process, a family will be awarded a $3.5 million settlement from Maryland after their son, Jordan McNair, died during a university football practice.\nThe Board of Public Works voted unanimously during a meeting Wednesday to approve the request from the University of Maryland, College Park for the full settlement of all claims made by Martin McNair and Tonya Wilson, the parents of McNair.\n\u201cNo amount of money is ever gonna bring back Jordan to his family,\u201d Comptroller Peter Franchot, D, said at the meeting. \u201cThe McNair family entrusted the University of Maryland with Jordan\u2019s care and quite frankly, a number of people failed him.\u201d\nMcNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman for the University of Maryland, was hospitalized after he collapsed on the field because of a heat stroke in May of 2018.\nOn June 13, 2018, just 15 days later, McNair died.\nAn investigation into McNair\u2019s death found that the university\u2019s medical staff failed to identify McNair\u2019s symptoms, which contributed to his death.\n\u201cMarty and Tonya are relieved that this fight is over and to put this behind them as they continue to mourn Jordan\u2019s death,\u201d Hassan Murphy, attorney for McNair\u2019s parents, said in a statement on Jan. 15.\nMcNair\u2019s parents founded the Jordan McNair Foundation after their son\u2019s death to educate others on the signs of heatstroke and heat-related illnesses with hopes to reduce the occurrences, according to the organization website.\n\u201cWhile Jordan is not with us to build his legacy, as a family we are doing it for him. This is his legacy,\u201d Martin McNair wrote in a letter on the website.\nCurrent university President Darryll Pines announced in an email to students Wednesday a partnership with the foundation that will center on student-athlete safety.\nPines stated that Maryland Athletics has already implemented 41 reforms to enhance safety for student athletes after two external reviews were conducted on the program.\nMcNair\u2019s death also contributed to changes in leadership and administration at the University of Maryland.\nA few weeks after the tragedy, reports began to raise questions about a \u201cculture of intimidation\u201d and abuse under the then-head football coach, DJ Durkin, and the rest of the coaching staff, as reported by NBC Sports.\nAfter announcing his resignation as president of the university, then-President Wallace Loh decided to fire Durkin amidst growing pressures from fans, students, and alumni, Loh announced in an email to students on Oct. 31, 2018.\nThe university has since hired Mike Locksley to be the head coach, which is a decision that Marty McNair told ESPN he fully supports.\nIn addition, the board voted to approve a wetlands license for a project in Somerset County to extend natural gas service by installing pipelines under the Manokin River, Taylor Branch, and Kings Creek.\nSpeakers at the meeting against the project cited potential impacts to climate change as well as the belief that renewable energy would provide greater benefits as their reasoning for opposing.\nFranchot and others who spoke of their support discussed the economic parity and access to heating fuel the project would bring to Somerset County, which they stated is the poorest county in the state.\nThe board also voted to approve funding to the following:\n\n$121,735 toward the replacement of fire suppression equipment in the Maryland State House Building\n$889,200 toward the Sewer Sentinel Project to detect COVID-19 in wastewater and alert health professionals and citizens at risk\n$115,000 toward the Medical Cannabis Commission to add a contractor to assist in awarding additional licenses to meet the growing demand for medical cannabis",

    "summary": "Maryland legislation, known as \"Brynleigh's Act,\" aims to enhance protections for students with seizures by requiring at least two staff members per school to be trained in seizure response and all teachers to complete annual online coursework on seizure recognition. The bill also mandates that schools maintain up-to-date medical records and medications for students with epilepsy or seizure disorders, providing a consistent and prepared response to potential emergencies.",
    "content": "*Story has been updated to correct the starting school year in the 36th paragraph. \nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Brynleigh Shillinger\u2019s seizures started when she was just 9 months old.\nAnd when she started Kindergarten, her mother began lobbying for a law that would mandate teachers are trained to help her daughter if she got into distress at school.\nIn 2019, Lauren Shillinger, of Frederick County, called her Maryland state lawmakers about a bill.\nThe legislation would increase protections for children who experience seizures in school and mandate at least two staff members are trained how to medically respond.\nAll teachers would need to take online seizure recognition coursework every year \u2014 provided by the Epilepsy Foundation of America.\nThe bill has been dubbed \u201cBrynleigh\u2019s Act\u201d after Shillinger\u2019s daughter, whose rare genetic disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex, has caused her to have as many as 25 seizures per day.\nDel. Kenn Kerr, D-Frederick, has sponsored the bill, HB0370, noting that approximately 10 percent of people will have a seizure in their lifetime.\nHe and his co-sponsors are preparing for the chance that a student could experience one for the first time during school hours.\n\u201cThe likelihood that the first seizure will happen at school is pretty high,\u201d Kerr said.\nPer the bill \u2014 also filed in the Senate as SB0225 \u2014 those who respond will benefit from a Good Samaritan clause, thereby removing them from civil liability if they act responsibly.\nLauren Shillinger (left) stands next to Del. Ken Kerr, D-Frederick, at the State House in 2020. Photo courtesy of Lauren Shillinger.\nAdditionally, the legislation denotes that students diagnosed with epilepsy or seizure disorders should have a full medical record on file \u2014 as well as any prescribed medication ready to be used.\nThat\u2019s not something Maryland schools have offered before.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really an inconsistent and patchworked response to children\u2019s needs,\u201d said Lauren DiBitetto, an advocate for the bill.\nThe Epilepsy Foundation of America will provide all the necessary coursework, which will be free.\n\u201cIf an adult is in a room and a seizure happens, you can\u2019t wait for a nurse or other medical personnel,\u201d Abbey Roudebush, senior manager of government relations and advocacy at the Epilepsy Foundation of America, told Capital News Service.\nThe foundation has sponsored numerous bills in states across the country, as a part of its Seizure Safe Schools Initiative.\nFive states \u2014 Kentucky, Indiana, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois \u2014 have already passed similar legislation, and 18 others have bills pending that could address the same issue.\nAs of 2020, approximately 59,900 people in Maryland are living with epilepsy, of which 7,900 are children, according to a release from the Epilepsy Foundation of Maryland.\nSen. Ronald Young, D-Frederick, the Senate sponsor, said he hopes that this bill would help protect those 7,900.\n\u201cBrynleigh\u2019s Act helps ensure that students with seizure disorders have the resources they need to go to school without fear for their safety,\u201d Young said in a release.\nThe bill also aims to inform students identify signs of a seizure and the appropriate response.\nThere are numerous types of seizures, and they are often mistaken with fainting, or in some cases, simply daydreaming.\n\u201cWe need to know the signs of seizures,\u201d said Diana Briemann, an educator at Anne Arundel County Schools.\nShillinger said she was also concerned about the stigmas surrounding epilepsy.\nPer the American Academy of Pediatrics, seizures are one of the three most common emergencies in schools across America, yet there\u2019s a lack of understanding about them.\nFor young children, especially in school environments, overcoming those stigmas can be difficult.\n\u201cEveryone has something going on. Brynleigh\u2019s is TSC and epilepsy,\u201d Shillinger said.\nA state nursing association supports the legislation, pointing out that not every school in Maryland has a full-time nurse on staff.\n\u201cUntil Maryland can have a full time registered school nurse in every school building all day and every day, it\u2019s important to have measures in place to keep children like Brynleigh\u2026 safe,\u201d said Kristy Gorman, president of the Maryland Association of School Nurses.\nStill, the bill has its skeptics. Numerous state legislators voiced concerns regarding emphasizing seizure disorders over other common conditions, such as diabetes.\n\u201cI like a lot of stuff in this bill and it makes a lot of sense,\u201d Del. Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, said at a virtual hearing Wednesday. \u201cBut I do think it needs some amendments.\u201d\nLuedtke said the Good Samaritan clause in the bill may need clarification as that provision already exists in Maryland.\nShillinger said she\u2019d be open to changes.\nKerr and Young introduced a similar bill last year, but it was put on hold due to the shortened session brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey changed some specifics of the law, opting that only two people at every school need to be trained in seizure response \u2014 a shift from last year\u2019s proposal that every teacher had to be educated immediately.\nIf passed, it would take effect in the 2022-23 academic year.\n\u201cWe just want her and others to be able to be safe,\u201d Shillinger said.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Maryland high schools may soon be required to adopt a curriculum on gambling addiction, depending on the fate of one bill in the state legislature.\nSB0243, sponsored by Sen. Bryan Simonaire, R-Anne Arundel, directs the Maryland State Department of Education to develop a program for local schools to teach high school students the dangers of gambling.\nLocal school districts would have the option to use an existing gambling curriculum or to establish a new curriculum, according to Simonaire.\n\u201cFrom a governmental policy standpoint, the state receives money from gambling revenues that can be used to help other priorities in our state, but also adversely enables many citizens to become gambling addicts, which creates other issues for the state,\u201d he told Capital News Service.\nSimonaire cited numerous studies in arguing the need for required education on the risks of gambling.\nMultiple studies have shown that people aged 18 to 34 are at the highest risk of developing a gambling addiction.\nThe risk of gambling addiction is higher among those in lower socioeconomic classes and increases the earlier they begin gambling in adolescence, according to the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, in Australia.\nThe Maryland Health Department raises revenue to treat gambling addiction through the Problem Gambling Fund.\nAnnual payments of $425 per slot machine and $500 per table game go to this fund every year, according to Maryland law.\nSimonaire expressed support for these funds but said there should be a greater focus on educating young people before they get addicted.\nSimonaire proposed a similar bill last year that was passed nearly unanimously by the Senate but was not voted on in the House of Delegates due to the early ending of the legislative session amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis year\u2019s bill is identical to the amended version from last year, according to Simonaire.\n\u201cI have worked extremely hard to provide consensus among the stakeholders,\u201d he told Capital News Service. \u201cAt this point, I believe there won\u2019t be any opposition to the bill this year.\u201d\nTwo lawmakers opposed Simonaire\u2019s bill last year: Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s, and Sen. Cheryl Kagan, D-Montgomery.\nKagan told Capital News Service that she will oppose the bill again this year.\n\u201cIt is a widely held philosophy that the state should not mandate curriculum requirements on our 24 local school systems,\u201d she told Capital News Service. \u201cOur Local Boards of Education were elected to represent their communities and are best equipped to decide the curriculum for students in their county.\u201d\nPinsky, who is the chair of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee, did not respond for comment on whether he will oppose the bill again.\nSimonaire told the committee during a Wednesday meeting that the Maryland Association of Boards of Education will no longer be opposing his bill as it did last year.\n\nHowever, there is still hesitation from some local school districts to adopt a statewide required curriculum.\nThe Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners and Anne Arundel County Public School system each had a spokesperson testify against the bill last year.\nA spokesperson for each group told Capital News Service that they will continue to oppose the bill this year.\nThe Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners provided Capital News Service with its written testimony against this year\u2019s bill, stating that the school system does not want a new, mandated curriculum to take time away from other health topics such as opioids, abuse, consent, and healthy eating.\nMaryland has a deep history of gambling that goes back to the local popularity of the centuries-old tradition of horse racing.\nHorse racing became legal in Maryland in 1870 and regulations were established in 1912, according to Maryland Matters.\nRegulation of modern forms of gambling have been established in recent decades: The state lottery was approved in 1972 and casinos in 2008.\nMaryland voters approved of legalized sports betting on the ballot in November via Question 2 with the implication that the government revenue goes to education.\nSimonaire told the Capital News Service that he hopes for his bill to be voted on in the Senate by the end of January.\nIf passed, the local curriculums will begin being taught in the 2022\u20132023 school year, according to the bill.",

This situation is common among eldest children in families where parents must work outside the home during the public health crisis, highlighting the need for emotional and academic support for these adolescents.",
    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 A year ago, Katherine Banegas-Bonilla, 17, had to worry only about managing her classes at Baltimore City College, one of Baltimore\u2019s top high schools. Now, the pandemic has forced her to be a short-order cook, housekeeper, laundry supervisor, tutor, translator, tech consultant, baby-sitter \u2014 actually, a third parent.\nMost days, she\u2019s fine with the work. It\u2019s just how her life is these days.\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest, and I have little cousins so they come to my house, and then I have to help them too,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cThen I have to help my little brother with his work all the time, so sometimes I don\u2019t have time to do my stuff.\u201d \nAcross the country, students face challenges with virtual school, but Katherine is one of the many teenagers who are burdened with additional responsibilities because they are the oldest child. While managing her eight classes, Katherine is also expected to run the house and help her younger relatives, whose first language is Spanish, keep up with their online classes. \n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s stressing because depending on how much school work I get and then the work I have to do at home, it stresses me out,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cSometimes, though, it\u2019s just fine.\u201d \nKatherine\u2019s mother, Nancy, works at a candy factory.  Her father, Santos, is a construction worker. During the week, Katherine is left in charge of their East Baltimore home. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that elder siblings are shouldering more responsibilities at home during this public health crisis,\u201d said Tammi Fleming, senior associate at the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a Baltimore-based national philanthropy that focuses on child and family well-being. \n\u201cThis is especially the case for families where the parents must work outside of the home,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd though these young people are stepping up to the plate and pitching in with caring for their siblings, it\u2019s important that they have the emotional and academic support they need for their own studies and personal needs. They need to be cared for, too.\u201d\nNatasha Escobar, a Spanish teacher at City College, has heard from her students that balancing household and academic responsibilities has been challenging. Back in the spring, when school first moved online, Escobar had students tell her that they were the oldest in their households and were expected to take care of their younger siblings.\n\u201cI think a lot of kids feel very overwhelmed right now, and everybody is coping differently,\u201d Escobar said. She has seen more of her students struggle with anxiety, depression and isolation because of the pandemic. \nKatherine says she has not faced those problems, though her schedule leaves her worn out. And the virtual class format, combined with her household responsibilities, have impaired her schoolwork.\nBaltimore City College has high standards, and Katherine\u2019s middle school assistant principal urged her to go there. It is the only high school in the city to offer the rigorous International Baccalaureate (IB) program from ninth through 12th grade, and all students are required to take IB classes. In May, Katherine will graduate and receive her high school diploma. She also will have completed 27 college credits\nBut getting through school has become harder since classes have gone virtual.\nKatherine said she used to get a lot more work done when she went to school in person. Now, she tends to push off assignments.\n\u201cRight now, I feel like sometimes when it\u2019s really late, I\u2019m tired,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cI should just do the work tomorrow, so I wait, and then I get all of these assignments overdue.\u201d \nHer Spanish teacher, Franca Muller Paz, noticed that Katherine missed some deadlines during the second quarter.\n\u201cShe is the person making sure all her siblings are doing what they need to do, making sure that they\u2019re able to be connected,\u201d Muller Paz said. \u201c I think there\u2019s a lot of her kind of sacrificing her own academics to make sure that her younger siblings have everything they need, and that\u2019s really been who Katherine is for a long time.\u201d\nKatherine\u2019s brother Brayan, who is just a year younger, only has to keep his room clean and do his own laundry.  She has been given many more tasks. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a girl,\u201d Katherine said. \nAt City College, Katherine takes four 60-minute classes each day. This year, she\u2019s taking Spanish, physics, history, theory of knowledge, English, social anthropology, math analysis and an extracurricular class that alternates between photography and SOMOS, Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society. \nShe failed three of her classes in the second quarter, which doesn\u2019t doom her chances of graduation. If classes were in person, she thinks she would have performed better. \n \u201cIt\u2019s hard for you to explain to your teacher and show them what you are thinking and what they are thinking,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you ask a question and then she tries to answer it, but when she tries to do so, she gets questions from other students. She doesn\u2019t [end up] answering the question.\u201d \nOne of the classes she failed was English. English has always been a challenging subject for Katherine. She was born in Honduras and moved to the U.S. when she was 11. She quickly became her parents personal translator. \n\u201cMy parents actually started taking me to the store and I was the one who was supposed to pay for stuff,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cThey were always like, you need to practice your English, and now I\u2019m their personal translator,\u201d Katherine said. \nThat was just the beginning of her obligations. Today, she has many more.\n5 a.m. \nKatherine\u2019s alarm goes off. Her father and brothers, Elvis, 8, and Brayan, are still cozied up in their beds. She meets her mother in the kitchen so they can start making her father\u2019s lunch, which some days is chicken and rice.  \nBoth of them are still half asleep, so the conversation is limited.\nAt 6 a.m., after her father\u2019s meal is packed away, Katherine\u2019s mother heads for work. Katherine has coffee ready for her father when he is up and getting ready to leave too.\nEvery other day, Katherine tackles her family\u2019s laundry. She also takes the time to tidy up the house and make sure she has finished all her assignments before school starts. She doesn\u2019t always have the energy to finish them at night. \n8:30 a.m.\nAt least three days a week, a cousin who lives nearby drops her four younger siblings off at Katherine\u2019s house for the day so Katherine can help them navigate virtual learning.\nThe oldest cousin is in sixth grade, and the youngest is in first. The cousins recently immigrated from Honduras, and now the families live just a 10-minute walk away from one another in the East Baltimore neighborhood of  Ellwood Park/Monument.\n\u201cWe all grew up together back in Honduras, so it\u2019s like we\u2019ve always had that connection,\u201d Katherine said. \nThey gather at Katherine\u2019s house because Wi-Fi is stronger there but mostly because the children need a translator. Many Baltimore households don\u2019t have a reliable internet connection that is crucial for online education. According to a 2018 report by the Abell Foundation, 40.7% of Baltimore households did not have wireline internet service.\nBefore the cousins arrive, Katherine sets up their work stations, strategically placing the youngest closest to her and Katherine\u2019s 16-year-old brother and making sure no one is sitting next to someone who might distract them.\n\u201cI know how to separate them,\u201d Katherine said. \nIf the cousins haven\u2019t eaten, Katherine makes something for breakfast before it is time to log onto Google Classroom. It takes her nearly half an hour \u2013 about five minutes for each cousin and her 8-year-old brother \u2013 to get them into their Zoom classes.\nSchool starts for all of them at 9 a.m. Her cousins begin asking for help when their teachers ask them to sign into other applications. Sometimes Katherine has to text their teachers to get codes and log-in information for the cousins while she is in the middle of her own classes.\nAll seven students use their own laptops and the same Wi-Fi connection. The sheer number of devices connected to the internet can cause it to glitch and slow down. \nOne day, Katherine was taking a test in her physics class when the Zoom call dropped. The word \u201creconnecting\u201d appeared on her screen, but her call never reconnected. The Wi-Fi had gone out in her neighborhood.\n\u201cSo I was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh. What do I do now?\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Katherine said. \u201cSo I emailed my teacher, and I told him there was an outage in my area.\u201d Her teacher was sympathetic and allowed her to use extra time at the end of the day to finish.\n11:20 a.m.\nKatherine\u2019s classes pause for lunch. She usually eats what\u2019s left from the meal she packed for her father that morning. \nAt 12:10, it\u2019s time for Katherine to go back to class. This would be easy enough except for the fact that her cousins\u2019 lunch period starts at noon. The kids bring lunch at least two times a week, but on the days they don\u2019t, Katherine must make something for them. On Fridays, however, Katherine opts to order pizza for herself, siblings and cousins instead of cooking.\nShe enters the kitchen, using her phone to stay connected with class. Wearing headphones, she moves around, heating up soup for the children.\nIf the soup is ready before the cousins are allowed to take a lunch break, she sometimes has to reheat it.\nKatherine knew nothing about cooking until she moved to the U.S. Her mother thought she at least knew how to make rice, but on her first attempt she ended up burning it.\n3:00 p.m.\nWhen school is over., Katherine asks her cousins and younger brother what they have for homework. If they have questions, they opt to stay at Katherine\u2019s to complete their lessons, as she is the translator. \nThen Katherine rounds them up, makes sure they have their devices and bookbags and walks them to their house. Katherine would have had her driver\u2019s license by now and would have been able to drive them home if the virus had not shut down her driving school.\nThere are days when Katherine doesn\u2019t want to have these responsibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s those days where I don\u2019t get enough sleep,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to do this like I do.\u201d\nOn those days, Katherine warns the kids to disturb her as little as possible. She also asks Brayan for help, or if she\u2019s having a particularly stressful day, she tells her 18-year-old cousin, Saira, she needs her to be there during the school day. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Please, I need your help today,\u2019 \u201d Katherine said. \u201cI am not so good.\u201d  \n5:30 p.m.\nKatherine makes dinner for the family.  But even when Nancy Bonilla-Galo gets home on time, Katherine is still expected to help out in the kitchen. Some evenings, her father works late, so the rest of the family may wait until 8 p.m. for dinner.\nThen she washes the dishes and cleans up the kitchen before she heads upstairs to do her homework.\n11 p.m. \nOn nights where she has a lot of homework to do, Katherine goes to bed between midnight and 1 a.m. On those that she doesn\u2019t, she goes to sleep around 11 p.m. Her alarm will ring at 5 the next morning.\nTaking a break\nFor Thanksgiving, Katherine and her family traveled to Manassas, Virginia, to spend the holiday with her aunt. Her mother suggested that Katherine and her siblings stay there for a couple of weeks and do their schooling while away from home.\n\u201cMy mom wanted us to take a break from school because we were stressed out, especially me,\u201d Katherine said. But the relief from her responsibilities didn\u2019t completely alleviate her stress. She missed her routine at home. By the second week of December, she was back home in East Baltimore.\nKatherine\u2019s parents have tried to stress the importance of college. They believe it will allow her to get a better job and give her more opportunities. But because of the pressure of her obligations, Katherine said she wants a break, a year off. She may not want to go to college at all.  \nHer parents think it will be a major regret if she decides not to go. If she does go, she said she would like to major in nursing or business.\nAnd if she had that business degree, she says she would consider traveling back to Honduras to assist her grandparents with their business, a coffee plantation that Katherine says that doesn\u2019t make a lot of money as \u201cprices are really low.\u201d\nKatherine does not want to stay in the United States for a long time. \u201cI hate it here,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cI just want to go back.\u201d It\u2019s been six years, and she said she still hasn\u2019t adjusted to life in the States.\nThat decision is months away. For now, Katherine is focused on managing her responsibilities and finishing her senior year.",

    "summary": "During the pandemic, libraries in Washington D.C. and Maryland adapted to limited capacity operations, providing essential resources while suspending in-person group activities and browsing.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged \u2014 but before everything truly shut down \u2014 Elyse Kovalsky\u2019s first stop was the Mt. Pleasant Library on 16th Street in Northwest Washington.\n\u201cWhen everyone else was freaking out and going to buy toilet paper, I freaked out and went to the library,\u201d said Kovalsky, 39, an employee at a non-profit in the city.\n\u201cI got as many books as I could physically carry, and I remember walking home and they, at some point on 19th Street, all fell out of my hands,\u201d she said. But at\u00a0that moment, going to the library \u201cfelt like the most important thing.\u201d\nSince the closure of many businesses and operations in March, many libraries in both the District of Columbia and Maryland have reopened and are now running at limited capacity. The revamped operations have introduced significant challenges and opportunities for libraries and their patrons.\nMaryland Library Association President Morgan Miller referred to libraries as \u201ca really important touchstone\u201d for many patrons.\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey data from 2016, more than half of respondents indicated that libraries helped them get information that helps with making decisions, grow as a person, learn new things and find information that is trustworthy and reliable.\nLibraries also provide crucial resources, such as educational materials, computer access and even shelter to their communities. In this way, Miller described libraries as acting as a form of \u201csocial safety net.\u201d\nThe DC Public Library system shut down mid-March and entered Phase Two mid-summer. Of the 26 public libraries,18 are open and running on a limited basis, while eight remain closed.\nFor the libraries running on a limited basis, all in-person group programs, such as children\u2019s storytelling sessions, have been put on hiatus. In addition, patrons cannot browse books inside the library, sit at a table or lounge area, copy or scan materials, or use the meeting or study rooms.\nDespite these restrictions, DC Public Library spokesman George Williams noted that patrons are still able to come in to pick up books that they have on hold, apply for library cards, send documents electronically for free printing, borrow from a curated selection of book titles available for checkout near the circulation desk, and use a computer \u2014 although the number of public computers available has decreased.\nIn the state of Maryland, there are 24 public library systems \u2014 one for each of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties, as well as one for Baltimore City \u2014 and each is operating in accordance with its own reopening plan.\nLibraries in some counties, such as Cecil County, have recently begun to reopen some branches with limited capacity, social distancing and safety protocols.\nIn the library systems of counties where the state has consistently been reporting the highest COVID-19 caseloads, such as Prince George\u2019s County and Montgomery County, all buildings remain closed to the public.\nMost branches in Prince George\u2019s County Memorial Library System and Montgomery County Public Libraries have been offering appointment-based outdoor pickup for holds placed online or over the phone.\nLibraries are placing a greater emphasis on their virtual opportunities, which they say have flourished in the wake of the initial COVID-19 lockdown.\nBefore curbside services and limited reopenings, patrons were essentially limited to checking out electronic materials from online resources, such as the Overdrive digital content library, so electronic media have seen significantly more traction with patrons.\nFrom mid-March to mid-November, the DC Public Library saw a 34% increase in checkouts and a 81% increase in holds over the numbers from the same period last year on Overdrive, Williams said in an email.\nThe digital transition has also led many libraries across the District of Columbia and Maryland to transition previously in-person programs like book clubs and children\u2019s storytelling sessions to online platforms such as Zoom and Discord.\nIn addition, Miller said that many libraries introduced new programming \u2014 often video sessions that teach viewers skills for managing daily life amid a pandemic, such as preparing restaurant-quality meals and promoting literacy in homebound children.\n\u201cWe saw this huge rapid rollout and proliferation of really high-quality virtual programming,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIn some ways, while our physical spaces got smaller and much more constrained, we became much more expansive, and in these online worlds, we ended up connecting with people in the community who we never had before.\u201d\nWhile these transitions to online programming may have seemed smooth for patrons, they required attention to detail for library staff \u2014 \u201cprogram by program, need by need, figuring out how we want to do it,\u201d said David Quick, the DC Public Library\u2019s coordinator of adult programs and partnerships.\nMany libraries have gone \u201cfine free,\u201d either temporarily or permanently, to minimize barriers to community use.\nMontgomery County Public Libraries advertises on its website that its library fines are \u201ccurrently suspended.\u201d\nPrince George\u2019s County Memorial Library System, meanwhile, committed to becoming \u201cfine free\u201d on July 1, noting in a press release its intent to ensure that \u201call Prince Georgians have equitable access to the Library\u2019s resources and services, while eliminating the financial barrier of overdue fines.\u201d\nAs for the District, more than 4,000 library cards were unblocked and more than 87,000 cards that had expired since April 2017 were restored, Williams said.\n\u201cOne of the things that the library has been doing for several years is, we have been systematically removing barriers,\u201d he added.\nMany patrons have shown an increased interest in learning about anti-racism \u2014 particularly after Minneapolis police officers arrested and killed George Floyd on May 25 \u2014 and libraries have been striving to help.\nWilliams said that DC Public Library data shows the top titles between mid-March and early November were \u201cWhite Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,\u201d by Robin DiAngelo, and \u201cSo You Want to Talk about Race,\u201d by Ijeoma Oluo.\nThe DC Public Library now offers unlimited eBook and audiobook copies of limited titles on race.\nSeeing a similar interest in Prince George\u2019s County, the library system there partnered with local agencies and nonprofits to host a virtual event in July featuring \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist\u201d author Dr. Ibram X. Kendi.\nThe event attracted more than 226,000 live views, according to the library\u2019s COO for communication and outreach, Nicholas Brown.\nSome patrons also have taken more time to explore genres that are new to them.\nBefore COVID-19, Kovalsky said she would stop in at least once a month, pick up books, browse the shelves with her two kids, or attend the weekend activities. Now she makes monthly pickups, but her tastes have shifted. Kovalsky said she had not read a book for pleasure in years, but recently began reading \u201cThe Refugees,\u201d a non-fiction book by Viet Thanh Nguyen.\nAriana Dugan, 33, vice president of product and enterprise at General Assembly, said she has been using the Mt. Pleasant Library more often since the beginning of the pandemic because \u201cit\u2019s a nice alternative to screen time for work.\u201d\nDugan said she also enjoys newfound efficiency: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more transactional, because I go online to sign the book, order it, and then just pick it up at the library rather than having that kind of browsing experience, and I don\u2019t super mind that honestly.\u201d\nShe has also discovered a love of non-fiction.\n\u201cThings that take me out of the here-and-now but are still in one way or another grounded in reality, I would say is a common theme in terms of what I\u2019ve been getting from the library,\u201d she said.\nFor some people, despite the libraries\u2019 enhanced cleaning protocols and changes, COVID-19 remains a concern.\nJulie Locascio, an attorney and long-time Washington resident, told Capital News Service that since the beginning of the pandemic she has only picked up one book from the library and has been very careful to minimize human exposure.\nDespite this, she wrote in a social media message to CNS, \u201cI have been super grateful at how many books I have been able to borrow electronically from the library.\u201d\nNot everybody knows the libraries are open.\nThe District library and city government have been providing updates through newsletters, government messages and notices.\nEven so, Kovalsky has come across several people who did not know the library was open during her walks to or from the library.\nThey would see her carrying books and ask her, \u201cYou\u2019re going to the library? Why are you going to the library? How is that even open?!,\u201d Kovalsky said.\nMiller said the pandemic-related closures may have made people realize that their libraries have much to offer.\n\u201cPeople were never aware as we wanted or needed them to be about just how much value and service the library brings to the community,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNobody thinks about it until it\u2019s gone. I think not having a library as they know it brought to the forefront of their mind how much they miss it.\u201d",

    ],
    "summary": "Maryland's public schools initially adopted varied approaches to reopening in response to COVID-19, with many planning hybrid models; however, rising case rates have since compelled most districts to shift to fully virtual learning. While some parents and officials support the gradual return to classrooms, others criticize the rushed reopening efforts for not adequately addressing the needs of vulnerable students.",
    "content": "As COVID-19 cases rise throughout the state of Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan\u2019s urgent tone has prompted nearly all school districts currently practicing hybrid learning to close their doors to students this fall.\nBack in August, state officials left the decision of whether to reopen largely up to individual county education executives. The state only advised that schools should consider limiting in-person instruction or close if their county\u2019s positivity rate exceeded 5 percent and the new case rate was over 15 cases per 100,000.\nAs a result, each county made its own plans for how to handle reopening and online learning. However, steep case rates have recently forced most schools to go fully virtual.\nMost school systems opened for some form of in-person learning\nWhile the beginning of the school year started out virtual for all Maryland public school districts, most counties originally had plans in place to switch to hybrid learning prior to January 2021 and many were able to welcome select groups of students back.\nSome school districts made the transition earlier than others. Washington and Worcester counties returned some students to schools as early as September, with other districts, like Kent and Harford, following suit in October and November.\n\u201cOverall, the feedback we have received has been that families have appreciated our efforts to bring back all students who wish to return to the classroom,\u201d Louis Taylor, Worcester Superintendent of Schools, wrote in an email.\nSome parents, however, have not been satisfied with the approach schools have taken to bring students back. Kristen DeBoy Caminiti, a mother in Anne Arundel County and member of the AACPS Superintendent\u2019s Parent Involvement Advisory Council, believes that schools are reopening hastily and are failing to prioritize children in need.\n\u201cI want schools open for the kids who need it, but I refuse to make everybody sacrifice negatively for a plan that is not serving anyone\u2019s needs well,\u201d Caminiti said. \u201cEquity is tailoring our approach to the individual needs of each child and not every child needs the same thing in order to have an equal chance of succeeding.\u201d\nFor Wicomico County Superintendent Donna Hanlin, parent feedback has been mixed. In the end, it was just about making the best collective decision possible.\n\u201cWe knew [starting out virtual] wouldn\u2019t make everyone happy, but we believed it served in everyone\u2019s best interests for health and safety reasons, while also providing instructional consistency for both students and teachers,\u201d Hanlin wrote in an email. \u201cAs for reactions from parents to students returning via hybrid model, it has been mostly positive, although a lot of parents also made the decision to keep their children at home because of COVID-19 health concerns.\u201d\nOf the counties that decided to engage in hybrid instruction, some began phasing students in based on grade level. Wicomico County invited Pre-Kindergarten students back on Oct. 19 and Kindergarten on Oct. 26, planning for other grades to return in the following weeks.\nA few school districts had students attend in person on alternate days. Talbot County Public Schools had students in Pre-K through Grade 5 return on Oct. 12 with an \u2018AA/BB\u2019 schedule, where students are scheduled to come in person on either Monday and Tuesday or Thursday and Friday. Wednesday was set as an asynchronous day for all students, with the same protocol kicking in for high school students on Oct. 19.\nWhile making these complex decisions, school districts have had to consider students\u2019 home lives and access to an internet connection, nutritious meals and other educational and technical resources.\nAccording to ProPublica, some Baltimore City students were experiencing difficult living situations that made navigating virtual learning environments difficult or impossible. To combat food insecurity, school districts in many Maryland counties are offering free bagged meals for pickup at numerous school sites.\nSome schools have already set a return date\nHigh positivity rates of COVID-19 have soared across Maryland in the past several weeks. Statewide, the positivity rate has risen above seven percent in recent days and has continued to climb, according to Maryland\u2019s COVID-19 Data Dashboard on Maryland.gov \u2014 reporting an 8% 7-day average positivity rate as of Dec. 3.\nState data updated Dec. 2 shows that schools across Maryland have experienced outbreak-associated cases in schools. Grace Academy in Washington County currently tops the list with 19 total positive cases, with the Glenelg Country School in Howard County and the Bullis School in Montgomery County following behind with 11 and 10 positive cases, respectively. \n\nWhile almost all Maryland school systems announced in November that they\u2019re going all virtual, some of them made the call sooner. Dorchester County was among the first counties in the state to shut back down at the end of October after Health Officer Roger Harrell announced that test-positivity rates in the county went from 2.9% to 6.1% in an eight-day period.\nSome school systems have already set dates for when they anticipate bringing students back into the classroom.\nPublic school districts like Worcester and Carroll are aiming to reopen for in-person learning in early January. Worcester aims to reopen on Jan. 4 and Carroll County has set Jan. 7 as a tentative date.\n\u201cWe recognize the importance of our students being able to return to the classroom environment, but the health and safety of our students and staff is always our top priority,\u201d said Taylor, Worcester\u2019s Superintendent.\nA few school districts are projecting a later start for in-person learning due to safety concerns. Howard County Board of Education has extended virtual learning for its school districts through mid-April at the earliest.\nLavanya Sithanandam, a mother in Montgomery County and local pediatrician, noted feeling disappointed in the Montgomery County Public School district\u2019s approach to instruction delivery.\n\u201cI think Montgomery County Public Schools has failed my patients, especially my minority patients, by not releasing a plan earlier,\u201d Sithanandam said. \u201cWe have documented a 30% increase in mental health referrals in our practice since March. A lot of children are coming in with symptoms of depression, anxiety, even suicide attempts relating to social isolation.\u201d\nJessica Hasson, a mother in Montgomery County and local psychologist, shared similar sentiments. Hasson noted that students are overwhelmed by virtual learning and stated that students with disabilities and younger children should be prioritized for hybrid education.\n\u201c[Young children] are not designed to sit in front of a computer\u2026 Mentally, emotionally, cognitively \u2014 it\u2019s not where they are developmentally,\u201d Hasson said. \u201cWe have the equity hubs, we have the educational hubs, right in the school buildings\u2026 We can use what [the schools] have done and have done successfully to bring in small groups.\u201d\nMaryland has recently surpassed 200,000 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, and on Dec 2, the state reported the most COVID-19 deaths since June.\nOn Dec. 1, Hogan held a press conference to comment on the rising numbers and ask for more medical professionals to step up to work at hospitals as capacity rose by 51 percent in two weeks.\nTowards the end of last month, Hogan ordered bars to close early, limited capacity at hospitals and nursing homes and banned fans from stadiums \u2014 all changes that went into effect Nov. 20.\n\u201cThis is not the flu. It\u2019s not fake news. It\u2019s not going to magically disappear just because we\u2019re all tired of it and we want our normal lives back,\u201d Hogan said on Nov. 17, during the time when many schools began to close back down. \u201cWe are in a war right now and the virus is winning.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 After Kimberly Vasquez\u2019s two younger sisters log into their virtual classrooms from their Baltimore home, there\u2019s barely enough bandwidth left for the high school senior to get into her class.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant conflict and battle, trying to get connected, trying to learn,\u201d the 17-year-old Vasquez said.\nHer family has Comcast Internet Essentials, a low-cost broadband plan for low-income households that promises no more than the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s minimum bandwidth for high-speed internet. But FCC guidelines caution that if several users are on a network simultaneously, the bandwidth that Internet Essentials provides may not be sufficient for video streaming on multiple devices.\nThe college-bound student said watching her grades fall because of remote-learning obstacles is \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and makes her feel \u201clike a failure.\u201d\nAcross the state in rural Allegany County, the mountains on either side of Dawn Vanmeter\u2019s home block a cell signal from reaching her family\u2019s school-issued hotspot, a device the size of a cell phone that acts as a WiFi router. \nSo each day, Vanmeter stuffs a backpack with books, supplies, a computer and snacks before driving her two granddaughters, Abby, 8, and Ayedann, 10, just a few miles away to her son\u2019s house atop a hill.\n\u201cHe has better access to the cellphone tower than I do,\u201d she said.\nHigh school senior Kimberly Vasquez sits in front of her laptop in her Baltimore home. The 17-year-old senior struggles to access her online classroom because the family\u2019s low-cost broadband plan, Comcast Internet Essentials, does not provide the bandwidth for her and her two sisters to stream teleconferencing applications at the same time. Courtesy photo/Kimberly Vasquez\nThese families live in two of the most digitally disadvantaged parts of Maryland, and are just an example of the thousands of households who have lacked the equipment or the internet access to attend virtual school during the pandemic. \nState officials since 2018 have been addressing rural access issues where broadband infrastructure does not yet exist. But lawmakers who say progress has been too slow are already earmarking legislation that would address statewide broadband access. \nIn both Baltimore City and Allegany County, the number of households without a broadband connection hovers around 40%, but usually not for the same reasons.\nAllegany County residents are hamstrung by topography that blocks cell signals, and a population density too low to justify the investment of broadband providers. \nIn Baltimore, broadband infrastructure is plentiful. But urban connectivity often comes down to affordability, according to state officials and city stakeholders. Broadband capacity may also be a culprit.\nThe burden of the state\u2019s digital deficit landed on the shoulders of school districts in March when schools transitioned to remote learning. And to keep children \u201cin school,\u201d officials across Maryland had to act fast to get computers and internet service to those without.\nStill for some, the Vasquez sisters and Vanmeter\u2019s granddaughters, the tools provided are inadequate to give them a virtual ride to school.\nThe chief information technology officer of Allegany County Public Schools, Nil Grove, said she and her team gave out 8,000 Chromebooks and 1,300 hotspots to families. But there were still students in the areas around Flintstone, Mount Savage and Old Town, where Vanmeter lives, who do not have the option of high-speed lines, and cannot get a signal through a hotspot.\n\u201cWe tried with most every one of them,\u201d Grove said. \u201cWe tried to see if  \u2018Oh, take the hotspot and put it in this window. Now let\u2019s try it in your bathroom.\u2019 \u201d But Grove said there was nothing more she could do for about 200 students.\n\nAt the end of September, the county bused approximately 25 unable-to-connect elementary and middle schoolers to Flintstone Elementary to use the building as an internet hub. \nVanmeter\u2019s oldest granddaughter joined them. The students connected to virtual class from their socially distant desks in the school gymnasium. Weeks later, the county allowed a few grades at a time to begin hybrid learning, with teachers coming in person to lead classes.\nBut as COVID-19 cases spiked statewide in early November, Allegany County officials sent students back home, including Abby and Ayedann. Wednesday the county reported a case positivity rate of 13.22% \u2014 the highest in the state.\nOne Baltimore technology advocate said addressing the problem takes more data than just knowing where broadband exists and doesn\u2019t exist; it\u2019s about knowing how efficient it is for those who have it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this voiced frustration from within communities that are saying, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting access. We aren\u2019t getting connected, even when we have a connection,\u2019 \u201d said Andrew Coy, the executive director of the Digital Harbor Foundation.\nThe former senior adviser to the Obama administration\u2019s technology and innovation team said the standard minimum FCC delivery speeds internet service providers, like Comcast, boast are inadequate and need updating.\n\u201cThese gaps are chasms, and they are going to have immediate and long-term health implications, educational implications, economic implications,\u201d Coy said.\n\nKristie Fox, vice president of communications for Comcast\u2019s Beltway Region, declined to be interviewed but wrote in an emailed statement: \u201cThe digital divide is a vast and complex problem that requires collaboration \u2013 with the school district, elected officials, nonprofit community partners, and other private-sector companies \u2013 so everyone is part of the solution.\u201d \nThe state so far has invested $14 million in partial grants projected to expand rural broadband to 15,000 households through its Office of Rural Broadband. Gov. Larry Hogan, R, created the office by executive order in 2017 \u201cto provide affordable high-speed internet service to every Maryland home by the year 2022.\u201d\nTo get state funds, jurisdictions, cooperatives or neighborhoods partner with an internet service provider and raise half of the project\u2019s funding through federal grants or in-kind donations. The office grants the funds for the other half.\nDirector Rick Gordon said that even though his office is \u201coff to a good start,\u201d challenges exist, like enticing service providers to expand into broadband deserts. \n\u201cI\u2019m an engineer, given enough time and money, anything\u2019s possible,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThe goal is to make sure that the time is managed and the money is being used appropriately to reach the end result.\u201d\nStill, he said, the office is on track to achieve their goal and to date the governor has given them the annual funds they\u2019ve requested. Gordon said his initial cost projection was $100 million to get broadband to around 71,000 rural unserved households. \nBut that projection is based on an FCC definition that classifies \u201cunserved households\u201d as those without the infrastructure for download speeds above 25 Mbps. Census data shows that, in fact, nearly 200,000 households in rural counties lack a broadband connection, regardless of whether the infrastructure exists.\n\nThe office focuses on the 18 of Maryland\u2019s 24 jurisdictions that are defined by state law as rural, and some rural portions of other counties. No similar state entity exists to tackle urban digital disparities. This year marked the first that the office directed funds into Baltimore in the form of federal pandemic relief grants.\nEconomist Alex Marr\u00e9 said it\u2019s key for states to have a comprehensive approach because broadband provides rural and urban consumers similar economic benefits, like shopping for low-cost goods and accessing healthcare and education. But rural areas are just that much further disadvantaged when it comes to the internet because the infrastructure may not even exist in their area.\n\u201cEven if everybody could afford an internet subscription, there\u2019s just not the fiber laid out there,\u201d said Marr\u00e9, who studies broadband infrastructure as a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, Marr\u00e9 said, has \u201creally just driven home how broadband, which used to be thought of as kind of this luxury 10 years ago; I mean, it is a necessary utility today.\u201d\nMaryland lawmakers interviewed by Capital News Service agreed that a statewide solution is needed and that it\u2019s time to start thinking about the internet as a necessity.\nAllegany County Delegate Jason Buckel, R, said the lack of connectivity is \u201cclearly disadvantaging\u201d his more isolated constituents. The government, he said, should facilitate internet access for all Marylanders as they do roads, water and sewer service.\n\u201cWe need the government to make it possible, and subsidize it to an extent so that the private sector provider could get that high speed internet real real close to our house,\u201d he said.\nDelegate Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, wrote in an email: \u201cState and private actors have been trying different strategies over the years to push connectivity forward, but none of it has been fast enough or comprehensive enough.\u201d\nIn the next Maryland General Assembly, Lierman said she plans to introduce legislation with Sen. Sarah Elfreth, D-Annapolis, to \u201cbroaden the reach and mandate\u201d of the Office of Rural Broadband to address disparities in all 24 jurisdictions, \u201cnot only so that every resident in Maryland can be connected to the internet, but also that every resident in Maryland knows how to use the internet.\u201d\nSen. Katie Fry Hester, D-Carroll and Howard, who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology and Biotechnology, said she will introduce legislation to address the per pupil and school staff member digital costs.\nExpanding the Office of Rural Broadband, Hester said, is important because \u201cneeds change, and the amount of work has changed, and it\u2019s not just rural broadband.\u201d\nPolicy advocates expect to throw their support behind broadband expansion efforts in January\u2019s General Assembly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the big picture, obviously, of how we can move the ball forward,\u201d said Drew Jabin, a policy associate with the Maryland Association of Counties. \nIn the meantime, Vasquez has taken matters into her own hands by becoming a connectivity activist. In partnership with Coy\u2019s Digital Harbor Foundation, she produces a podcast on Baltimore\u2019s internet disparities. \nAnd her student-led advocacy group, Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society, or SOMOS, in May sent a letter to Comcast with a list of demands, including faster speeds and free access for low-income families. \nIn its response, Comcast \u201cwelcomed a partnership\u201d with SOMOS to \u201craise awareness of the Internet Essentials program\u201d to get more Baltimoreans connected to the internet, and detailed assistance they had already established during the pandemic, like canceling late fees and providing two months of free service for new customers.\nVasquez says the mental exhaustion of getting repeatedly \u201ckicked out\u201d of her virtual classroom sometimes makes her want to give up trying to connect.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to remind myself that it\u2019s not because of me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019m not provided with the tools that I need.\u201d",

    "content": "ELLICOTT CITY, Maryland \u2014 Learning has changed in Maryland since the coronavirus outbreak. Teachers and students have been forced to turn to online platforms across all education levels due to the closing of classrooms.\nLast week, the Maryland State Department of Education extended its closure of public school systems through at least May 15.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the right decision for the safety and health of our students, educators, and state,\u201d Maryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost said, pointing to challenges such as technology access and food insecurity that hamper distance education for some students. \u201cThis type of learning is no substitute for in-person learning, and we will need to be thoughtful and serious about how we help students recover from this crisis.\u201d\nHigher-education institutions within the University System of Maryland and around the state had already moved to online-only at least for the rest of the spring semester.\n\u201cWhat we had to do was really set expectations,\u201d Montgomery County Public Schools spokesman Derek Turner told Capital News Service. \u201cFirst we need to focus on student health and wellness, and then we need to focus on what a new world of instruction looks like.\u201d\nK-12 education faces some of the toughest challenges. There is a wide array of ages and behaviors among students, and varying access to online platforms, according to Turner.\nMontgomery County schools have loaned out more than 43,000 Chromebook laptops to students in order to give them access to the online learning environments, according to Turner.\u00a0\n\u201cThe biggest problem we\u2019re facing is internet connectivity,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking for opportunities to make sure we are closing gaps in the digital divide.\u201d\nMontgomery County Public Schools has been working with Comcast to allow students to access the internet and has been purchasing hotspot devices for those who lack local connections.\u00a0 Lockheed Martin donated $25,000 to the school system toward the purchase of more mobile hotspots, according to Turner.\nKeeping to a schedule can also be a challenge \u2014 for teachers and students.\u00a0\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools, for example, published a suggested daily calendar for students. Each calendar \u2014 for elementary, middle and high school levels \u2014 gave guidance as to how students could tackle their days at home in the online environment.\n\u201cThe notion is that we wanted to build a structure for students that was flexible and provided structure and support for them,\u201d Anne Arundel schools spokesman Bob Mosier said.\nColleges and universities across the state took recommendations from the University System of Maryland, which on March 10 announced they were shutting down campuses and moving classes online. This policy has stayed in place for the remainder of the semester.\u00a0\nMany have attempted to ease pressure on students by implementing campus-wide changes to grading policies. The University of Maryland, College Park implemented a pass/fail system, Towson University implemented its Pass Grading Option and Salisbury University opted for a pass/no pass system.\n\u201cWorking in concert with some of the other University System of Maryland schools, it was determined that, for this semester only, that it would be a good option for some of our students\u201d\nwho have been disrupted by having to take classes online and/or the virus affecting their personal lives, Salisbury University spokesman Jason Rhodes said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know this is a stressful time for a lot of students, as well as faculty and staff, and we\u2019re always looking to do the right thing for our university community,\u201d Rhodes said.\u00a0\nRhodes also mentioned that Salisbury, and likely other University System of Maryland campuses, had a pandemic plan in place that was drafted when the avian flu and swine flu presented threats in 2008 and 2009, respectively, so the transition was not unforeseen.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve had to put that (plan) into action,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cAnd certainly once this is all over, there\u2019ll be a debrief about what can be done different, what can be done better, next time. But this is something that we prepared for and we\u2019re certainly happy that we did.\u201d",

Those hoping to become funeral directors must also take part in 20 funerals, while those aiming to become a mortician must participate in the embalming of 20 human bodies under supervision. These requirements would not change.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are having an issue where people can\u2019t start their apprenticeship until they finish school,\u201d Krebs said.

It allows them to gain more experience.\u201d\nDoyle added that the requirement of completing two-thirds of the educational program before gaining field experience \u201cdeprives (students) of the opportunity to know if they like and want to actually be a funeral director.\u201d\u00a0\nThis bill would allow students to figure out their feelings toward the profession earlier, save time and money, as well as make money while in school, according to Doyle.",

After the death of longtime Speaker Michael Busch in April, Jones emerged as his successor following a scarring fight among House Democrats that nearly saw their Republican counterparts essentially naming the next speaker.\nJones told Capital News Service in an interview that she\u2019s been \u201call over the state\u201d and in \u201cback-to-back meetings\u201d to prepare for her first full session as speaker. She said she will be a \u201cfair\u201d but \u201cno-nonsense\u201d leader.\nDelegate Kathy Szeliga, R-Baltimore and Harford Counties, told Capital News Service that she is \u201cvery excited\u201d about Jones leading the House. Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Baltimore and Howard Counties, said Ferguson will bring a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d to the Senate. Sen. Arthur Ellis, D-Charles, said both new leaders represent a \u201cgenerational shift\u201d for the General Assembly.\nThe General Assembly will have a number of priorities for the three-month session \u2014 likely none bigger than determining how to fund recommendations from a special commission that had been studying over the past few years how to transform Maryland\u2019s public education system.\nDuring its final meeting in November, the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education \u2014 referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan \u2014 voted to advance its plan that would phase in increased education funding over the next 10 fiscal years. In fiscal year 2030, direct state aid would exceed $10.2 billion, which is $2.8 billion \u201cmore than would be allocated under current law,\u201d according to the commission\u2019s proposal.\nThe commission\u2019s recommendations on improving education in the state include increasing teacher salaries and \u201cassisting schools with high concentrations of poverty,\u201d according to the proposal.\nNow, the General Assembly will debate how to fund the Kirwan Commission\u2019s recommendations.\nRepublican Gov. Larry Hogan has frequently chided the commission; in a November statement released following the final meeting, he said, \u201cAfter more than three years of meetings, the Kirwan Tax Hike Commission has still failed to produce any plan to pay for its massive spending proposals.\u201d\nBut Democratic lawmakers are confident that the recommendations will be funded in 2020.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna pass it,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher, D-Montgomery. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s the most important package that we can pass in this upcoming legislative session.\u201d\nMaryland Speaker of the House Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, stands in her office in the State House on Dec. 10, 2019. (Capital News Service photo by Elliott Davis.)\nJones said she is \u201cfirm that we have the funds.\u201d She added that with regard to the discussion around tax increases, the \u201cgovernor is the only one saying that.\u201d\n\u201cWe are the ones that sat on this commission,\u201d the speaker of the House added.\nSen. Jill Carter, D-Baltimore, told Capital News Service that she has \u201cconfidence and hope\u201d that legislators will \u201csecure a veto-proof piece of legislation\u201d to fund the recommendations. Delegate Darryl Barnes, D-Prince George\u2019s, said the debate over Kirwan is \u201ceveryone\u2019s concern right now.\u201d\nSzeliga, the House minority whip, told Capital News Service that Kirwan is a \u201chuge hurdle with the $4 billion price tag.\u201d She said that her party stands \u201cbetween taxpayers\u2019 wallet(s) and the teacher\u2019s union,\u201d which has put its strong support behind the plan.\n\u201cI hope that the leadership in Annapolis can utilize our reasonable, good math skills to protect taxpayers,\u201d Szeliga added.\nDelegate Susan Krebs, R-Carroll, echoed Szeliga\u2019s concerns, saying that while she applauds the work done by the commission, she\u2019s concerned about throwing \u201cmoney at something to say you\u2019ve done something\u201d and repeating \u201cthe mistakes of the past.\u201d\nPJ Hogan, a senior vice president at Cornerstone Government Affairs in Annapolis, told Capital News Service that the debate over funding the Kirwan recommendations is \u201cgoing to suck most of the oxygen out of the room.\u201d Delegate Jared Solomon, D-Montgomery, said he\u2019s heard that legislators are being told not to \u201cput bills in with fiscal notes\u201d due to the focus on education funding. Fiscal notes are prepared by the Department of Legislative Services to explain the economic impact of a given bill.\nBut House Majority Leader Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service that while the Kirwan recommendations will \u201cdominate a lot of the press conversation,\u201d there are many other items on the agenda for 2020.\nOne major item also has to do with education. Democratic General Assembly leaders announced last month a $2.2 billion plan to build and renovate schools across the state that will be taken up during the session. The plan, called the Built to Learn Act, was referred to as \u201cHB1\u201d and \u201cSB1\u201d at the announcement news conference. It will be funded at least in part by bonds from the Maryland Stadium Authority as well as dollars from the state\u2019s casinos, Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore, said at the news conference.\nAnd Hogan announced his own school construction plan this month, called the Building Opportunity Act. The plan would provide $3.8 billion in school construction funding over five years, some of which would \u201ccome from a share of casino revenues in the education lockbox,\u201d according to a news release distributed after Hogan\u2019s announcement.\nWhile education will dominate the session from multiple fronts, both Hogan and state lawmakers have plans to address other issues in the state.\nOn Wednesday, the governor announced a bill aimed at \u201csignificantly\u201d increasing sentences for \u201cviolent offenders who commit crimes with guns,\u201d as well as other \u201cmajor crime\u201d legislation, according to a news release.\nOn the same day, Hogan announced initiatives to address violent crime in Baltimore City, including funding for 25 new prosecutors, $21 million in additional funding for the city and State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d strategy to curb youth violence there, according to the release.\nHogan also pledged in a November release that he will reintroduce political redistricting legislation \u201con the first day of the 2020 legislative session.\u201d\nThe Republican governor has frequently spoken out against gerrymandering in Maryland without much success; the General Assembly is controlled by Democrats in both chambers. Krebs referred to redistricting as a \u201cfiasco\u201d and said she hopes it is addressed in 2020.\n\u201cLet a computer do it if we have to,\u201d she said.\nSome lawmakers told Capital News Service that they will fight Hogan on another one of his priorities: a plan to expand major highways in the state in order to relieve traffic congestion.\nSolomon, the Montgomery County delegate, said he will bring back a bill requiring an environmental study around the effects of Hogan\u2019s plan. Delegate Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, told Capital News Service that there also will be a bill that would require local consent for toll roads. \n\u201cIf the Maryland Department of Transportation is going to agree to the largest (public-private partnership) in the country, I think the General Assembly should have a role to play,\u201d she added.\nLegislators are also hoping that there will be a resolution to a lawsuit between the state and its Historically Black Colleges and Universities over \u201cillegal program duplication\u201d between the institutions and Maryland\u2019s traditionally white universities, according to November release from the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus.\nThe caucus organized a rally in Annapolis last month aimed at urging Hogan to increase his most recent offer of $200 million to be shared among the state\u2019s four HBCUs over 10 years, according to the release. Jones attended the rally and said she wrote in a letter to Hogan that $577 million \u201cis the amount\u201d needed by the universities. In a written statement after the rally, Hogan defended the $200 million offer as a \u201c500 percent increase\u201d over the final offer from the administration of Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. Multiple legislators told Capital News Service they expect funding for HBCUs to be a big talking point during the session.\nLawmakers also expect crime and health issues to be addressed in 2020.\nLuedtke said gun safety bills that passed the House but not the Senate during the last session \u201cwill be coming back.\u201d Senate Majority Whip Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, said she plans to re-introduce her bill that would regulate sales of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, in the state and has a \u201cgood feeling\u201d about it passing in 2020.\n\u201cCongress hasn\u2019t been able to pass anything,\u201d Lee said. \u201c \u2026 We\u2019ve gotta do something more than thoughts and prayers.\u201d\nWaldstreicher has plans of his own. He said that while Maryland has \u201cvery strict\u201d gun laws, there are also \u201cloopholes that we have to close,\u201d such as background checks and gun storage-related issues. Waldstreicher also plans to introduce a bill that would ban the AM-15 semi-automatic rifle, which he said is legal under Maryland law. Police say the weapon was used in the Dayton, Ohio, mass shooting in August, according to NBC News.\nThere are also plans to address the increasing health issues associated with e-cigarettes. Comptroller Peter Franchot, a Democrat, formed a task force to examine the \u201cpublic health and safety implications\u201d of these devices, and the group had its first meeting in December, according to a news release. The goal of the task force is to produce a report and submit related legislation to the General Assembly during the 2020 session, according to the release.\nLam, a physician, announced last month that he will file a bill banning certain flavored vapes, such as bubble gum and mint. He told Capital News Service that he expects pushback from the vaping industry, and said he feels that the devices are \u201cobviously\u201d targeting young people to \u201cget them hooked\u201d with these flavors.\nBut Lam also sees a \u201cgeneral concern over the state\u2019s budget\u201d to be a \u201cbig driver of things\u201d during the session, with major additional funding toward education being considered amid the possibility that the economy will \u201cnot be doing as well\u201d in the near future.\nIt\u2019s a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d Lam said.",

    "summary": "Student loan debt in the U.S. has reached $1.48 trillion, with federal loans making up 81% of this total and carrying lower interest rates compared to private loans.",
    "content": "Student loan debt has reached an all-time high of $1.48 trillion as of June 2019, and is expected to increase, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nRoughly 81% of this debt is composed of federal direct loans, as reported by Federal Student Aid (FSA), an office of the U.S. Department of Education.\nThere are two main components of student loan debt \u2014 federal loans and private loans. Federal loans are lent by the government; whereas, private loans are lent by banks and other private financial institutions. Private loans can have high, variable interest rates.\nFederal loans tend to have low, fixed interest rates. The current interest rate for both direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 4.53%.\n\u201cThe latest student loan debt statistics for 2019 show how serious the student loan debt crisis has become for borrowers across all demographics and age groups,\u201d Zack Friedman, entrepreneur and bestselling author of The Lemonade Life, wrote in an article published by Forbes.\nFriedman also stated that student loan debt is now \u201cthe second highest consumer debt category\u201d in the U.S.\nSome students, however, feel that there is a general lack of knowledge about the impact that student loans can have on post-graduation life.\n\u201cThankfully, I had the guidance of my mother, who calculated what my loans would be for each of the schools I [was] accepted to. She made the facts about student loans incredibly clear \u2013 facts I previously turned a blind eye to, thinking that finances and scholarships would just work out,\u201d Nichola Merkel, a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), said. \u201cWithout her, I probably would have ended up at an out-of-state school, ignorant to the debt that awaited my upon graduation.\u201d\nMerkel, along with other students at UMD, agreed that without the guidance from parents or older siblings they, too, would turn a \u201cblind eye\u201d to the debt acquired from taking out a loan.\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to have an older brother who went through the entire student loan process so my family was able to assist me with what sorts of loans would have the lowest interest and would be easiest to take out and pay off,\u201d Kathryn Ozeroff, a junior at UMD, said.\nWith or without family guidance, the balance of federal student loan debt is still high in comparison to previous years.\nThe balance of all federal loans in the U.S. and Puerto Rico is $1.36 trillion as of June 2019, reported in the Federal Student Loan Portfolio published by FSA. California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Tennessee are the top 15 states with the highest federal loan balance. These states alone comprise 66% of the total balance.\n\nColleges within each state offer different federal loan packages for their students.\nIn Maryland, Johns Hopkins University has the highest reported tuition and fees but has the lowest average federal loan amount per undergraduate student from 2017 to 2018 at $5,035. Washington College is next with an average amount of $6,206, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do any research prior to applying for a loan. I had a lot of support from my parents and they helped me through the process,\u201d Molly Briguglio, a senior at UMD, said. \u201cEven now, I am still very unaware of what the entire federal loan process entails. When applying to these loans, I went in with a very indifferent attitude because it is so common these days to have loans, and nearly every college student I talk to has some form of a federal loan.\u201d\nNCES reported that UMD gave an average amount of $6,395 to each of its undergraduate students from 2017 to 2018.\n\nStrayer University has one of the lowest tuition rates in Maryland but has the highest average federal loan amount at $11,238.\nBriguglio and Ozeroff, along with about 787,700 borrowers in Maryland, have at least some form of federal student loan debt.\n\u201cI try to look on the bright side of things and figure, if I\u2019m having to take out these loans to learn, I should then be more motivated and successful and ideally have a job that enables me to pay off my loans quickly,\u201d Ozeroff said. \u201cWhen I think about it that way, it acts as more of a motivator than weight.\u201d\nAlmost half of those borrowers have at most $20,000 in debt and about 21% have anywhere from $20,000 to $40,000 in federal student loans.\n\nAbout 10% of borrowers have at least $100,000 in debt.\nDespite having debt, students from UMD say that they hope to get a well-paying entry level position to be able to start making monthly loan payments.\n\u201cI am constantly thinking about getting a job in order to start saving up money for when I graduate,\u201d Briguglio said.",

    "content": "FOREST HEIGHTS, Maryland \u2014 Sen. Bill Ferguson, likely Maryland\u2019s next Senate president, stood in Forest Heights Elementary \u2014 a school shut down temporarily for safety reasons \u2014 on Wednesday, and said the building \u201ctells its own story\u201d when it comes to education in the state.\n\u201cWe can, we must and we will do better,\u201d Ferguson, D-Baltimore, said during a news conference.\nFerguson, along with other Democratic leaders from both the Maryland Senate and House of Delegates, and other officials, announced Wednesday a $2.2 billion plan to build and renovate schools across the state that will be taken up during the 2020 legislative session.\nThe plan, called the Built to Learn Act, will be funded at least in part by bonds from the Maryland Stadium Authority as well as dollars from the state\u2019s casinos, said Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore. McIntosh said the $2.2 billion total will be broken up into approximately $125 million annual payments.\n\u201cThis bill has nothing to do with taxes,\u201d McIntosh told reporters after the announcement.\nJake Weissmann, chief of staff to outgoing Senate President Thomas V. \u201cMike\u201d Miller Jr., told Capital News Service that determining the split between building new schools and renovating current ones will \u201cdepend on the jurisdiction\u201d and its needs.\nMiller, the first to speak at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, said the plan is about getting Maryland \u201cback to No. 1\u201d in education.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make school construction and school operating funds our No. 1 priority,\u201d Miller said. \u201c \u2026 It\u2019s going to be astounding.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s announcement further means that education will dominate the 2020 session, with the legislature also taking up recommendations from a commission created for the purposes of studying how to transform Maryland\u2019s public education system.\nThe current proposal by the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, chaired by former University of Maryland President William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, recommends phasing in increased funding over the next 10 fiscal years.

Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore, speaks at a news conference at Forest Heights Elementary School on Nov. 6, 2019 announcing a $2.2 billion school construction and renovation plan for the state. Capital News Service photo by Elliott Davis.\n\u201cWe will move forward with both because we cannot afford not to,\u201d Ferguson said Wednesday, referring to the commission\u2019s recommendations and the school construction plan.\nThe General Assembly attempted to pass a bill during the 2019 session \u2014 similar to the one announced Wednesday \u2014 that would have created a public-private partnership in Prince George\u2019s County allocating over $2 billion in funds for public school construction. The bill, known as the Build to Learn Act of 2019, died in the Senate.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan referenced the bill in an October statement that criticized the Kirwan commission.\n\u201cNo governor has ever invested more in our schools,\u201d Hogan said in the statement, while also referring to the commission as the \u201cTax Hike Commission\u201d that it is \u201chellbent on spending billions more than we can afford.\u201d\nMiller, D-Calvert, Charles and Prince George\u2019s, said Wednesday that Hogan wants to \u201cbuild schools, but nothing inside the schools.\u201d\nHogan previously proposed a $2 billion school construction investment, which he called in the October statement \u201cthe largest in Maryland history.\u201d\n\u201cWhile they are a year late, we are glad that General Assembly leaders are now endorsing our historic school construction plan,\u201d Hogan said in a statement following Wednesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cClearly, they recognize that we need to provide school systems \u2014 and most importantly, our students \u2014 with the healthy, efficient, and modern school buildings they deserve. Now that our legislators are finally making school construction a priority, I certainly look forward to working with them to get it done.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, said that improvements to school buildings are \u201clong overdue.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that student literacy is on a rapid decline,\u201d Jones said. A recent national report found reading scores among Maryland fourth and eighth graders in decline. \u201c \u2026 Students can\u2019t learn if their classrooms are deteriorating.\u201d\n\u201cThe 2020 legislative session will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make sure that every student in every neighborhood has a great public school,\u201d said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, in a statement. \u201c\u2026as well as expanded career technical education, increased educator pay, and more educators in our schools to increase individual attention for students.\u201d\nSen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s, told Capital News Service prior to the news conference that the announcement is part of a \u201cmajor push in both chambers\u201d toward school construction. Pinsky is the chair of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee.\nPinsky added that lawmakers want school construction to be \u201cHB1 and SB1\u201d \u2014 in other words, the first bills of the 2020 legislative session. A sign at the news conference, referring to the Built to Learn Act as \u201cHouse Bill 1\u201d and \u201cSenate Bill 1,\u201d reflected Pinsky\u2019s words.",

    "content": "Although the average college campus generates about 169,000 pounds of uneaten food every year, the College Park chapter of the Food Recovery Network has recovered over 274,000 pounds of food waste to date, and this number is still growing.\u00a0\nThe Food Recovery Network (FRN), a nonprofit food waste recovery organization founded by four University of Maryland students in 2011, donates uneaten food from college dining halls to groups such as Christian Life Center in Riverdale Park and, in the past, other organizations such as Family Crisis Center in Brentwood. There are now eight FRN chapters in Maryland and\u00a0 230 chapters across the nation, accounting for over 3 million pounds of food recovered.\n\u201cThe Food Recovery Network started off at the 251 North diner, so we recover from 251 every single week night, while we recover from North Campus Diner only a couple times a week,\u201d said Nishu Hosamane, vice president of FRN. In the past, the organization has also saved food from South Campus Dining Hall and the Adele H.

This includes protein, dairy, grains, produce and desserts.\n\n\u201cWe follow pretty strict guidelines when it comes to splitting up vegetarian food and meat so it\u2019s not cross-contaminated for people who are vegetarian,\u201d said Hosamane. \u201cThen we package up the food and we take it to the Christian Life Center.\u201d\nFrom there, Christian Life Center redistributes it to nine other partner organizations, including Meals on Wheels, Bread for the City, the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Day Center for Homeless, among others.\n\n\u201cIdeally we\u2019d like to [recover food] every single night at every single diner but funding is our main issue and that\u2019s why we aren\u2019t able to do that right now,\u201d said Hosamane. \u201cWe have enough volunteers for it because we have a lot of interest in volunteering.\u201d\nCompared to other universities, the College Park chapter is in the lead. The Towson University chapter has recovered over 12,000 pounds of food waste and Goucher College is close behind, with 7,000 pounds recovered.\n\nForty percent of food in the United States goes uneaten. This has a few implications.\nAccording to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), this uneaten food contributes to a loss of $160 billion per year. College campuses nationwide produce 22 million pounds of food waste annually, but some are making changes to divert food waste altogether. Trayless dining, which contributes to a 25 to 30 percent drop in food waste according to an Aramark study, as well as food recovery programs like FRN, are more common.\nHosamane is unsure if the amount of food waste at the University of Maryland has changed since she began volunteering for FRN three years ago. \u201cThe amount of food we\u2019ve gotten hasn\u2019t changed, but that\u2019s based off of the diners, not the students themselves and if they\u2019re consciously making an effort not to waste food.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland officials and lawmakers are questioning U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos about the high denial rate of applications for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which was established to forgive student loan debt for those who work in public service for 10 years.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and a coalition of state lawmakers have asked U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos why so many people are being denied by the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\nThe program, which was established by Congress in 2007, allows borrowers to have their student loan debt forgiven if they have worked for a qualifying public service organization for at least 10 years with 120 payments, according to the Federal Student Aid website.\nQualifying employers include federal, state or local government organizations, 501(c)(3) organizations and nonprofit organizations that provide a qualifying public service but are not tax-exempt, according to the Education Department.\nBorrowers first became eligible for forgiveness in September 2017, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. But even though 19,321 people had applied by April of last year, only 55 had been granted loan forgiveness, the office reported.\nCongress funded the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program last year to help borrowers who had issues being accepted due to being in a non-qualifying payment plan, according to the government\u2019s office of Federal Student Aid. A new Government Accountability Office report this month found, however, that 99% of the 54,184 applications under the expanded program had been denied.\nNow, Maryland officials and lawmakers are asking DeVos for answers.\nFrosh joined a coalition of attorneys general in sending a letter to DeVos in late August urging the Education Department to provide data to help states address issues with the program, according to a news release. A similar coalition asked the department for data last year, but the response provided \u201cincomplete\u201d information.\n\u201cThousands of Marylanders have committed to 10 years of service to their communities, because they relied upon the promise of (Public Service Loan Forgiveness),\u201d Frosh said in a statement. \u201cInstead of honoring that promise, Secretary DeVos has met them with confusing guidelines, lack of information and, ultimately, denial of loan forgiveness.\u201d\nRaquel Coombs, a spokeswoman for Frosh, told Capital News Service that the number of people approved for the loan forgiveness program is a \u201cwoefully small number.\u201d The data provided to the attorneys general by the Education Department indicated that 864 of 76,002 people nationwide who applied to the program since it began were accepted, according to the release.\nDelegate Lesley Lopez, D-Montgomery, led a coalition of 43 Maryland state senators and delegates in sending a letter to DeVos also asking for information about the implementation of the loan forgiveness program. The lawmakers discuss in the letter the \u201cgrowing body of evidence documenting that the Department has mishandled this program.\u201d\n\u201cThousands of Marylanders will likely not be able to receive the debt relief they were promised and will face financial hardship if this mishandling continues,\u201d the letter adds.\nLopez told Capital News Service that student loan debt is something she has been thinking about for a \u201clong time.\u201d She said that after hearing a National Institutes of Health employee speak about being denied by the loan forgiveness program, she decided to \u201cdig into it.\u201d It eventually became \u201creally clear\u201d that the program \u201cwasn\u2019t being managed in the way it was originally designed,\u201d Lopez said.\n\u201cEligibility was intended to be pretty expansive,\u201d Lopez said.\nNow, it is \u201cnebulous \u2026 it means nothing,\u201d she added.\nThe Montgomery County delegate said the current conversation is \u201cjust the starting point of a whole portfolio of bills\u201d that will address student loan debt in the next General Assembly session.\nAngela Morabito, the press secretary for the U.S. Education Department, said in a written statement that the department \u201chas been faithfully administering the complex program designed by Congress.\u201d\n\u201cComplexities in the (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) program include restrictions on the types of eligible loans and no authority to require borrowers to annually report their participation in the program,\u201d Morabito added. \u201cThe framework designed by Congress is confusing for borrowers, and we are working to make it as straightforward as the rules allow.\u201d\nSunshine Brosi, an associate professor in the biology department at Frostburg State University, said she found out about the program when it launched in 2007. She said she was told she was \u201con track\u201d for forgiveness. She ended up being denied.\nHandout photo of Sunshine Brosi. Courtesy Sunshine Brosi.\nBrosi said she was denied because she was in the wrong repayment plan. Later, the reasoning given to her was that she was working with the wrong kind of service provider. She said she thinks of these reasons as \u201clittle excuses,\u201d and feels that she has been \u201cmisled\u201d on the qualifications of the program.\n\u201cHow can 99% of people have done something wrong?\u201d Brosi asked.\nBrosi said she turned down a job with a higher salary so she could stay in a qualifying position for the forgiveness program, and even chose her profession originally because of it.\nShe added, \u201cI definitely assumed that my loans would be paid off by this point \u2026 People make decisions thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to have this thing paid off.\u2019 \u201d\nShahryar Rizvi, a Burtonsville, Maryland, resident and federal employee of 15 years, told Capital News Service that while he has not been denied for loan forgiveness, he has had his own frustrations with what he described as a \u201chorribly administered program.\u201d He would not disclose his employer.\nRizvi, 38, said the problem \u201cfirst and foremost would be the communication\u201d from the Education Department regarding the qualifications needed to be accepted. He has spoken about the issues with the program at town halls because he has been \u201cburned by it so bad.\u201d The application process, he said, is a \u201cformality and unnecessary hoop.\u201d\nAfter originally being in the wrong repayment plan, Rizvi said he is now on track for forgiveness and is three years into qualifying payments. Because of the strict requirements, Rizvi said, he has to stay in his current federal job in order to get his debt forgiven.\nRisvi added that while he does not necessarily want to leave his job, he wants \u201cthe freedom to search and leave.\u201d He said he does not have that freedom.",

One bill, sponsored by Delegate Pam Queen, proposes teaching students about organ donation starting at age 14, while another, by Sen.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Several bills progressing in the Maryland General Assembly would provide support for living organ or tissue donors, and educate high school students about becoming a donor.\nSponsored by Sen. Shirley Nathan-Pulliam, D-Baltimore City and County, Senate bill 954 could require county boards of education to begin teaching students about organ donation in public schools starting in the 2020-2021 school year.\nThat bill, and an identical piece of legislation sponsored by Delegate Pam Queen, D-Montgomery, are intended to begin teaching students about organ donation at the age of 14, before they receive their driver\u2019s licenses and decide whether they want to be a donor, Queen said.\nThis bill is intended to get more young people registered as organ donors to combat the long waiting list for organ donation, Queen said. The bill is also aimed to promote awareness of live organ donation, she said.\nAs of February 2018, there were 3,375 people in Maryland waiting on organ donations according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Almost 2,500 of these people are waiting for a kidney\u2014an organ that can be donated from a living individual\u2014transplanted, according to department data.\nIn May 2017, Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel, received a living donor liver transplant from his sister, Kathleen Bernhardt, according to a 2018 report from the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nQueen\u2019s bill, House bill 567, was heard by a Maryland House of Delegates committee February 21. Nathan-Pulliam\u2019s bill is expected to be heard by a Maryland Senate committee Wednesday.\nOther Maryland legislation, sponsored by Sen. Brian Feldman, D-Montgomery, would ensure 60 days of unpaid leave for a recovering organ donor and 30 days for a bone marrow donor if the donor\u2019s employer has at least 15 employees.\nJohns Hopkins University\u2019s Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation Director of Data and Analytics Allan Massie told a House committee about his experience as a bone marrow donor.\n\u201cIn 2013, I won a strange kind of lottery,\u201d Massie said. \u201cI was found to be a genetic match for a young child in Utah who I had never met, who had a terminal disease I had never heard of and who hadn\u2019t even been born when I joined the marrow registry,\u201d he said.\nBecause he works for a transplant group, Massie said he didn\u2019t have to worry about taking time off after the donation. He said that because not everyone has this luxury, this bill would be necessary to ensure that people can make donations without risking their job.\nAmerican Kidney Fund employee Shayla Harris said this bill would continue to encourage people to become living donors like her sister, who donated Harris a life-saving kidney while she was in college in 2010.\n\u201cOrgan donation saved my life and I believe living organ donors are real-life superheroes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere are thousands of people in our state that need a transplant and whose health and life could be improved by the generosity of a living donor,\u201d she said.\nEight other states offer some form of leave for either bone marrow or organ donation, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\nSenate bill 705 and a corresponding bill in the Maryland House of Delegates would also prevent insurance companies from prohibiting organ donation or altering an insurance plan based on one\u2019s status as a donor, according to the House bill\u2019s sponsor, Delegate Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery.\nAbout a quarter of kidney donors in Maryland have difficulty finding life insurance according to Massie.\nA Maryland Senate committee voted favorably with amendments Monday on Senate bill 705. Luedtke\u2019s counterpart, House bill 1284, was heard by a Maryland House of Delegates committee Feb. 28.",

This would remain largely unchanged under the legislation.\nStudents who have behavioral or learning problems would be given eye exams \u2014 regardless of their grade \u2014 when documentation of the problem begins, or when the school is notified of a medical change, according to a legislative analysis of the bill.\nParents and guardians of students are required to receive results of the screenings, and if a student fails, would be given additional information on how to follow up with an eye exam, under a 2017 state law.\nThe bill ensures students in the state who otherwise could not see the blackboard have access to success, lead sponsor Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, told Capital News Service last week.\n\u201cWhere learning is concerned \u2026 the ability to read and see is critical,\u201d Delegate Terri Hill, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, also a lead sponsor, told legislators at a committee hearing on March 7.\nBefore passage of the 2017 legislation, 50 percent of students who failed the screening never got an eye exam, and a significant portion never got the glasses, Hill told legislators.\n\u201cEarly diagnosis and treatment of children\u2019s vision problems is a necessary component to school readiness and academic learning,\u201d Latisha Corey, president of the Maryland Parent Teacher Association, said in written testimony to a House committee. \u201cVision screening is not a substitute for a complete eye and vision evaluation by an eye doctor.\u201d\nHowever, the government organization tasked with operating the program opposed the bill, because it would place a \u201csubstantial fiscal burden\u201d on the Maryland Department of Health, and would put \u201clogistical burdens\u201d on school systems, according to written testimony from Robert Neall, secretary of the Maryland Department of Health.\n\u201cDuring the 2017-2018 school year, 38,638 students received a referral after vision screening,\u201d Neall wrote. \u201cThe cost for the provision of an eye examination and glasses for these students could be approximately $5,449,688 annually.\u201d\nAn estimated 9,349 students in special education programs and 5,000 students in different learning environments were reported by Anne Arundel County Public Schools, the Maryland Association of County Health Officers said in a written statement on March 7. \u201cExtrapolating this to the population of the state, the annual cost to the local Board and Health Departments is estimated at over $20,000,000.\u201d\nBut according to a legislative analysis, the bill would cost the Maryland Department of Health an estimated $231,889 to hire employees to coordinate the program.\nThe same analysis said it would cost local boards of education and local health departments an estimated $900,000 a year to provide eye exams to students who begin a special education program or notify their schools of a change in medical history. This estimate did not include local costs for students who need behavior or learning intervention, who would also be covered under the bill.\nSome local boards of education and local health departments opposed the measure, saying it is overreaching and questioning the practicality of its mandates.\nThe \u201cunfunded mandate,\u201d would require \u201cthe hiring of ophthalmologists and a mobile van to travel between schools to provide services required by the bill,\u201d the Montgomery Department of Health and Human Services said in a written statement on March 7.\n\u201cWhile this legislation is well-intentioned, (Anne Arundel County Public Schools) has concerns with the requirement that county boards of education coordinate with the Vision for Maryland Program,\u201d Anne Arundel County schools attorney Jeanette Ortiz said in a written statement on March 7. \u201cSuch a responsibility does not fall on a county board of education.\u201d",

This year, the legislation is co-sponsored by multiple Republicans and Democrats.\n\u201cFamiliarity with computer languages is one of the few skills that can lead directly to high-paying jobs without the need for a 4-year degree,\u201d Jeffrey Jerome, chairman of a science and technology advisory panel for Baltimore County Schools, said in a written statement about last year\u2019s bill.\n\u201cThis proposal provides accommodation for students of different abilities,\u201d who are \u201cunable to process traditional foreign languages,\u201d Jerome said.\nMembers of the autism community are supportive of the bill, because those affected by autism often struggle with language, but excel with computers, Rose said.\nHowever, opponents say not learning a foreign language would be detrimental to students\u2019 understanding of world culture and chances of getting into college.\nWhile computer programming is important, \u201cMaryland students need to be prepared to participate in the world community both inside and outside our borders,\u201d Public School Superintendents\u2019 Association of Maryland Executive Director Renee Spence said in a written statement for last year\u2019s bill.\nThe role of \u201cCurriculum, courses of study or graduation requirements \u2026 belongs to local boards of education working together with the State Board of Education,\u201d not legislators, Spence said.\n\u201cWhile this bill does not increase existing requirements for high school students to obtain a diploma, it would severely limit college entrance competitiveness,\u201d Latisha Corey, president of the Maryland PTA said in written testimony for last year\u2019s bill.\nStudents who decide to use the option of learning a programming language for foreign language credit may be denied entry into Maryland\u2019s flagship university and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, an analysis of the bill said.\nRose said altering foreign language acceptance requirements is something both universities should think about changing, and stressed the bill would not require students to take a programming course, rather it would just create another option.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Maryland Democratic legislators announced Tuesday \u201cThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future,\u201d a bill that would provide funding for increased teacher salaries, improved teacher training and free, full-day prekindergarten for 3- and 4-year-old children in poverty.\nIntroduced by House Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel, this bill \u2014 along with an identical counterpart in the Maryland Senate \u2014 would allocate $325 million in fiscal year 2020 and $750 million in fiscal year 2021 toward funding the five main policy areas outlined by the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. \nThe panel \u2014 nicknamed the \u201cKirwan Commission\u201d \u2014 has been working since 2016 to come up with recommendations for education improvements across the state, Chair William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan said Tuesday.\nKirwan called his experience with the commission the \u201cmost important thing I have ever worked on in my life,\u201d citing the shortage of teachers in the state of Maryland as a major contributor to a lack of academic success.\nHouse bill 1413 would establish more opportunities for career growth among educators and provide them with salary increases in order to avoid the \u201crevolving door\u201d of teachers that some schools are suffering from, Kirwan said. The bill will also heighten the rigor of state certification standards for teachers, Kirwan said.\nThis bill would provide early support and intervention for low-income families, including full-day prekindergarten for children ages 3 and 4, according to Kirwan.\nThe blueprint will set a \u201ccollege and career readiness standard,\u201d one that is aimed to ensure that by the time a student completes the 10th grade (if not, by the time of high school graduation), they will have the English and mathematical literacy necessary to succeed in the first year of a community college program, according to Kirwan.\nThe \u201cblueprint\u201d will also provide pathways to free early college programs that would allow students who have met these standards to earn an associate\u2019s degree while still in high school. \u00a0The bill will also provide access to career and technical education for those who have met the college and career readiness standards.\nThe measure would provide additional support and services for English learners, students with disabilities and students from low-income families who have not met their college and career readiness standards.\nThe bill would also provide an accountability system to ensure that school districts are implementing the improvements identified by the commission, according to Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, R, underlined the importance of making sure the bill\u2019s accountability system is air-tight in a letter he sent to legislative leaders Nov. 27.\n\u201cIncreased funding and strong accountability are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they must be aligned to ensure that Marylanders are receiving a world class education and good value for the state tax dollars invested,\u201d Hogan said in the letter. \nStudents and educators, clad in red Strong Schools Maryland T-shirts, came to Annapolis to show their support. \nEleven-year-old City Neighbors Charter School student Mallory Lerch said increased funding and access to teachers would make for a better, more creative classroom environment at her school in Baltimore.\n\u201cI think our schools are really underfunded and we deserve more,\u201d Mallory said. \nThe Maryland State Education Association said they are in support of the bill and the school improvements and teacher salary increases it addresses, according to the president, Cheryl Bost.\nThough no hearing date has been set, identical legislation, Senate bill 1030, is scheduled to be heard by a Maryland Senate committee Wednesday.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Maryland\u2019s congressional delegation has voiced strong support for a sweeping plan to reform the state\u2019s educational system.\nThe Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education has been investigating how to improve Maryland\u2019s public schools for more than two years.\nIn a meeting in the House Tuesday with some of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, commission chairman William E. \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, former president of the University of Maryland, College Park and former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said the state\u2019s educational system is \u201cmediocre\u201d and more needs to be done to strengthen it.\n\u201cWe are at a huge crossroads moment for our state,\u201d Kirwan said. \u201cOne of the hurdles we have to overcome is the complacency about the quality of our education.\u201d\nOne problem the commission has identified is insufficient financial support for schools located in low-income areas.\n\u201cWe just aren\u2019t investing enough money as other states and other countries do in these schools,\u201d Kirwan said.\nThe commission is recommending expanding access to high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds and career and technical education for high schoolers.\nAnother top concern of the commission is the high turnover rate for teachers in the state. According to Kirwan, 47 percent of second-year teachers do not return for a third year.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said \u201celevating the profession of teaching as a high profession with adequate training and compensation\u201d is imperative to improving the quality of education in the state.\nThe commission is currently requesting $3.8 billion for the necessary improvements. Cardin said this money would be phased in over a ten-year period in a \u201cfiscally responsible manner.\u201d\nKirwan said he expects the Maryland General Assembly to address several of the commission\u2019s findings in the coming weeks. No significant legislation, though, is expected until next year\u2019s legislative session as the commission continues to work through the fall of 2019.\nKirwan said the leaders of the Maryland General Assembly are committed to considering legislation that implements the recommendations of the commission.\nThe delegation members made it clear that they consider education reform one of their highest priorities at the state and federal level.\n\u201cI think implementing the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission (has) to be the top, number one priority of the state,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said.\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, said \u201cthe greatest threat to our national security is our failure to properly educate every single one of our children.\u201d\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said in a statement that \u201cwe must ensure that every student has the opportunity to succeed, from early childhood education through secondary education.\u201d\n\u201cIt is critically important that we bolster school readiness and college and career readiness as well as address disparities for students of color and students in low-income communities,\u201d Hoyer added. \u201cThe delegation is committed to supporting the implementation of Dr. Kirwan\u2019s recommendations and working with local leaders and stakeholders to improve public education in our state.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 The University System of Maryland Board of Regents structure would be altered and its decision-making would be made more public under legislation the state Senate and House of Delegates are considering.\nThe two identical bills would make several changes to the composition of the board. It would add four members; the Senate President and speaker of the House would appoint one each, the state secretary of commerce would join as an ex-officio member, and a second student member would be added. One student member would be allotted one vote for one year.\nThe board\u2019s meetings would be live-streamed and an archive would be made available to the public.\nDelegate Ben Barnes, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, sponsored the House bill and Sen. Sarah Elfreth, D-Anne Arundel, sponsored the Senate bill.\nElfreth, who served on the Board of Regents as a student member, called the bill a \u201chealthy review of a state organization.\u201d\nThere are 17 members of the board. Sixteen are appointed by the governor to five-year terms and the student member serves a one-year term.\nThe measures are reasonable steps to add diversity to the board and keep the fundamental structure of the panel in place, Barnes said.\nThe bill would also open up the board\u2019s decision making to the public, forcing it to make public all votes from open and closed meetings, as well as votes from any sessions relating to the employment or termination of university presidents.\nThe introduction of these bills comes months after the board received criticism for its handling of an investigation into the University of Maryland football program following the death of 19-year-old offensive lineman Jordan McNair.\nMcNair died in June after suffering heatstroke at an offseason workout. His death sparked two investigations \u2014 both of which the board oversaw \u2014 into the football team\u2019s medical staff and its culture under head coach DJ Durkin.\nAfter a months-long investigation, the board recommended in October that the university retain Durkin, despite reports that University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh wanted to dismiss the coach.\nThe board met in a closed session the week before announcing its decision.\nAt the news conference, Loh announced he would retire in June 2019. And after widespread backlash from fans, alumni, and even Gov. Larry Hogan, R, he fired Durkin one day later.\nThe board announced in January that Loh will continue to serve as president through June 2020, and a search committee would be assembled to select his successor.\nRegents Chair James T. Brady also resigned following the saga, saying, \u201cmy continued presence on the board will inhibit its ability to move Maryland\u2019s higher education agenda forward.\u201d\nSen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, co-sponsor of the Senate bill and a former regent, said he has kept in contact with the board since the fallout.\nHe acknowledged the board made a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d but said it recognized its misstep and took action to fix it. Rosapepe said he was unsure whether there would be any pushback to the legislation at next week\u2019s hearings, but called the changes \u201cmodest.\u201d\nA House committee is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss House bill 533, while a Senate committee would meet on Wednesday for Senate bill 719.\nThis isn\u2019t the sole piece of legislation to be proposed as a result of the debacle at College Park. The House of Delegates introduced a bill, sponsored by Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, which would allow student-athletes to unionize. A hearing for that bill is scheduled for March 1.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Maryland lawmakers are proposing a bill to simplify the process of applying for federal aid for students who have no contact with their parents. \nReps. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, and John Sarbanes, D-Towson, introduced the FAFSA Fairness Act of 2019 in the House, while Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin will introduce companion legislation in the Senate. \n\u201cWe believe this is an important piece in making college more affordable for more students,\u201d Van Hollen told Capital News Service in an interview. \u201cThis is a small but important measure to help students who, for all practical purposes, do not have parents who can help them participate in paying for college.\u201d \nThe bill would apply to students who do not have contact with their parents because they escaped abusive homes, were abandoned or have incarcerated parents.\n\u201cStudents that have faced difficult and abusive life circumstances that leave them unable to contact their parents should have the same chance as their peers to apply for federal student aid and make informed financial decisions,\u201d Cardin said in a statement.. \nThe current FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) does not allow for students to apply under independent status. \nStudents with special circumstances must contact each college or university to which they applied and request a \u201ddependency override\u201d before their aid package is calculated. This process can be arduous and dissuade students from completing their applications, Van Hollen said. \nThe bill includes a key provision that would allow students to apply under a \u201cprovisionally independent\u201d category. They would instantly receive a conditional calculation of their financial aid award and complete the dependency override only with the school at which they are enrolling. \n\u201cThis bill will help prevent our financial aid process from continuing to be an unintended barrier to higher education,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \nVan Hollen said simplifying the FAFSA application process became important to Maryland lawmakers because of concerns voiced by their constituents.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing about the need to do this\u2026from students across the state,\u201d he said.\nCummings, Cardin and Van Hollen first introduced the bill last year as the FAFSA Fairness Act of 2018, but it did not pass the Republican-controlled House. Democrats took control of the House in January. \nThis time, Van Hollen said he expects the bill to garner bipartisan support. \nThe FAFSA bill is expected to be part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which Van Hollen says the House will take up this year. \n\u201cThe most likely route to success would be to include this provision as part of that larger bill,\u201d Van Hollen said. \nSeveral educational organizations have announced support of the bill, including the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators and the American Council on Education.",

Hogan plans to introduce a competing bill requiring local school systems to put the decision to start before Labor Day on the ballot for voter approval.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 After several days of debate, a Senate bill to effectively rescind Republican Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s executive order starting Maryland public schools after Labor Day passed 31-13 on Tuesday, with Democrats voting yes and Republicans voting no.\nThe governor said last week he planned to introduce a competing bill that says that any local school system that aims to start school before Labor Day will be required to put that decision on the ballot, giving \u201cgenuine local control\u201d over the issue.\nHogan said his plan to introduce legislation came after special interest groups painted his initiative as a \u201ccrazy idea of the governor\u201d to force schools to change, all while he was following recommendations set forth under a Democratic administration.\nThe executive order mandated the school year start after Labor Day, last 180 days and end by June 15, with five days additional discretionary days for emergencies or weather-related closures.\nTaking effect in the 2017-2018 school year, the move had support from over 70 percent of Maryland residents, Hogan said Thursday morning in a press conference.\nLocal school systems could set their own academic calendars, provided they follow Hogan\u2019s start and end dates and length of school year set in the order.\nThe move to start schools after Labor Day started in 2013 under former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, D, when a task force to study a post-Labor Day start date was established.\nSince then, five bills supporting school after Labor Day have been introduced, with bipartisan support from nearly 60 sponsors. Of those, 29 still serve in the General Assembly, according to a press release from the governor\u2019s office.\nHogan pointed to the task force recommendation, as well as independent polls from Goucher College taken in 2014 and 2015 indicating about 70 percent of Marylanders supported the later school-start initiative.\nPrior to Hogan\u2019s order, school districts had the choice to start school when they wanted, according to Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s. \u00a0\nHowever, when they had the choice, out of the 24 jurisdictions, 23 chose to start before Labor Day, said Pinsky, a lead sponsor of Senate Bill 128, which fights back against Hogan\u2019s order in this year\u2019s legislative session.\nHis bill requires that each local board of education set the start and end dates for the school year for public schools, along with repealing the provision that authorizes a five-day extension after June 15 without approval from the State Board of Education.\n\u201cWe are not telling people when to start school, we want to put it back in their hands,\u201d Pinsky said on his bill\u2019s goals during a debate on the state Senate floor later Thursday morning.\nHowever, Hogan argues that the Democrats\u2019 legislation \u201cmasquerades under the guise of more local control, which would do the opposite of what local citizens want and instead empower a handful of unaccountable bureaucrats and administrators,\u201d he said in the press conference last week.\n\nVideo by Julia Kim & Joe Ilardi\nPinsky also argued that Hogan\u2019s order constrains religious holidays, spring breaks, staff trainings and eliminates counties\u2019 flexibility to address local concerns such as severe weather.\nMaking decisions on school calendars is tough work, and the best decisions for scheduling can be made by the teachers, parents, students and support staff, said Steven Hershkowitz, press secretary for the Maryland State Education Association, which supports Pinsky\u2019s bill.\nIf approved in the House, the bill will take effect on July 1. \nHogan can veto the bill but the Democrats in the legislature hold a veto-proof three-fifths majority and can override it.\nHogan can also organize constituents to overturn the Democrats\u2019 legislation through a popular referendum, which requires a petition with signatures and support from 3 percent of registered voters in the state, calculated based on the number of votes cast for governor in the most recent election. \u00a0\u00a0\nHogan last week said there\u2019s a 100 percent chance that voters will gather the signatures they need to put a referendum on the ballot, with a majority of the voters in favor of mandating a later start.\nHogan released a statement on his Facebook page Tuesday, criticizing senators who voted to repeal his executive order after previously endorsing post-Labor Day school starts.\n\u201cIf that isn\u2019t blatant, partisan hypocrisy, then I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he wrote in a post on Facebook.\nHogan\u2019s competing bill will be introduced in the coming days, according to spokeswoman Shareese Churchill. It is unlikely to pass in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly.\n\u201cRegardless of the actions they take, legislators will fail,\u201d Hogan said.\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be the end of it,\u201d Minority Whip Sen. Stephen Hershey, R-Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s, Cecil and Caroline, said after the bill passed in the Senate Tuesday. \u201cThe governor and the comptroller might team up again and go to referendum, and maybe we can get the people to vote on this issue to determine what\u2019s most important for the state of Maryland.\u201d\nComptroller Peter Franchot, D, cited increased tax revenue in his support for the governor\u2019s later school start.",

The report also cited a Washington State Institute for Public Policy study that determined increased physical activity boosts academic achievement.\n\u201cThe parents think they\u2019re getting the P.E. in school, but they\u2019re really not, so we need to bring it back,\u201d said Walker.\nWalker, who was a National Football League quarterback for the New England Patriots in 1994, said 90 minutes of physical education a week helps with test taking, physical being and wellness.\n\u201cIt teaches you about how to socialize, how to be competitive, how to have confidence and how to overcome,\u201d Walker said.",

Larry Hogan, R, has allocated $235.8 million in his fiscal year 2020 budget proposal.\nKirwan said the commission is focusing on five major policy areas to be incorporated into the Maryland school system over the next 10 years: Investing in early childhood education; elevating teaching into a high-status profession; creating college and career-ready pathways; ensuring all students have equal access to education; and implementing an oversight board for accountability.\n\u201cWe have to think of this as a carefully quilted package of initiatives that fit together as a whole,\u201d Kirwan said.\nSteven Hershkowitz, policy director of the Maryland State Education Association, said under current funding formulas, free public pre-K is only available to 4-year-olds at income levels 185 percent of the poverty line or below.\nHershkowitz said with the Kirwan plan, free access for public programs would also include 3-year-olds, and expand to income levels at 300 percent of the poverty line or below.\nAn expanded pre-K program and revamping how college preparedness tests works by creating a 10th grade test that determines career readiness would create new pathways to success for students, Hershkowitz said.\nHershkowitz said the teachers union is more supportive than frustrated by the Kirwan recommendations, but said he is concerned about requiring National Board Certification for teachers.\nHe said there is no state that has come close to making all teachers reach the \u201cgold-standard,\u201d of certification.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a route that every teacher wants to take,\u201d Hershkowitz said. \u201cWe would like there to still be more options for teachers.\u201d\nKirwan told lawmakers that Massachusetts, which launched education reform in 1993, was an example for the committee\u2019s recommendations.\nThe changes increased state aid to schools, set higher goals for academic achievement, and required more accountability in the education system, three points the Maryland plan includes.\nHowever, Sen. Arthur Ellis, D-Charles, said in Massachusetts, minority communities did not excel following the changes; a study released in September found black and Latino students trailed behind white students in reading, grade and income level.\n\u201cWe have a lot of low income, minority, rural communities left out of the progress,\u201d said Ellis.\nEllis said Kirwan\u2019s recommendations of wrap-around services at community schools that provide mental health, nutrition and physical support in the school building would be a \u201ctremendous solution.\u201d\n\u201cA kid shows up and they\u2019re hungry, they\u2019re not going to learn,\u201d said Ellis.\nHershkowitz said Kirwan\u2019s planned investments into a community-school model would be prioritized for areas with high concentrations of poverty.\nSen. Jack Bailey, R-Calvert and St. Mary\u2019s, said a 2016 study showed recommendations for St. Mary\u2019s County would cause a 5 percent increase in funding, but still put them on the same level playing field as other counties.\n\u201cObviously we want a world-class education, but we want a funding formula that works for us, especially in rural counties,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWe want equality.\u201d\nKirwan said Massachusetts\u2019 shortcomings among minorities made the commission \u201cplace laser-like focus on equity.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned from what Massachusetts didn\u2019t do,\u201d said Kirwan. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave any kid behind, this has to be for all of our children.\u201d\nHe said equality was one of the most important recommendations, and told lawmakers that in the plan, more resources would be portioned to schools with high concentrations of impoverished students.\nFinding a revenue stream is the third stage of the Kirwan plan, and would be up to the Legislature, Hershkowitz said.\n\u201cEducation, education, education,\u201d would be the Legislature\u2019s top priority for the 2019 session, Senate President Mike Miller, D-Prince George, Charles and Calvert said earlier this month.\nLegislators have tossed around multiple ideas on how to raise the revenue required for the commission, from legalization of marijuana to sports betting.\nMiller and House Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel, have both entertained the idea of legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s (recreational marijuana is) the future,\u201d Busch said earlier this month. \u201cIt will be much like overturning prohibition.\u201d\nBut Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore, said last week she is concerned about budgetary consequences with the state losing an estimated $1.3 million to $1.5 million a day due to the government shutdown.\n\u201cI think we have to be careful, and we will be,\u201d said McIntosh.\nKirwan said he recognizes the General Assembly has to deal with the realities of spending affordability and said he hopes they will do all they can to fund the recommendations.\nKirwan said Maryland\u2019s economic future is dependent on a well educated workforce, and that high quality education is the only path out of poverty.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to do this,\u201d said Kirwan.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2013 \u00a0A tumultuous two days of statewide outrage directed at the University System of Maryland Board of Regents\u2019 handling of the probe into football player Jordan McNair\u2019s death climaxed on Thursday as the board chairman resigned and hundreds packed the McKeldin Mall here to support student-athletes. \nJames Brady, who is close to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, resigned after a closed-door meeting of the regents Thursday afternoon, just a day after University of Maryland President Wallace Loh defied the board and fired head coach DJ Durkin.\nThe rally, which was originally organized by university\u2019s Student Government Association, shifted its focus from protesting the board\u2019s recommendation to retain Durkin to backing the athletes, whose program is reeling from 48 hours of shocking twists and turns.\nCOLLEGE PARK \u2013 A sign at a student rally on the University of Maryland campus carries a quote from Ida B. Wells-Barnett: \u201cThe way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon them.\u201d (Albane Guichard/Capital News Service)\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to acknowledge how important we are,\u201d said track and field runner Jewel Smith. \u201cWe are just as important as the other students. And of course Jordan, the whole situation is very sad and we need to give our tribute because he was part of this campus as well.\u201d\nStudents, faculty, players and government officials voiced their anger over the board\u2019s decision to keep Durkin. Three players walked out of a Wednesday meeting with the coach. Some donors also threatened to withdraw support from the university.\nWhile there were many in the rally who were in support of the football program, there were others who wanted to boycott the upcoming game against Michigan State.\n\u201cWe are not in opposition to the football team,\u201d said junior Alice Smith. \u201cWe do not hate those people, we know they are students too. But we want to see change for them. We want things to get better for them. And I do not think going to the games is going to help that.\u201d\nOthers wanted to hold the Board of Regents more accountable.\n\u201cGo up there and demand that this Board of Regents answers to you,\u201d said former football player Akil Patterson to counter-protesters. \u201cThis Board of Regents calls on you. Answer their call. You are the future, not them.\u201d\nCOLLEGE PARK \u2013 A student was brought to tears by a student rally at the University of Maryland in memory of Jordan McNair. (Albane Guichard/Capital News Service)\nKaren Levenson, co-chairwoman of a $1.5 billion fundraising effort for the College Park campus, told the regents in a letter obtained by The Baltimore Sun that she was holding up future support over the board\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d handling of the McNair controversy. \nIndeed, Geoff Gonella, chairman of the University of Maryland College Park Foundation Board of Trustees, wrote in a letter to the regents board chairman before Brady resigned that the regents\u2019 action \u201cmay have dealt our efforts a fatal blow.\u201d\nThe board had undermined \u201cthe authority of the campus leadership\u201d and violated \u201cthe integrity of shared governance principles, including autonomy and independence,\u201d he said.\nThe board\u2019s move also \u201chas caused serious damage to the reputation of the Board of Regents and to all of Maryland higher education,\u201d Gonella wrote. \u201cThe board\u2019s actions will seriously harm the ability of all Maryland campuses to recruit future presidents and faculty if this is the governance climate they will face.\u201d\nThe university\u2019s provost, Mary Ann Rankin, and deans from every academic department released a joint statement Thursday morning, charging that the board overstepped its authority in recommending Loh keep the head coach, who had been on administrative leave since Aug. 11. \nIt was reported by The Washington Post hours before Tuesday\u2019s press conference by the regents that Loh had \u201cno option\u201d but to keep Durkin if he wanted to remain in his position.\n\n#JusticeForJordan .@CNSmd pic.twitter.com/lIUhj6cxnA\n\u2014 Zach Selby (@ZachDar61) November 1, 2018\n\n\u201cWe have been extremely alarmed for weeks by the interference of the University System of Maryland\u2019s Board of Regents into the university governance matters,\u201d the joint statement read. \u201cThrough its intervention, the Board of Regents usurped the president\u2019s authority and intervened in the ability of the president to carry out his full duties and responsibilities.\u201d\nFormer University of Maryland System Chancellor William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan and former regents board chairman James Shea issued a joint statement condemning the current regents\u2019 actions.\n\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, in the 30-year history of the University System, no board of regents has ever made decisions about campus personnel, except those involving the president,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Board of Regents should not be in the business of hiring or firing a football coach, or any faculty or staff.\u201d\nThey also urged Loh to reconsider leaving the university in June.\n\u201cWe believe Dr. Loh\u2019s leadership is critical for the university at this challenging time and we call upon the Board of Regents to publicly affirm its support for Dr. Loh continuing leadership of the state\u2019s flagship university,\u201d Kirwan and Shea said.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said Loh \u201ctook the appropriate action\u201d in firing Durkin and said the head coach\u2019s actions ultimately led to McNair\u2019s death.\n\u201cPresident Loh took responsibility for this tragedy and assured the McNair family that a full investigation would be pursued, which he initiated and the University System of Maryland Board of Regents took over,\u201d Hoyer said in a statement.\nHoyer also added he believes Loh should reconsider his retirement and continue to focus on putting the athletic department on \u201ca path worthy of respect and dignity.\u201d\nOther politicians, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore. took to social media to question why the leadership at the university was still intact.\n\u201cThe tragic death of Jordan McNair showed that there is a toxic climate at UMD,\u201d Cummings said via Twitter. \u201cI am not satisfied with the remedies enacted by the University System of Maryland to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\n\nThe tragic death of Jordan McNair showed that there is a toxic climate within the football program at UMD. I am not satisfied with the remedies enacted by the University System of Maryland to ensure this never happens again.\n\u2014 Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) October 31, 2018\n\nThe board ended its four-month investigation into Maryland\u2019s football program by concluding that it did not have a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d as was previously alleged by an ESPN story written by Heather Dinich. This contradicted a previous investigation that found Maryland culpable for McNair\u2019s death.\nHowever, the board did find that there were \u201cproblems that festered\u201d within the athletic department, Brady said Tuesday, and it did not give Durkin, a first-time head coach in his third year, the tools to succeed.\nThe board recommended that Durkin retain his job, saying that while he shared \u201csome responsibility\u201d in McNair\u2019s death, the head coach was \u201cunfairly blamed\u201d for what happened.\nThe board also recommended that athletic director Damon Evans keep his job. Loh announced his retirement at the end of the academic year in the same press conference.\nDespite the recommendation from the board, Loh fired Durkin one day later, after listening to concerns from the university\u2019s Student Government Association President Jonathan Allen and the majority of university stakeholders, all of which wanted Durkin gone.\n\u201cThis is not at all a reflection of my opinion of Coach Durkin as a person,\u201d Loh said in a statement. \u201cHowever, a departure is in the best interest of the university, and this afternoon Coach Durkin was informed that the university will part ways.\u201d\n(Capital News Service Washington bureau reporters Jared Goldstein, Samantha Rosen and Morgan Caplan contributed to this story.)",

    "summary": "Division III football players at Salisbury University often face challenges balancing academics and athletics, with strict academic requirements and less glamorous conditions compared to Division I. Despite these challenges, many players appreciate the focus on education and see it as a more authentic college athlete experience.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 For the third time in four weeks, the Division III football team at Salisbury University was making final preparations for a trip to face an opposing team.\nFriday mornings before a trip to another school are busy affairs for college football teams, but two defensive starters for the Seagulls had an extra item on their checklist: they had to take an exam for one of their classes they would miss that day. \n\u201cTheir instructor said they either take the exam today, or they get a zero,\u201d Salisbury head coach Sherman Wood told Capital News Service. \u201cTheir final (exams) will make up for their worst score. Well, if they missed today, their final would make up for a zero.\u201d \nThis is a common occurrence with Division III football programs, and it\u2019s an example of the stark contrast between how those division\u2019s schools handle student-athletes and how higher-profile Division I schools tackle the balance between the classroom and the playing field. \nAll three division of the NCAA stress high academic standards, but Division III is the only one branded with academics as the primary focus for student-athletes. While the athletic association\u2019s description of Division III highlights putting the student before the athletics, its promotion of Division I includes sponsors, football championships and a \u201cwide range of opportunities for athletics participation.\u201d\nThe pitch from Division III football coaches to high school recruits is simple: they will have the chance to get quality educations while receiving the experience of being a college athlete.\nBut being a football player in Division III does not have the glitz and glamour that comes with playing for a Division I team. The lower division teams take buses to away games instead of flying; professors are more strict when it comes to missing class; and uneven levels of funding for programs create irregular conditions for game preparation.\nMany players enjoy their time in Division III, though, and some believe it is the truest form of the student-athlete.\nCatholic University of America offensive lineman Kevin Zimmerman sets back in a pass block against an opposing defensive end. (Photo courtesy of Joey Gardner/ FotoJoe)\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Division I players are very athletically gifted,\u201d said Catholic University of America sophomore Kevin Zimmerman. \u201cThat\u2019s what got them to the next level. But I know their schedules are very maneuvered to focus on their athletics and not as much on their academics.\u201d\nRecruiting with a wide net and high standards\nDivision III has the largest number of student-athletes playing college sports in the NCAA. According the association\u2019s website, about 39 percent of all student-athletes compete in Division III in 443 active-member schools.\nAs a result, each team is a mixture of players of different backgrounds and talent levels. There are some who are talented enough to land on the fringes of Division II but felt more comfortable playing Division III; others have limited options or are just happy to be on a college roster.\n\u201cWe can have athletes who are high-end, and we can have some who really need a lot of work before they\u2019re ready to step on the field,\u201d said CUA head coach Michael Gutelius. \u201cBut because we\u2019re not worried about a roster cap, we can\u2026take a lot of guys.\u201d\nBut institutional requirements carry more weight when evaluating players. Coaches at Salisbury look at a student-athlete\u2019s high school grade transcripts almost immediately after determining they might be a fit for their program.\n\u201cIt has to be at least within our range,\u201d Wood said of the transcripts. \nIf a student\u2019s transcript fits the university\u2019s qualifications, Wood and his staff evaluate the player\u2019s character, talent and work ethic. \nBut schools don\u2019t always have a large recruiting budget, meaning coaching staffs have to find alternative ways to save money, like staying with family on out-of-state recruiting trips.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of for us to say\u2026\u2019Okay, you got family in Northern New Jersey, so you cover Southern New Jersey and Southern New York,\u201d Gutelius said.\nDivision III coaches search for the best available athletes like higher divisions, but those athletes can come from other sports. Salisbury senior defensive lineman Isaac Johnson spent most of his time playing basketball at Parkside High School in Washington and didn\u2019t consider switching to football until his senior year.\n\u201cIn Division III recruiting, you cast a wider net to see who fits,\u201d Gutelius said. \u201cAnd you have to\u2026whittle it down to a tighter group.\u201d\nStudent first, athlete second\nProfessors at Division III colleges don\u2019t usually make exceptions for student-athletes when it comes to attendance, and when they do, it has to come with a written excuse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s academics,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWe have to work around them. And we don\u2019t complain. That\u2019s why (the athletes) are here.\u201d\nWood had to stay after practice and a team meeting on Thursday to write excuses to 12 of his players\u2019 instructors for them to miss class on Friday.\n\u201cI get replies from instructors saying they received the letters and the kids are excused, so you get a few who are OK with it,\u201d Wood said.\nBut Wood added there are some professors who want to make sure important grades like exams are taken the day they are scheduled. For his players who had to take an exam before they left for Southern Virginia, their instructor allowed them to take the exam with her 9 a.m. class to make up for missing class that day.\nDivision III athletes have limited control when it comes to picking their classes; they have the ability to register like other students, but they have few options on choosing which semester the class falls in. \nSo, if a more difficult course is only offered during football season, they have to take it.\n\u201cI think the academics in general make the Division III experience a little tougher, especially during the season,\u201d CUA sophomore quarterback Brady Berger said. \u201cI have to go listen to lectures, go to classes to prepare me for internships. And you have to make sure you go to the athletic center for a two-hour practice, film study and weight-lifting.\u201d\nCatholic University of America quarterback Brady Berger is poised to make a pass as he looks downfield during a game. (Photo courtesy of CUA Athletics)\nAlthough they do have access to tutors to help them in class, passing the class is completely on the players.\n\u201cAs far as getting the grades, you have to be a man, get them yourself,\u201d Johnson said.\nZimmerman said he is currently enrolled in a class that has regular quizzes on Fridays, so he\u2019s had to miss \u201ca handful\u201d of them over the course of the season. Those quizzes don\u2019t account for a large total of his grade, but Zimmerman said that his teammates advise taking any easy class that can balance out the workload in the fall semester.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to play football\u2026you need to take classes you can afford to miss,\u201d he said. \nBus rides and wedding tents\nThere are Division III schools that have well-funded facilities. Salisbury\u2019s Seagull Stadium cost $21 million and CUA recently opened a new weight room.\nBut there are some schools that don\u2019t have new facilities like locker rooms for visiting teams. Johnson recalled a situation in his sophomore season when the team had to dress in a wedding tent and had to walk to a high school to take a shower after the game.\nNow in his senior year at Salisbury, Johnson said he got used to those conditions eventually.\n\u201cAfter the first year or so it doesn\u2019t really bother you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tend to like it.\u201d\nSalisbury University offensive lineman Isaac Johnson (38) makes a move against an opposing lineman and closes in for a sack. (Photo courtesy of Joey Gardner/ FotoJoe)\nMost Division III schools don\u2019t have the budget to allow teams to fly to every game, which means they take buses.\nMany schools play in a localized conference, meaning they rarely have to travel long distances. As a member of the Capital Athletic Conference, Salisbury plays teams in Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nBut sometimes schools have to make longer treks for games. For example, CUA traveled 15 hours to play a game against Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine, in 2017.\n\u201cWe started driving that Thursday, made it halfway, then drove the rest of the way on Friday,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThen we drove the whole 15 hours back after the game. I think we got back around 5:30 the following morning.\u201d CUA won the season finale 33-14.\nThe trick to making such a long ride depends on getting as comfortable as possible, Zimmerman said, but he added that it doesn\u2019t have too much of an impact on performance.\nThe other aspects of Division III football that aren\u2019t as flashy as Division I don\u2019t seem to bother the players, either. They may not get as much national television exposure or looks from NFL scouts, but most of them are just happy to play the sport they love and thankful for the coaches who gave them a chance.\n\u201cI still love this program even though we don\u2019t have all the things they get in Division I,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt teaches me what the true sport of football is. I never thought I would be who I am today.\u201d",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan believes University of Maryland head coach DJ Durkin, athletic director Damon Evans and president Wallace Loh will be fired for mishandling an abusive culture that resulted in Jordan McNair\u2019s death by heatstroke.\n Brennan said she feels the removal of the three individuals seems likely based on her experience covering similar incidents. She was part of a panel Wednesday organized by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism that discussed media coverage in the aftermath of the McNair tragedy.\n\u201cI just think this is so bad,\u201d Brennan said of the situation. \u201cI think Maryland is better than this.\u201d\nThe communications office for Loh had no comment on Brennan\u2019s remarks. The Maryland athletics department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMcNair\u2019s death and the coverage surrounding it has resulted in a dissection of the culture of Maryland\u2019s football program. The aftermath included the resignation of strength coach Rick Court; the placement of Durkin and two athletic trainers on administrative leave; and two investigations, one of which is ongoing.\nMcNair, a sophomore football player, was hospitalized on May 29 after collapsing during a summer practice and died June 13. More than a month later, it was confirmed by multiple reports that McNair died of heatstroke.\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan, sports editor of Maryland\u2019s campus newspaper, The Diamondback, told the panel the university\u2019s missteps in caring for McNair had been clear since late July.\n\u201cThe fact is if someone dies of heatstroke, they weren\u2019t properly treated,\u201d Crabtree-Hannigan said.\nResults of an independent investigation presented to the University System of Maryland Board of Regents showed that McNair did not receive proper care after collapsing on the field. The university medical staff wrapped McNair in cold towels instead of giving him cold water immersion therapy, which is a common treatment for heatstroke.\nIt took 34 minutes before McNair was removed from the field and was placed in an ambulance 1 hour and 39 minutes after he began to suffer seizures. \nOn Aug. 10, ESPN released article by Heather Dinich detailing what she called a toxic culture under Durkin and spearheaded by Court. The report described a culture based on \u201cfear and intimidation\u201d with verbal abuse and the endorsement of bad eating habits. \nDurkin was placed on administrative leave the following day. Two days later, Court announced his resignation.\nBrennan said the ESPN report hit \u201clike a ton of bricks.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the nation said, \u2018woah, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen it became a national story. You know when you get calls from CNN Headline News that this has left sports and gone into the culture in a big way.\u201d\nWhen Dave Ziren, sports editor for The Nation and also on the Povich panel, first heard of McNair\u2019s death, he said he speculated whether there were any signs of a toxic culture that could have prevented the tragedy.\n\u201cI wondered if there had been letters sent, emails sent to say\u2026there is something with the culture of the way practices are happening here,\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered if there would be that tragic correlation.\u201d\nBut according to Crabtree-Hannigan, the signs were there. He recalled Durkin bragging during press conferences that practices were held when it was hot because the head coach wanted his players to be prepared to play in the heat.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking that way and using cavalier language (the coaching staff) was using about changing the culture\u2026it\u2019s rather damaging,\u201d Crabtree-Hannigan said. \nAnd according to a Sept. 30 Washington Post story, there was also an unsigned letter hand-delivered to Loh in December of 2016 that was written to warn the university president of a \u201ccalamitous and abusive behavior in the football program.\u201d\nLoh denied hearing of any abuse at Maryland before the ESPN report was released.\nLoh also denied a proposal one year before McNair\u2019s death that would have altered the medical care for athletes at the university, according to an article published by The Washington Post in August. The plan would require athletic trainers to attend the university\u2019s school of medicine in Baltimore and to be independent from the athletic department.\nBecause of the negligence from the university and abuse from the football program, Brennan believes there will a complete change of leadership at the university.\n\u201cMy sense is that they will all be gone,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cJust from covering a lot of these things over the years and not being born yesterday, this is what this looks like.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order Tuesday forming an Office of Education Accountability, an independently appointed investigator general, to look into allegations of corruption, abuse and other improprieties in the public education systems across the state.\nThe governor\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of several high-profile scandals in Maryland school systems.\nIn Prince George\u2019s County, school board members last year accused county school system leadership of artificially inflating graduation rates by altering students\u2019 grades, and in March cited unapproved pay raises for some school system staff.\nHogan highlighted former Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Dallas Dance\u2019s recent jail sentence after he pleaded guilty in March to perjury as an example of the need for more oversight. Dance failed to disclose income he received from a company that he helped to obtain a no-bid contract with the school system.\n\u201cAfter repeated allegations of wrongdoing, mismanagement and corruption, citizens have lost confidence in the leadership of their local school systems,\u201d Hogan said at a State House news conference. \u201cOur children cannot and should not have to wait until the Legislature returns in January,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThey deserve action beginning right now.\u201d\nThe newly formed office \u201cwill act as a liaison between local boards of education, the state Board of Education and Maryland\u2019s concerned citizens,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThis new unit will be responsible for analyzing, coordinating and providing recommendations on matters including procurement improprieties, abuse, neglect, safety, grade fixing, graduation requirements, assessments, educational facilities and budgetary issues.\u201d\nA bill Hogan, a Republican running for re-election, spearheaded earlier this year to establish an investigative oversight office for schools failed in the Democrat-controlled Legislature.\nThe governor\u2019s executive order will be followed by the introduction of the Accountability in Education Act of 2019 to the General Assembly after the legislative session begins Jan. 9, Hogan said. The act would establish the Office of State Education Investigator General, an independent part of the Maryland State Department of Education, and would be appointed by Hogan, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., D-Prince George\u2019s, Charles and Calvert and House Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel.\n\u201cThis new office will be charged with investigating complaints of unethical, unprofessional, improper or illegal conduct in our schools,\u201d Hogan said, and \u201cwill be able to make inquiries, have the ability to obtain information by subpoena and hold hearings in order to get to the truth.\u201d\nJohn Woolums, the director of governmental relations for the Maryland Association of Boards of Education, said his office has previously opposed similar legislation to create a statewide inspector general, and their position would not change with the governor\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not reflective of any reluctance to be subject to accountability but in fact it\u2019s because there is ample authority residing with the state\u2019s superintendent of schools and the state Board of Education to provide oversight and enforce state laws and regulations that they determine are not being followed or adhered to by local school systems,\u201d Woolums said. \u201cThere have been bills in the past introduced to create an inspector general and we\u2019ve traditionally and consistently opposed those.\u201d\nHogan appointed Valerie Radomsky to be the director of the newly formed office. Radomsky, a former Baltimore County school teacher, is a Board of Public Works coordinator in the Maryland comptroller\u2019s office.\nThe new office would be responsible for responding to complaints and referring them to the State Board of Education or other public school agencies. The complaints, and their resolutions, would be maintained in a database, Hogan said. An annual report of the findings and recommendations would be submitted to the General Assembly, he added.\nHogan\u2019s gubernatorial opponent, Democratic candidate Ben Jealous, criticized Hogan\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cA political investigator run out of the governor\u2019s office won\u2019t change the fact that our schools are underfunded by billions of dollars and our teachers are underpaid. As governor, I will fully fund our schools, not blame our hardworking teachers and support staff.\u201d\nHogan maintains he has spent record amounts of money on education in Maryland, in excess of the Legislature\u2019s mandated funding formulas.\nJealous announced a piece of his own education agenda Tuesday, promising the creation of a Teacher School Supply Fund. The money would come from other Marylanders choosing to donate a portion of their tax returns.\nMaryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost voiced her disappointment at Hogan\u2019s decision to sign the executive order.\n\u201cOn what should be an exciting first day (of school), to hear Gov. Hogan highlight failures when he, for the past three years has underfunded our schools\u2026\u201d Bost said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s office already has agencies available to look into claims of fraud. This is a diversion of resources, and campaign rhetoric.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 A bill that aims to ensure young, undocumented Maryland students referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d can pursue higher education by giving qualified individuals access to in-state tuition is advancing in the Maryland General Assembly.\nThe circumstances under which Dreamers and residents with temporary protective status are exempt from paying the out-of-state tuition rate at public institutions of higher education will be altered under House bill 1536, which is cross-filed as Senate bill 546.\nUnder the legislation, qualified students would soon be able to pay the in-state tuition rate at any Maryland public higher education institution or the in-county rate at any community college, regardless of whether they live in that county.\nThe current state Dream Act, passed in 2012, says that an individual who attended a Maryland high school for at least three years and graduated or received the equivalent of a high school diploma pays the same tuition rates that resident students pay. \nCurrent law also states that students are required to begin at a Maryland community college in the same district as the high school they graduated from. Once the student completes 60 credits, they may enroll at a public four-year institution and pay in-state tuition. \nThe new bill removes the credit requirement and would allow students to directly enter any public state college or university, and extends the period of eligibility from four to six years after graduating from high school. It would go into effect on July 1.\n\u201cCountless students who qualify (for in-state tuition) are more than ready to begin higher education at a four-year university right away. This bill will allow these Dreamers to continue their academic career at the college of their choice,\u201d said sponsor Delegate Sheila Hixson, D-Montgomery, in a statement to Capital News Service. \nHigh school senior and advocate for CASA, an immigrants-rights advocacy group, Jesus Vicu\u00f1a, 18, one of the 9,700 Dreamers under protective status in the state, worries that his time will run out before he is able to pursue his dream of running track at Coppin State University, which just sent him an acceptance letter.\n\u201cI started to feel a sense of stability, I no longer had to live in the shadows. \u2026 For the first time I started to picture myself at a university and I finally had the opportunity to make my parents\u2019 sacrifices worth it,\u201d said Vicu\u00f1a, who lives in Baltimore and attends Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, a public high school, about receiving DACA at the age of 15 after immigrating from Mexico with his family at 9 months old. \nHis DACA waiver runs out in April 2019, he said. \nVicu\u00f1a got involved in CASA and his high school\u2019s Hispanic club to promote legislation that helps students like him and testified in front of the Maryland House Ways and Means committee in favor of House bill 1536. \n\u201cThis is a big step towards progress because everything is so unsure at the federal level,\u201d he said. \nThe Trump administration announced Sep. 5 it was phasing out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and gave Congress six months to figure out a solution. It was further delayed by rulings from federal judges in California and New York, who both ordered the Trump administration to resume processing DACA renewal applications.\nWhile the deadline has passed without a fix from Congress, the case is still going through the federal appeals process, leaving DACA recipients in limbo. \nA recent Supreme Court ruling has given DACA participants a reprieve. \nThe University System of Maryland is monitoring this legislation and will continue to welcome qualified students as they have since the Dream Act was enacted, according to a representative for the University System.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 The majority of jurisdictions in the state set aside fewer than 90 minutes per week for physical education.\nBut for the past eight years, legislation introduced to require a higher physical activity and education standard in the state has still not seen progress. \nThe sponsor of the legislation, Delegate Jay Walker D-Prince George\u2019s, called it \u201ca bill that we\u2019ve seen too many times over the years.\u201d\nThe proposal requires all public elementary schools to set aside a maximum of 150 minutes per week for physical activity, including a minimum of 90 minutes per week for physical education.\nFor required minutes not spent in physical education, elementary schools would have to designate a physical activity leadership team to plan and coordinate extra opportunities for activity, the bill states.\nThe biggest issue remains what the school districts would cut from their academic curriculums to provide more time for physical activity. \nWalker said he \u201ctalked to people that work with Boards of Education in the state (who) said if it\u2019s mandated they would find a way to make it work.\u201d \nDuring the bill\u2019s hearing on Feb. 8, Delegate Carolyn Howard D-Prince George\u2019s, asked how to incorporate more physical education.\n\u201cThe question has always been, what do you remove or delete in teaching in schools so that we can get the 90 minutes?\u201d asked Howard.\nNewport Mill Middle School physical education teachers Matt Slatkin and Shannon Spencer have supported this legislation \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d because, they told Capital News Service, lack of elementary school physical education affects students when they attend middle school. \nSlatkin told the Capital News Service that Montgomery County Public Schools, where Newport Mill is located, \u201cskirt\u201d around the term physical activity by counting physical education with recess. \nWhile the county includes the 30 minutes a day for physical activity during recess, students may not even move at all, Slatkin said. He added that recess is often held indoors during the winter and in times of bad weather. \nSlatkin said physical education is taught by a professional teacher, whereas recess does not require a curriculum or standards, and does not teach anything. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t try to compare recess to physical education,\u201d said Slatkin. \nAccording to the Maryland State Department of Education, as of January 2018, Montgomery County has the lowest minimum amount of required physical education per week at 30 minutes, followed by Prince George\u2019s with 40 minutes per week. \nAccording to a state analysis, 18 of the state\u2019s 24 jurisdictions do not meet the 90-minute standard under the bill; at least four of those would need to hire additional staff \u2014 at a total cost of $13.7 million \u2014 to meet that requirement if the legislation passes. \nThis includes $1.1 million for Allegany, $1.2 million for Cecil, $10.9 million for Montgomery, and $542,000 for Queen Anne\u2019s; these amounts are expected to increase marginally over the following few years, according to the state analysis. Allegany would need 14 teachers, Cecil would need 17, Montgomery would need 133 and Queen Anne\u2019s would need eight to meet the bill requirements, according to the fiscal analysis.\nThe other 14 jurisdictions that don\u2019t require at least 90 minutes may also need an increase in funds to meet the standard, but they have not been assessed in the fiscal analysis.\nThe remaining 10 jurisdictions would not need additional funding because they already meet the proposed standards.\nThe bill would take effect on Oct. 1, but a local school system may apply for an extension until July 1, 2021 to ensure compliance. \nThe federal No Child Left Behind Act in 2002 altered allotted time for certain school activities, according to the state fiscal analysis.\nFollowing the No Child Left Behind Act, a national study on curriculum by the Center on Education Policy found that schools prioritized time on tested subjects, including math and language arts, and spent less time on other subjects and activities, including lunch, physical education and recess. \nWalker said during committee testimony on Feb. 8 that the bill\u2019s cost has decreased over the years and that \u201cit is possible to implement this program.\u201d\nPatricia Swanson, legislative aide for Montgomery County Public Schools Board of Education, told Capital News Service the board opposed this legislation because it is a large unfunded mandate and does not believe this issue should be decided at a state level. \nSwanson also said \u201cMCPS has taken action to clarify physical education time with schools beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, and is taking steps to gather information directly from each school on current schedules and class time.\u201d\nIn the 2018 to 2019 school year grades K-5 will be required a minimum of 45 minutes of physical education per week, she said.\nChildren between 5 and 12 years old should get at least an hour per day of physical activity, according to The National Association for Sport and Physical Education. The activity should be intermittent and a mix of moderate and vigorous exercise, the association said.\nWhile the bill is not expected to progress in the legislative session, Slatkin told the Capital News Service that he believes that as the public\u2019s knowledge grows, so will support for the bill. \n\u201cNobody knew about this bill the past eight years and now it\u2019s finally getting out,\u201d said Slatkin. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the parents want, the students want, and the teachers want.\u201d",

    "content": "THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED*\nANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Prompted by alleged grade-fixing in Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools and perjury and theft allegations in the Baltimore area, a pair of bills in the General Assembly would establish investigative offices to oversee schools in Maryland. \nRepublican Gov. Larry Hogan and a Democratic lawmaker each are attempting to get their own education accountability bills passed this year. \nThe bills come after state Department of Education officials hired a Washington-based firm, Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services, to audit graduation rates in the Prince George\u2019s County public school system, following a letter that several school board members wrote to Hogan citing \u201cwidespread systemic corruption.\u201d\nThe audit used sample groups taken from the 2016 and 2017 graduating classes and found that, on average, nearly 5 percent of the students had been ineligible to graduate. An additional 24.5 percent, on average, were lacking documentation to verify that they were qualified to graduate. \nBecause it was based on a sample, the audit report did not identify system-wide fraud in the Prince George\u2019s County school system. \nBaltimore County Superintendent Dallas Dance was indicted earlier this year on four counts of perjury following an investigation that concluded he failed to disclose almost $147,000 from private consulting firms. His successor, Verletta White, was also reported to have failed to disclose money earned from private firms. \nFormer Baltimore Community High School principal Leslie Lewis pleaded guilty to stealing more than $58,000 from the school. \nHogan\u2019s response was the introduction of the Accountability in Education Act of 2018 (Senate bill 302 and House bill 355) to create an independent unit, the Office of the State Education Investigator General, within the Maryland State Department of Education. \n\u201cThis lack of accountability in education systems all across our state cannot and will not be tolerated by our administration,\u201d said Hogan in a statement. \u201cNot addressing it would mean that we are failing Maryland taxpayers, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 failing our children who need help the most.\u201d\nUnder Hogan\u2019s plan, the Investigator General, as a part of an Education Monitoring Unit, would be charged with investigating complaints of unethical conduct in Maryland public schools. \nA representative of the state teachers\u2019 union said he is concerned that the majority of the members \u2014 five \u2014 are appointed by the governor with the other four \u2014 two each \u2014 by the Senate president and speaker of the House. This group then evaluates candidates and makes a recommendation to the governor for a new Investigator General.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the answer is to politicize the schools,\u201d said Steven Hershkowitz, press secretary for the Maryland State Education Association. \nAnother bill, sponsored by Delegate Alonzo T. Washington, D-Prince George\u2019s, puts power in local hands by authorizing county commissioners or the city or county to establish an Office of the Investigator General in a local school system. These local offices would be able to conduct their own investigations without the need for state involvement under this legislation, House bill 1492. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary to have a statewide inspector,\u201d Washington told Capital News Service Tuesday. \u201cOur local jurisdictions can handle this issue.\u201d \nThrough a third bill, House bill 184, Washington is also working to establish an Inspector General solely in Prince George\u2019s County. \n*Story has been udpated with the following changes: In a paragraph quoting a Maryland State Education Association spokesman, the quote has been shortened. The preceding two paragraphs are new and include clarifying information. The two paragraphs preceding those have been moved.",

The recommendations aim to prepare Maryland students for future challenges and will be implemented over 10 years with small grants to assess their effectiveness.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Legislation that would expand funding for pre-kindergarten and special education and encourage students to become teachers topped the list of priorities a state panel announced on Thursday.\nThe legislation, House bill 1415 and Senate bill 1092, also would create an early-literacy initiative and other resources for students living in poverty, and promote career and technical education. \nFormed in 2016 by the General Assembly, the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education is often referred to as the \u201cKirwin Commission\u201d after its chair, William English \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, former president of the University of Maryland and chancellor of the University System of Maryland.\nThe commission brings together representatives from across the state to review the findings from past educational aid formulas and hear from national experts on world class school systems to address education policy issues Maryland is facing. \nAlong with the new bills, the commission has proposed: creating a way for teachers to earn more; providing free or low-cost pre-kindergarten to every 4-year-old in the state; giving more resources to at-risk students; and reinstating vocational training in many high schools, according to the preliminary report it released Thursday.\nThe goal is to prepare Maryland students \u201cto meet the challenges of a changing global economy, to meet the State\u2019s workforce needs, to be prepared for postsecondary education\u00a0and the workforce, and to be successful citizens in the 21st century.\u201d \nDelegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore, told Capital News Service the recommendations would be \u201ca great first tiny step\u201d toward looking at areas in need of reform.\nThe recommendations would be implemented in small grants\u2014likely over the span of 10 years or so\u2014and allow students to be tracked so the benefits can be assessed later, said McIntosh, who sits on the commission. \nThe Kirwan Commission, tasked with focusing on education funding, was told by a consultant that state and local governments need to increase education funding by about $3 billion, in addition to the approximately $6.5 billion the state spends now. \n\u201cThe budget this year is going to meet the requirements for an outdated funding formula, created in the early 2000s, which never anticipated students coming from poverty or speaking English as a second language,\u201d Steven Hershkowitz, press secretary for the Maryland State Education Association said last week.\n\u201cAs enrollment climbs our schools don\u2019t have the resources they need to stay on top,\u201d Hershkowitz said. \u201cThere was $2.9 billion found to be underfunded (by the commission), the schools need it desperately.\u201d \nGov. Larry Hogan, R, recently criticized the commission for the time it took to put together the report, saying that he might need to \u201csend out a search party.\u201d \nDelegate Adrienne A. Jones responded to the comments during a press conference Thursday saying she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Hogan\u2019s words. \nThis year\u2019s package of legislation is a \u201cprecursor of a bill coming next year,\u201d according to Kirwan; a final report of the commission\u2019s findings is scheduled to be issued later this year.\n\u2013CNS Correspondent Sean Whooley contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Maryland's juvenile justice agency proposes shifting school hours to later in the day to reduce unsupervised time for teenagers and curb juvenile crime, which spikes from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 A significant spike in juvenile crime from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on school days has led to a push by the state\u2019s juvenile justice agency to shift school start and finish times.\nThe department is advocating for a later opening and release to limit the amount of time kids spend unsupervised in the evening. The thinking goes, the more time teenagers are congregated in one spot, the greater chance of delinquency.\n\u201cIf you think about it, especially in environments that are urban, you usually have a large number of teenagers getting released from school at the same time,\u201d said Jay Cleary, chief of staff to Sam Abed, the secretary of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. \u201cEverybody is in one place, at one time. It just tends to be sort of a natural result.\u201d\nThe proposal got some positive responses among members of a House committee last month.\nDelegate Curt Anderson, D-Baltimore, told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service that he is enthusiastic about the start-time idea. He said he had previously supported longer days on an academic basis, though the department\u2019s proposal is to simply shift hours, ideally 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., not to extend the day.\n\u201cIf (later or longer hours is) also talked about in relationship to public safety, I think that gives it another push,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cMr. Abed talking about it in terms of the juvenile system, I think, was very timely.\u201d Abed presented his findings to the House Judiciary Committee on Jan 17.\nAccording to 2014 data from the U.S. Justice Department, roughly 19 percent of juvenile violent crime \u2013 which includes murder, sexual assault, simple assault, robbery and aggravated assault \u2013 happens during the hours of 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\nFifteen percent occurs during the standard juvenile curfew hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. But because \u201ccurfew\u201d times are 8 hours long, every day of the year, the rate of crime during the four after-school hours is much higher, the report found.\nAnd even though the number of school days and non-school days in a year are essentially the same, 63 percent of violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days, the Justice Department reported.\nIn Baltimore City, the vast majority of middle and high schools release at 3:30 p.m. or later. City Neighbors High lets out the latest, at 4 p.m. and starts at 9 a.m.\nAmy Krulak, a special educator at City Neighbors High School, said the later hours have benefited students from an academic standpoint \u2013 they are more alert at 9 a.m. \u2013 but isn\u2019t convinced that a later release would affect public safety.\nIt\u2019s a nice idea, she said, but students would still, at some point, be together at a bus stop.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re getting out (together) at the same time, just later, I don\u2019t know if that solves anything,\u201d Krulak said.\nKrulak also said it wouldn\u2019t be ideal for students to walk home in the dark. The key to improving conduct in her view is for the school to \u201ccreate a healthy environment\u201d during regular hours.\nThe department of Juvenile Justice Services doesn\u2019t see a downside.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to completely eliminate young people getting into trouble at those times,\u201d Cleary said. \u201cBut the spike is fairly large as it is right now (at the) 3 or 4 o\u2019clock timeframe. If you\u2019re able to push that out a little further, it can only help.\u201d\nThe Baltimore City School Board said in an email to Capital News Service in January that it doesn\u2019t have any thoughts or ideas regarding the secretary\u2019s recommendation.\nThe bulk of Abed\u2019s presentation was aimed to show the department\u2019s progress in providing services and refining its methods, from addressing racial inequity to connecting released youth to community service.\nDelegate David Moon, D-Montgomery, said he came away from the briefing particularly interested in the school-start time idea.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIf you believe the data (from Secretary Abed\u2019s presentation), basically this is an issue about after-school supervision, to the extent that kids are getting out at 3 o\u2019clock and then committing violent crimes until dinner time.\u201d\nMoon noted, however, that it\u2019s precisely these types of specifics that show that more information is necessary in all facets of juvenile services to form legislation and pass effective solutions.\n\u201cThe more data you have \u2013 and you can tease out little items like that \u2013 it might give you pause, to say \u2018Okay, maybe the solution isn\u2019t so simple as let\u2019s add 10 years to someone\u2019s jail sentence,\u2019\u201d Moon said. \u201cIf there are other factors in play, I\u2019d like to see us take a more evidence-based approach.\u201d\n\u201330\u2013",

The bill aims to remove barriers to adoption and higher education by extending the eligibility period from 5 to 10 years.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS,Maryland \u2014 Verging on adulthood, Shalita O\u2019Neale faced a big decision: college or family?\n\u201cI had a family member who wanted to adopt me but they felt it would be best if I stayed in the foster care system because of the gift of post-secondary education,\u201d O\u2019Neale told a panel of Maryland lawmakers last week. \n\u201cThis was a barrier for adoption for me\u2026I did stay in foster care and I aged out at age 21,\u201dsaid O\u2019Neale, foster youth ombudsman for the Department of Human Services. \nMaryland legislators want to make that decision easier with a proposed expansion of tuition grants to help more teens who have gone through the foster care system get a higher education.\nThis bill would extend free in-state tuition for public institutions to students who were 13 or older in foster care for at least a year, but later reunited with their parents or adopted.\nSenate bill 85, requested by the Department of Human Services and approved by the Maryland Senate on Tuesday, also extended the time frame for foster youth to obtain their degrees from 5 to 10 years. \nThe bill is expected to go through the House of Delegates, which would have to approve it before it would become law.\nCurrent law requires an individual placed in foster care after age 13 to stay in out-of-home care though their high school graduation, GED completion or their 18th birthday in order to keep their college tuition-free. If they are adopted or placed into other guardianship, they lose their eligibility. \nThis discourages \u201colder foster youth to achieve permanency, if it means they will not be afforded the same privilege of attending college \u2014 tuition free,\u201d said the Advocates for Children and Youth, a charity based in Silver Spring, Maryland, in testimony presented to the committee. \u00a0\nCollege hopeful \u201cCameron,\u201d \u2014 a pseudonym to ensure confidentiality \u2014 was placed in foster care after age 13 due to his parents\u2019 substance abuse and domestic violence, according to Erica LeMon, Director of Advocacy for Children and Families at Maryland Legal Aid. \nHis father attended counseling and substance abuse treatment to become a suitable parent for Cameron, allowing the two to reunite over a year later, said LeMon. \n\u201cThis (new) measure would make Cameron eligible for the waiver and enable him to access a college education which otherwise may be out of reach,\u201d LeMon told the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee. \nA study done by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 84 percent of 17- and 18-year-old foster youths report wanting to go to college, but only 20 percent of those who graduate high school attend college, and only between 2 percent and 9 percent actually earn their bachelor\u2019s degree. \nOnly 26 percent of youth in foster care who attend a 4-year college or university will obtain their degree in 6 years, the study found. Almost 57 percent of students who enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities in the fall of 2011 completed school within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse, an education non-profit.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have an adopted family,\u201d O\u2019Neale said. Instead, she went to college. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked to have both.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's Juvenile Services Education System faces ongoing challenges in providing quality education comparable to state schools, with issues identified by an independent monitoring unit. Despite a structured program aligned with state standards and the potential for reducing recidivism, individualized educational needs of students pose significant barriers.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Various systematic issues within the Maryland\u2019s Juvenile Services Education System have consistently interfered with students receiving instruction at the same quality as that available to pupils in state schools, according to quarterly reports from an independent monitoring unit. \nThe Juvenile Services Education System, more commonly referred to as JSES, was established in 2004 by the state Legislature in effort to provide a comprehensive education program for children within the state\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services. \nUnder the supervision of the state\u2019s Department of Education, all offenders are required to have six hours of education daily, with lesson plans stemming from the state\u2019s College and Career Readiness Standards, including core courses like language arts, mathematics and sciences. \nInmates who participate in correctional education programs are 43 percent less likely to return to prison than those who did not, according to a study released in 2013 from the RAND Corp., a research organization in California. \nA more individualized structure within Maryland\u2019s juvenile detention and placement centers could be beneficial to the education system, the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit housed in the Office of the Maryland Attorney General found.  \n\u201cWe conduct unannounced visits, but we tend to prioritize facilities that we think are struggling,\u201d Nick Moroney, the director of the monitoring unit, said. \u201cKids are coming in off the street and they have different needs educationally.\u201d\nThe Juvenile Services Education System is a year-round program, unlike a traditional public school that is open for around 10 months with vacation time. Average time for a youth within a detention center is about 30 days, but can vary from a few weeks to six months, according to the Department of Juvenile Services. \nIn FY 2016, the number of youths in detention before conviction was 2,033, while the number of youths awaiting placement in a treatment facility was 742. \nThe three most common offenses for children in detention are second-degree assault, robbery, and burglary, and the age of youths average between 14 and 19 years old, with more than 70 percent between 15 and 17, according to the Department of Juvenile Services. \nAll detention facilities within the Juvenile Services Education System are organized by living unit, which is based on individuals\u2019 charges and the relationships the youths have with one another, rather than by grade level, according to the monitoring unit.  \nGrace Reusing, an assistant public defender within the Public Defender\u2019s Office, has been filing complaints on behalf of families in the Juvenile Services Education System since 2014, all of which state that practices within the program, including failure to provide Individualized Education Programs for those with special education needs, are in violation of federal law. \nWhen a violation is found, the administrative staff of the Juvenile Services Education System is required to address the complaint and document the reparations, according to Deborah Grinnage-Pulley, executive director of the system. \nIn one-and-a-half-hour classes, with about 12 students per classroom, teachers are expected to teach curriculum that fits the needs of each student, regardless of the skill level of each individual. \nIvor Mitchell, the former principal of the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, one of the 13 facilities, served as an employee of the Juvenile Services Education System from July 2015 to July 2017 and was the third administrator at the Baltimore center in four years. He quit his position, he said, because he constantly found himself disappointed with how the system was run.   \n\u201cThey take curriculum from the public school system, and therefore is based on a 10-month scale,\u201d Mitchell explained. \u201cThere are things like spelling bees and math competitions, which is okay, but it really is academic babysitting versus giving them a chance to gain traction.\u201d \nAnother issue accounted for in the monitoring unit\u2019s reports is retaining the teachers, who are hired by the state Department of Education.  \nThe areas in which there are difficulties finding certified teachers include technology education, special education and math, according to Sylvia Lawson, deputy state superintendent for school effectiveness and chief performance officer. \n\u201cOne reason for the issue of (staff) retention is that the surrounding school systems just pay better in the metro area where many of the facilities are located,\u201d Margi Joshi, a monitor of several facilities, said. \nThe state\u2019s Department of Education, with help from the Office of Human Resources, offers a sign on bonus and retention bonus as incentives to hire certified teachers who will continue employment with the Juvenile Services Education System, according to a written response from the Department of Education to a monitoring unit report. The response also states that administrators of the Juvenile Services Education System have recently hired a human resources liaison who is dedicated solely to finding staff for the program. \nMoroney also explained that teachers and principals who work for the Juvenile Services Education System see working year-round as a major issue in terms of their wanting to stay in the system. \nFunding for the program comes from three places: $16,602,385 from the state, making up 83.1 percent of total funding, $1,013,311 from the federal government, with 5.1 percent of total funding and $2,365,221 from local system reimbursement, contributing 11.8 percent of total funding, according to the state\u2019s Department of Education. \nMaryland state Sen. Dolores Kelley, D-Baltimore County, has advocated for an increase in funding for JSES programming in order to attract and retain teachers and other staff.\n\u201cI was really trying to get them to agree to a bill that didn\u2019t get anywhere because I was asking for comparable pay and standards,\u201d Kelley told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \u201cMany things that are very basic that any public school would be taken to the woodshed for not doing, haven\u2019t been done. The vision is just not there on part of the department.\u201d \nThe Maryland Department of Budget and Management determines salary based on a variety of factors, including years of service and regional location of the school, according to the state Department of Education. While annual wages can be similar for teachers in the Juvenile Services Education System and teachers in local public schools, educators who work in the Department of Juvenile Services\u2019 facilities do not get summers off. \nAll facilities are equipped with computer labs, smart boards and iPads for student use, but there are several factors that prohibit the children from benefiting from technology, according to Kelley and agency monitors.  \n\u201cOur observation on that is that technology is not consistently available to kids and teachers in MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) JSES (Juvenile Services Education System) schools,\u201d Moroney told Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service in an email. \u201cStuff breaks and takes forever to get fixed.\u201d \nThe state\u2019s Department of Education provides professional development to teachers on the most effective ways to integrate technology into their daily lessons, according to Grinnage-Pulley. \n\u201cThe kids are very aware of the fact that one really promising way to get back on track is school, they very much understand that,\u201d Eliza Steele, one of the monitors from the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit, explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re stuck in a system that doesn\u2019t represent a fair opportunity to get out of it.\u201d \nMitchell, as well as the team of monitors, explained that many educators and principals will have ideas for how to introduce programs that they feel will be meaningful for the kids, but they\u2019ll be shot down by the administration for not following the current system. \n\u201cAdhering to (the Maryland College and Career Ready Standards) is critical to the future success of those students,\u201d Grinnage-Pulley told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service in an email. \u201cThere is plenty of room for teacher creativity within the parameters set forth.\u201d\nGrinnage-Pulley noted that following the standards set in place, which are used by Maryland public schools, are designed to make certain students who return to school do not fall behind. \nAccording to a 2012 study from the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, 66 percent of youth do not return to school after they are released from juvenile services facilities. \n\u201cYou come in thinking that you are going to be a change agent and what you quickly realize is that what they want you to do is be a soldier and implement bureaucratic strategies that you know don\u2019t work,\u201d Mitchell stated. \nCheltenham Youth Detention Center, which was renovated and reopened on Nov. 16, 2016, prides itself on having a computer lab, smart boards in every classroom and elective courses, such as pottery, available in its education hall. \nThe facility is in Prince George\u2019s County and has the capacity to fit 72 male inmates; as of Nov. 17 this year, 42 boys were housed in the facility.\nThe principal of Cheltenham, Michael Dodson, requires his teachers to submit a semester schedule, as well as weekly lesson plans to ensure teachers from the state Department of Education and employees from Maryland\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services are on the same page. \nAs of last month, there were 11 teachers \u2014 six dedicated to core courses, four for classes geared toward special education and one resource teacher \u2014 who work at the facility. \nWhen Dodson arrived in July, he made an effort to transform the designated classrooms into real workspaces by asking the teachers to decorate the white, cinder block walls with things that would typically sit in a public school classroom. The math classroom is filled with colorful posters, while the social studies room has a map on the back wall. \n\u201cThe atmosphere is very important because if a classroom looks like the schools these kids used to go to, they\u2019ll be more engaged and willing to learn,\u201d Dodson explained. \u201cOur kids have great relationships with their teachers, and the ones who have been here longer are very protective of their teachers.\u201d \nHe also requires teachers to incorporate technology \u2014 either the computer lab or iPads \u2014 at least once a week. Programs such as office skills management and career research development are also offered for the young men at the facility. \nWhile Dodson is having success at Cheltenham, the system in its entirety is not promoting the best solution for children in the juvenile justice system, according to the monitoring unit. \n\u201cIt seems to us it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep doing the same thing and seeing the same result,\u201d Moroney said. \u201cMSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) itself really needs to advocate in a much better way for the JSES (Juvenile Services Education System) to be properly resourced.\u201d \nThe state should evaluate the feasibility of the Department of Education Juvenile Services Education System continuing to maintain responsibility for education services within the facilities, monitors wrote in their most recent report.  \nMoroney told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service that he suggests some laws and regulations be revisited, or that pilot programs and charter schools could be the better route for these children. \n\u201cIt should be the most direct, high-impact program because you have an audience that is captive until their release for a lack of a better word \u2014 they want to learn,\u201d Ivor said. \u201cTheir back is against the wall, life has moved on without them and they know it. They want an opportunity not just to learn but to progress their educational futures.\u201d",

School officials told Capital News Service that they\u2019re waiting on funds from the state and a Native American group to make the change, along with other necessary alterations in the school district.\n\n\nReturn to \u201cMore than a Mascot\u201d: a Capital News Service examination of Redskins high schools\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re frustrated,\u201d said Michael Ostrander, principal of Belding High School. \u201cWe made a commitment to our community that we were not going to spend any general funds on this change, and we haven\u2019t. But we are really hopeful that that group will come through in the way that they said they would.\u201d\nAt some of the 13 high schools that have dropped the name over the last four years, the moniker and Native American imagery lingers on uniforms, gym floors and in hallways, forcing schools to find the funds to make changes. \u00a0\n\nAt Port Townsend High School in Washington, a donation from a local Native American tribe helped the school transition to the Redhawks.\nA state law that mandated four California schools drop the name also made it possible for the state to reimburse the schools for any necessary changes. \nAt Lamar High School in Houston, Texas, the school district covered the cost of making the switch. \n\nBelding officially dropped the name in December 2016. \u00a0But it began phasing out the term a decade prior in a conscious effort to separate the school from what some consider a racially insensitive mascot. \nWhen it replaced athletic uniforms, it replaced a Native American logo with the letter \u201cB.\u201d And when they renovated parts of the building, they no longer used the name on school structures.\nIn March 2016, a group of parents voiced concern over a T-shirt with a Native American headdress and a skull worn by students at a school wrestling match. They asked the administration to either embrace the current name or select a new one, kicking off a nine-month community dialogue. \n\u201cA group of parents approached the school board and their concern was we either need to use it on uniforms, use it all over the place or move on and have a different mascot,\u201d Ostrander said.\n\nAfter dropping the name, the public chose the Black Knights as its new mascot in March 2017.\nIn addition to re-engraving two granite fixtures, the school district still needs to replace several athletic and band uniforms, as well as some permanent signage throughout the district. The entire district \u2014 which includes two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school \u2014 used the mascot in some manner. \nAccording to Belding Area Schools Superintendent Brent Noskey, Belding needs between $150,000 and $175,000 to make required changes at the schools. They hope to pay for it using a pool of state funds set aside by the state and a Michigan-based Native American group.\n\u201cI have said we are not going to use tax dollars,\u201d Noskey said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s imperative that dollars go towards our students\u2019 education and I don\u2019t want to see money taken away from the kids to fix a logo thing.\u201d\n\nIn January 2017, the Michigan state government and the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi announced that they had jointly agreed to set aside up to $500,000 each year to provide \u201cMichigan schools, colleges and universities with the funds needed to improve curricula and resources related to Native American issues and mascot revisions,\u201d according to a press release.\nBelding still expects to receive a grant from the fund, called the Michigan Native American Heritage Fund, but the process is taking longer than anticipated. The fund is waiting to fill vacant board member positions before distributing money, said Jamie Stuck, Tribal Chairman of the \u00a0Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi.\nAccording to the January press release, the board will consist of two people appointed by the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, two people appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder and the director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights or a designee.\nBut until Belding receives third-party funding, the removal or alteration of symbols associated with the old name will not happen, Noskey said.\n\u201cWhether I\u2019m depending on (the Michigan Native American Heritage Fund) grant or some other grant, it would still take outside dollars to make that happen,\u201d Noskey said.\nWhile schools like Belding await compensation for making the name change, others had no issue getting financial assistance. \nFor Port Townsend high school, the cost of the changing the name from Redskins to Redhawks in mid-2013 totaled $94,235, which included new uniforms, gym floor graphics and other revisions. \nThe school paid $7,694, and the district added $61,541 to make the change. The local Jamestown Tribe of S\u2019Klallam, which supported the name change, kicked in the remaining $25,000. \n\u201cWe just extended an open hand to anything we could do to encourage (them) to make that decision,\u201d W. Ron Allen, travel chairman and CEO of the Jamestown S\u2019klallam Tribe, said. \u201cWe knew that it was going to require a cost.\u201d\nPort Townsend was happy to accept the contribution.\n\u201cThat was solely based on their decision and not any kind of negotiated amount from or by the district,\u201d Port Townsend Principal Carrie Ehrhardt said. \u201cThey said that they wanted to put something towards the mascot change, and we appreciated that.\u201d\nAlthough the tribe provided assistance with the funding, Port Townsend was ready to undergo the name change regardless. It took the school a calendar year to complete the transition.\nThe changes transformed the look of the school, said Athletic Director Lysa Falge.\nSanding the basketball court, painting a new logo, redoing the bleachers and replacing the gym scoreboard were the most expensive changes the school needed to make, about $52,000 in total, Falge said. \n\u201cThere was also the decision to have anything with the Redskin name on it be removed from the school, so older artifacts that had been hanging around, all of those were removed,\u201d she said.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Either publish the word Redskins or don\u2019t print the paper at all.\nThat was the choice school administrators at Neshaminy High School in Pennsylvania presented to student newspaper Editor-in-Chief Gillian McGoldrick when the newspaper balked at using the name of the school\u2019s official mascot. \nMcGoldrick and the paper\u2019s staff went rogue. They printed the paper without using the name, prompting the principal to seize copies of the paper and later suspend McGoldrick as editor-in-chief for a month.\n\u201cI knew that there would be backlash,\u201d McGoldrick said of the June 2014 decision. \u201cI mean, we were defying a directive from the superintendent and the principal.\u201d\n\n\nReturn to \u201cMore than a Mascot\u201d: a Capital News Service examination of Redskins high schools\n\n\nAt several high schools that have dropped the name Redskins in recent years \u2014 or, like Neshaminy, schools that are debating whether they should continue to use the name \u2014 students were deeply involved at every step of the process. In some towns, they led protests against changing the name. At others, they pushed for change and helped select a new team moniker.\n\nAt Goshen High School in Indiana, at a time when the community sentiment about the nickname was split, a committee of 24 students helped lead the move away from the use of the name. The effort was successful, at least in part because \u201cadults get (angry) at other adults, but they don\u2019t get mad at kids,\u201d according to Principal Barry Younghans.\nAt Paw Paw High School in Michigan, athletes opposed to the change showed up after practice, some wearing Redskins apparel, at a board of education discussion about changing the name. The board voted 4-3 to keep the name.\nAt Conrad Schools of Science in Delaware, students were asked to vote on new nicknames after the decision to abandon the name had already been made. They became the Red Wolves, a reference to the local Lenape Indian Tribe\u2019s \u201cwolf clan.\u201d\n\nAt Neshaminy, a school of about 2,500 students in southeast Pennsylvania near the New Jersey border, the debate over the student newspaper\u2019s use of the name has been deeply intertwined with a parallel effort to change it.\nThe seed for the battle between the student newspaper and school administrators was planted when Neshaminy parent Donna Fann-Boyle began denouncing the nickname at school board meetings in 2012. \nFann-Boyle, whose youngest son entered Neshaminy High School in the fall of 2012, spoke at over a dozen meetings, but she failed to convince the school board to stop using the name. \nSo in 2013, she filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, an agency that enforces state laws prohibiting discrimination, setting off a legal battle that continues today. \n\u201cTo have non-native students dressing up in headdresses and painting themselves, it\u2019s a stereotype,\u201d Fann-Boyle, who is part Choctaw and part Cherokee, told Capital News Service. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re saying, \u2018This is what we see Natives as, we don\u2019t see them as modern, productive citizens and a part of modern society.\u2019 They\u2019re stuck in this time warp.\u201d\nFann-Boyle\u2019s actions caught the attention of the editors of the Neshaminy monthly school newspaper, the Playwickian, a name related to a local Native American tribe.\nA Neshaminy High School event board. Photo courtesy Donna Fann-Boyle.\n\u201cWe started listening to (Fann-Boyle), and then we started having debates about (the name) and like, if it was racist,\u201d said McGoldrick, a Temple University junior who was editor-in-chief from 2013 through her graduation in 2015. \u201cWe would have debates after school and one side of the room was for the mascot name and the other was against it.\u201d\nThe debates led to the paper\u2019s editorial staff deciding in the Fall of 2013 \u2014 by a 14-7 vote \u2014 to edit out or redact the \u201cRedskins\u201d name in future editions of the paper. The Playwickian ran side-by-side editorials \u2014 one for the change, one against \u2014 to explain the decision.\nThere was significant backlash from the student body, said Tim Cho, a 2016 Neshaminy graduate who became editor-in-chief after McGoldrick graduated.\n\u201cThere was a lot of criticism over whether or not we liked the high school, whether we felt as if Neshaminy High School was a good place to be,\u201d said Cho, who supported the decision to stop using the name. \u201cBecause a lot of students equated the high school with the mascot itself.\u201d\nA few days after the editorials ran, principal Rob McGee emailed the newspaper\u2019s faculty adviser that he would \u201cban the ban\u201d of the name, as McGoldrick put it.\nMcGee did not return several phone messages and emails from Capital News Service. \nIn November 2013, McGee told the Associated Press he considered the editors\u2019 motives in refusing to use the name as \u201cvaliant\u201d but saw the situation as \u201ca First Amendment issue running into another First Amendment issue.\u201d\nChris Stanley, the school district\u2019s community relations coordinator, declined to comment. \nFor several months, the paper\u2019s editors got around the ban by simply editing the word out. \u201cIt was such an easy switch\u201d changing the \u201cNeshaminy Redskins\u201d to the \u201cNeshaminy football team\u201d, \u00a0McGoldrick said. Then, in June 2014, Neshaminy student Stephen Pirritano submitted an editorial to the Playwickian denouncing the paper\u2019s policy, calling it \u201cStalinesque.\u201d\n\u201cNo student has the right to censor another; in our paper, every student has an equal right to expression allowed under the First Amendment,\u201d Pirritano, who died in 2016, wrote in a letter published by The Morning Call newspaper. \u00a0\nThe Playwickian decided to publish Pirritano\u2019s editorial, in which the word \u201cRedskins\u201d appeared several times, redacted to read \u201cR\u2014\u2014-\u201d. When it submitted the issue to school administrators for review, McGee and then-Superintendent Robert Copeland made clear that the paper had just two choices, according to McGoldrick: publish the paper with the editorial and the word intact \u2014 or don\u2019t publish at all.\nCopeland, now superintendent of the Lower Merion School District, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. McGoldrick said it was a staff decision to print the paper with the letter from the editors, but she personally sent the final go-ahead to the printer with an email.\n\u201cI knew that this was the best decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI made sure to sign my name on the email (to the printer) because I didn\u2019t want anybody else to get in trouble.\u201d\nMcGee initially confiscated some copies from the school\u2019s hallways. He later relented and allowed the paper\u2019s staff to hand out copies of the paper at the 2014 graduation, according to McGoldrick. Copeland called the confiscation of 40 copies of the paper \u201cprudent,\u201d according to a story in the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nMcGee eventually suspended the paper\u2019s faculty adviser, Tara Huber, for two days, and suspended McGoldrick from her editor-in-chief duties. Huber could not be reached for comment. McGee also cut funding to the paper, at the approximate cost of the June issue.\nAround the same time, the district amended its policy that regulates the student newspaper. The policy now requires editors to submit the paper for prior review earlier than before and gives administrators the right to prohibit publication of material \u201cfor any reasonable reason.\u201d\nThe new guidelines also provided some protection from discipline for student editors for editorial decisions, including \u201cthe deletion of the word \u2018Redskin\u2019 from any article or editorial or for objecting to its use in any advertisement.\u201d\nWhile the Playwickian controversy was playing out, Fann-Boyle continued trying to get Neshaminy High School to change its name.\nFann-Boyle resolved to push for a change when she saw the word and Native American imagery everywhere on Back to School Night before her son\u2019s freshman year in 2012. \u201cI had to speak up, I had to say something,\u201d she said.\nThe legal division of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission found probable cause in May that the use of the name in the Neshaminy School District violates the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, which prohibits discrimination because of race or ancestry, according to David Dickieson, an attorney at Schertler & Onorato, who is working with the human relations commission on the case. \nThe human relations commission declined to confirm the finding of probable cause because the case is open, said Christina Reese, a commission media representative.\nNeshaminy School Board member Stephen Pirritano, the father of the student who wrote the editorial arguing against the newspaper\u2019s policy, told Capital News Service in an email, \u201cNeshaminy has always and will continue to be supportive of and display our heritage in a prideful and dignified manner\u2026Neshaminy is a place (where) all peoples\u2019 come together, where the bonds of community make this a special place of growth and opportunity for all.\u201d\nThe case will next go to a public hearing, likely next year, where each side will present expert testimony on the impact of the name on students, according to Dickieson. \u00a0\u00a0\nAt the student newspaper, the debate over using the name has continued. \nIn April 2016, then-co-managing editor Jessica McClelland submitted an article about the school\u2019s annual male beauty pageant, called \u201cMr. Redskin.\u201d\nThe paper\u2019s editors voted to redact the word, against McClelland\u2019s wishes. She appealed to the principal, who upheld her appeal. He directed Tim Cho, the new editor-in-chief following McGoldrick\u2019s graduation, to publish the article on the paper\u2019s website with the word.\n\u201cI was always taught to stand up for what I thought was right, not for what was the easy way out. \u00a0The easy way out would have been to redact the word,\u201d McClelland said in a Facebook message to Capital News Service.\nCho, now a student at New York University, published the article with the name redacted. That \u00a0prompted school administrators to revoke the editors\u2019 access to the website and change the article to include the word. \u00a0\n\u201cIt was my belief that the editors have the authority to determine what the guidelines for editing and publishing are, whereas the principal\u2019s role is more of a watchdog,\u201d Cho said of his decision, in a Facebook message to Capital News Service. \u201cIf we had complied with the principal\u2019s directive without challenging it, I feared it would have set a dangerous precedent.\u201d\nThis time, the consequences were different. No one was suspended and the paper didn\u2019t lose any funding, but the story remained online in its unredacted form. A month later, Cho graduated and then-junior Grace Marion succeeded him as editor-in-chief. School administrators returned access to the website to Marion, but it was a conditional return.\n\u201cI had to be completely supervised by my adviser at all times and the adviser had to change the password after each login so there could be no tampering,\u201d Marion said.\nA year and a half later, the issue is still not completely settled. Marion said she\u2019s told the staff to go back to writing around it, as they had in 2014-2015. \u201cI\u2019ve told the writers to avoid (the name) like the plague.\u201d\n-30-",

Fifth-grade teacher Edwin Amaya challenges his students with advanced math lessons in both languages, helping some, like Quenia, develop skills that extend beyond the classroom.",
    "content": "SILVER SPRING, Maryland \u2013\u2013\u2013 Step into Edwin Amaya\u2019s fifth-grade math class at Kemp Mill Elementary School and you may find yourself overwhelmed, a la \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\u201d\nIt likely won\u2019t be the mathematics that gives you trouble, but the language \u2013 unless you speak Spanish.\nAmaya\u2019s students are in the midst of a \u201cSpanish week,\u201d in which they are required to speak the language all day, every day. In Thursday\u2019s class, a small group is instructed at a round table as the others stroll around the room, solving problems taped to objects \u2013 a math scavenger hunt, if you will.\nSince 2001, Kemp Mill has offered dual-language education in English and Spanish. Students enrolled in that program receive half of their instruction in English and half in Spanish.\n\nThe language of choice alternates by week, but is limited to language arts, math, science and social studies classes. All special classes \u2013 physical education, art, music and STEM \u2013 are taught only in English.\nUntil fall 2016, the dual-language education was an optional enrichment program.\nFor the past two years, however, the school has been in the process of requiring the program for its entire student body.\nLast fall, all kindergartners were required to take English-Spanish classes, and this year, first graders joined that cluster as well. Subsequent grades will be added each year until the entire school\u2019s curriculum is taught in English and Spanish for the 2021-22 school year.\nAlthough Kemp Mill is one of three Montgomery County public schools with dual-language education, it is the only school that offers it for all students.\nAmaya teaches his fifth-grade students sixth-grade level math, in both English and Spanish, but his students have much bigger aspirations than being in the advanced math group.\nQuenia, for example, translates for her El Salvadorian mother who doesn\u2019t speak English, which makes her feel \u201clucky.\u201d\nQuenia wants to be a soldier when she grows up because of the opportunities she\u2019s been afforded.\nDual-language education, she says, has given her a glimpse of some of the sacrifices she\u2019ll be making in the military. She explains how her mother offers to take her out for ice cream and to a local park, but she often must stay home, instead opting to work to have a better grasp of English and Spanish.\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si hago esto?\u201d Quenia dreams. (\u201cWhat would happen if I did that?\u201d)\n\u201cThis country has given me food, it\u2019s given me clothes, it\u2019s given me life,\u201d Quenia explains. \u201cAnd I want to fight for this country.\u201d\nHer classmate Daniela, an 11-year old who also speaks Spanish at home, wants to be a lawyer to help those who have been wrongly imprisoned due to language barriers. She says she wants to learn French in middle school, so that she can talk to even more of her peers.\nDaniela has even noticed connections to French, given her English-Spanish background.\n\u201cWe have a French student in our class, who came last year and it was a hard time for him to communicate,\u201d Daniela says. \u201cHe\u2019s learning a lot in English and Spanish. We all helped him, and he\u2019s learned a lot of things.\u201d\nThere are 19 students in Amaya\u2019s class and according to school administrators, no class exceeds 22. Amaya asserts that the smaller classes allow for a more intimate and compassionate environment \u2013 one in which the students are encouraged to help one another acquire secondary language skills.\n\u201cThis develops these students socially,\u201d Amaya says. \u201cIt\u2019s tighter-knit when you\u2019re in dual language.\u201d\n\u201cI feel proud not just of their hard work, but for them to be thinking about that: helping others,\u201d Amaya says with a smile.\nPrincipal Bernard James echoed Amaya\u2019s sentiment, calling the program \u201ca gift.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing our students to be advocates for themselves, their families, others,\u201d James said. \u201cOur world goes far beyond Montgomery County and we\u2019re preparing them to take it, to seize it.\u201d\nJames feels that this \u201c50-50\u201d English-Spanish divide is the best way to bridge the achievement and opportunity gaps.\n\u201cWe have students from all over, so we really look to see if our potential staff are those who can come in and make an authentic connection,\u201d James says. \u201cChildren can tell whether or not you\u2019re authentic.\u201d\nAs of last year, Kemp Mill\u2019s student body was 75 percent Hispanic. That contrasts to Montgomery County Public Schools system-wide, which are 30 percent Hispanic.\nJames bedphasizes the significance of having teachers who are culturally competent and reflect their classroom\u2019s demographic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing our students to be advocates for themselves, their families, others,\u201d James says. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be so prideful to think that the only language that matters is English.\u201d\nSeveral of Amaya\u2019s students understand that, the math teacher asserts.\nHe tells of a student who just arrived from Mexico who doesn\u2019t speak English. His peers have helped him access the class\u2019s online materials and showed him how to line up in between class periods and where to put his backpack.\n\u201cThis is an amazing program,\u201d Amaya says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely humbling to be a part of it.\u201d",

    "summary": "A state panel in Maryland is reviewing a revised bill aimed at addressing school construction needs and reducing overcrowding, with an estimated $23.3 billion required for statewide improvements through 2023. The legislation seeks to prioritize funding and streamline construction processes to eliminate the use of temporary classrooms and repair aging facilities.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Building additional schools and pushing for more up-to-date, efficient and innovative design proposals is under review by a state panel charged with examining school construction.\nToday, an estimated 65,297 students in Maryland public schools are in temporary classrooms such as trailers, and there is $23.3 billion in estimated statewide school construction needed through fiscal year 2023, according to the Maryland State Department of Education and local schools.\nMaryland Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Anne Arundel and Prince George\u2019s, discussed a revised version of an earlier bill, the Maryland Overcrowding Reduction Act of 2018, at Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the 21st Century School Facilities Commission in hopes of combatting school overcrowding problems across the state.\nThe legislation did not pass last spring, however Rosapepe said he is confident in his revisions and efforts for the upcoming session.\n\u201cFacilities are one thing \u2014 we need them. I don\u2019t see us educating in cornfields. They\u2019re just as important as the programs taught,\u201d said Martin G. Knott Jr., chair of the commission.\nRosapepe explained that this $23 billion construction estimate is unaffordable, and the state and local governments will not significantly boost borrowing for schools in order to pay for all of the projects. All 24 jurisdictions have the ability to build and repair schools at much lower costs, Rosapepe told the commission.\nSchools prioritize their money in different ways, he said, and one school might spend more on a building\u2019s upkeep and another on hiring a new math teacher.\nAccording to the state\u2019s Department of Legislative Services, the average cost for a new public school is $46,000 per student, however recent construction costs in Maryland have ranged from $19,000 to $87,000 per student, a large gap that Rosapepe wants to narrow.\nThe goals of the legislation are to reduce overcrowding, repair old buildings and to end the need for portable classrooms. By designing, approving and building schools faster, reducing costs per student for new schools and incentivizing 21st century construction methods, Rosapepe said, change can be made.\nFor example, Rosapepe said, there no longer is a need for computer labs in schools now that students can bring their own devices. By cutting out an entire room, this is demonstrating 21st-century development techniques and is just one way that schools can be more cost-effective.\nSimilarly, old buildings can be converted to save money. Baltimore\u2019s Monarch Academy, which enrolls 990 students, was formerly a Coca Cola Bottling Plant.\nAccording to Rosapepe, with these strategies, the number of school construction projects can increase by 50 percent at no additional cost by just reducing the average cost per student. However, there would be no mandated changes for local school systems and governments who do not opt in to these recommendations, under the bill.\nAdditional recommendations dealt with setting funding goals and reviewing school designs. Recommendations in discussion included conducting statewide facility assessments and streamlining the review process for projects.\n\u201cThese recommendations are spot on, they are a great step forward and we support the senator\u2019s recommendations,\u201d Stephen Baldwin, a commission member, said.\nBefore the final meeting in December, Knott said, the commission will hone their recommendations and are expecting members of the commission and others to weigh in on them.\n\u201cIf anyone thinks we\u2019re stuck in the past, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re moving forward. We\u2019re taking bold initiatives,\u201d Knott said.\nAt a meeting Wednesday, Maryland\u2019s Board of Public Works unanimously approved $426 million for Baltimore City public schools\u2019 construction and revitalization \u2014 a 21st Century Schools project.\n\u2014Capital News Service correspondent Julie Depenbrock contributed to this report.",

(Georgia Slater/Capital News Service.) \n\t\t\t\t\n\nIn 2016, there were 97,857 students in Maryland enrolled in career and technology education programs across the 237 schools that offered them, according to the Maryland State Department of Education. There were 148 different continuing education programs of study offered and about 38.7 percent of high school students in Maryland participated in these programs.\nA state education commission, helmed by former University System of Maryland Chancellor William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, is weighing these programs as part of its broad look into improving Maryland schools.\nSome commission members said at last month\u2019s meeting they would like to alter the misconception that only students who do not excel in traditional academic subjects should enroll in career and technology programs, and instead that these programs should continue to develop.\nTo do so, commission members want more funding, and more involvement from businesses, said Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore.\n\u201cEvery time we can couple our programs with an industry-related certification or credential, we do,\u201d Karen B. Salmon, state superintendent of schools, told the commission.\nCareer and technology programs throughout the state, like CAT South, measure their success based on the students\u2019 successes. The carpentry program, for example, has had a 100 percent graduation rate, carpentry teacher James Turek told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\nThis year, the school offers 14 different pathways, or career programs, such as cosmetology, automotive technology, carpentry and even marine repair technology, the only program of its kind east of the Mississippi River.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of diverse kids that come through our program with a lot of different needs and wants, and we have many different programs so we can satisfy those needs, which is outstanding,\u201d Turek said.\nAside from learning the \u201chard\u201d skills that are needed for employment, commission members said, all students, including those not enrolled in a career program, should learn about the \u201csoft\u201d skills, including professionalism, attitude, problem solving and cooperative team-building skills.\n\u201cWe get them prepared for employment. They get prepared very differently than kids who go through non-CTE programs because we do offer the competitive edge when it comes to employability: We focus on those skills specifically,\u201d Turek said.\n\u201cWe have a lot of fun here, as stressful as it is,\u201d Jessica White, a junior in the information technology networking program, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different experience and I like it. It\u2019s hands-on and you get to know the material so much better than if you were reading it from a textbook.\u201d\nOnce a student completes a Maryland career program, they also have the option to earn college credits or certifications and licenses.\nMany students at CAT South have already earned certifications or are expecting to earn several by the time they graduate.\nCJ Catner, a junior in the auto technology program, said he has already earned eight certifications, and Olivia Carhart, senior cosmetology student, said she is expecting to receive her state board certification at the end of the school year.\n\u201cThe way that the teachers lay out the curriculum is how to do everything according to state board, so that we know we\u2019re doing everything safely, which has definitely prepared us for the exam,\u201d Carhart said.\nWhite said that CAT South has done a great job preparing her for the computer science field.\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely ready to go into the workplace right away but I want to go to college first to get more degrees under my belt. I have two certifications and working on getting two more,\u201d White said.\nBased on the success of these \u201ccareer and technology education\u201d programs, commission members are seeing the need for even more support.\n\u201cI like the idea of expanding (the program),\u201d said Assistant State Superintendent for the Division of Career and College Readiness Lynne Gilli. \u201cAnything that adds resources to the initiative would help.\u201d\nState aid to local jurisdictions for career and technical education statewide totaled $14,074,309 in the 2015 fiscal year. This fiscal year, the total was $13,677,310.\nIn Maryland, each local jurisdiction determines the total it will allocate for career and technology education, said Bill Reinhard, director of communications for the Maryland State Department of Education.\nTotal federal grants to states nationwide in 2016 topped $1.1 billion for career, technical and adult education.\nFor many students, the program is more than just learning their trade \u2014 it\u2019s about forming relationships.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different type of classroom, you\u2019re not required to be here, it\u2019s a choice. You elect yourself to be here so with that mindset it does make us closer and I probably spend more time with these people than anyone else\u2026I would say it\u2019s like a family,\u201d Carhart said.",

That\u2019s why we come to work everyday,\u201d said Joe Rose, principal at Center of Applied Technology-South, a public magnet vocational trade school in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.\nRose also said his school is \u201cbreaking down roadblocks and barriers\u201d in the technology field, with \u201cquite a few young women\u201d enrolled in their computer science programs.\n\u201cBased on current trends, women will hold only one in five of these \u2018jobs of the future\u2019 in America by the year 2025,\u201d said Hogan, emphasizing the lack of women employed in computer science jobs.\nThe governor also announced a partnership between the state of Maryland and Girls Who Code, creating a Governor\u2019s Club Challenge where the 23 Girls Who Code clubs in the state will compete to present their computer science projects to Hogan.\nThis first-of-its-kind challenge will also create partnerships among education and community stakeholders in the state to launch new Girls Who Code clubs and promote gender equality in the field, according to Hogan.\nHogan said the \u201cACCESS\u201d initiative grew from his membership in a group of nine governors aiming to expand access to K-12 computer science. He joined the group, part of the National Governors Association, in July.\n\u201cWe must spark the interest of students \u2013 particularly girls \u2013 beginning at an even younger age, and we must inspire high school and college students to pursue careers in computer science,\u201d Hogan said at the news conference.\nAlso on Thursday, Hogan signed an executive order directing the state\u2019s Task Force on Cybersecurity and Information Technology, part of the Governor\u2019s Workforce Development Board, to research pathways to grow the Maryland technology sector, as well as propose innovative ways to promote gender and minority equity in the STEM field.

The Knight Commission expresses deep concern over these issues, emphasizing the need for fundamental changes to ensure integrity and self-governance in higher education athletics.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The president of the NCAA said Monday that the public is losing confidence in his organization\u2019s ability to regulate college basketball and other sports, suggesting that the problem needs to be fixed quickly.\n\u201cI believe strongly today that we cannot go into the next basketball season without seeing fundamental change in the way college basketball is operating,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert told members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics at a meeting in Washington. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t have sufficient confidence in any of us. And I\u2019ll take that on myself, in terms of our ability to solve these issues.\u201d\nCollege basketball has come under special public scrutiny since federal prosecutors brought charges of bribery and fraud last month against 10 men connected to Division I basketball, including four assistant coaches. The charges connected to the University of Louisville led to the firing of basketball coach Rick Pitino.\n\u201cAll of those things are distortions of what the fundamental mission of higher education is all about,\u201d Emmert said of the bribery allegations that led to the indictments. \u201cWe need to be paying very close attention to it. And then we need to make sure that we can demonstrate to the world that we in higher education are capable of self-governance.\u201d\nKnight commission co-chair Arne Duncan said the commission was, \u201cdeeply troubled by the mounting evidence that the NCAA seems to be unable to ensure a level of integrity that has to be a priority in the education and treatment of college student-athletes,\u201d adding that the relevancy of the NCAA was at stake.\n\u201cThese threats to the integrity of college sports compel us to act in a very different way,\u201d Duncan said at a press conference following the meeting. \u201cThe status quo simply isn\u2019t working.\u201d\nThe commission was formed in 1989 to make recommendations to the NCAA to promote student-athlete well-being following a series of scandals. The commission has no formal oversight authority.\nAsked by a commissioner whether the NCAA can survive, Emmert said he believed that his organization was the best possible model for regulating college athletics.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just do the mental experiment and eliminate the NCAA. OK, then what?\u201d Emmert said. \u201cDo we create a federal ministry of sport and let the federal government run it?\u2026Do we create a new commission on college sport in America?\u2026So it really begs the question, sort of the Churchillian notion of it being the worst possible solution except for everything else.\u201d\nCo-chair Carol Cartwright, president emeritus of Bowling Green State University and Kent State University, said at the press conference that the commission was not giving up on letting higher education self-regulate, but \u201cthere need to be some more checks and balances.\u201d\nDuncan, who was education secretary under President Obama, asked whether schools found in violation of NCAA rules should be denied a portion of the billions in federally-backed grants and loans that flow to NCAA schools.\n\u201cIf that money is going out to places where there is academic fraud being perpetuated, is it worth considering?\u201d Duncan asked at the press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s viable and I don\u2019t know if the current administration would be interested, but is there a way to recoup some of that money that went to coursework that wasn\u2019t real?\u201d\nAt the meeting, Emmert also said he had problems with a system that encourages the country\u2019s top basketball talent to enter college and stay for only one year before departing for the NBA draft.\n\u201cIt makes no bloody sense\u2026If someone wants to become a professional athlete and develop the skills of becoming an athlete, they shouldn\u2019t have to go to college to do that,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cOur business is educating and developing young people. It\u2019s not giving them basketball skills.\u201d\nBut commission member David Robinson, a former All-American at the Naval Academy and NBA MVP, said the NCAA should make an affirmative case for the best players to attend college, regardless of how long they plan to stay.\n\u201cWe should be doing a better job of telling these kids, or presenting to them the opportunity of coming to college and the benefits for the long term that they will have,\u201d Robinson said. \u201c20, 30, 40 kids are going to go the NBA. The rest of y\u2019all, we\u2019re your best bet. You need to come here, you need to spend time on our campus.\u201d\n-30-",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 The state\u2019s income threshold for families to qualify for free prekindergarten should be increased by more than 60 percent, a state workgroup told a legislative panel this week.\nA state House and Senate committee weighing universal schooling for 4-year-olds met on Tuesday and acknowledged the need for an increase in funding for the early education program statewide.\nA workgroup formed to study universal access to prekindergarten was charged in April with presenting a report to the governor and the General Assembly by December.\nUniversal, high quality, full-day prekindergarten should be accessible to all 4-year-old children through a variety of programs and providers with a combination of public and private funding, the state\u2019s education department, presenting the workgroup\u2019s findings, told the panel on Tuesday.\nThe legislative committee also took into account a report published in January 2016 by Augenblick, Palaich and Associates, a consulting firm in Colorado, that highlighted the need to offer more access to prekindergarten in Maryland and increase the number of high-quality spots available to serve 80 percent of the state\u2019s 4-year-olds.\nAccording to the Colorado firm\u2019s data, 35.6 percent of 4-year-olds were enrolled in state prekindergarten in Maryland as of January 2016.\nMaryland\u2019s enrollment is similar to neighboring states\u2019 \u2014 such as Delaware and Virginia, which have 5.6 percent enrollment and 17.7 percent enrollment respectively; however, other states have rates of prekindergarten enrollment greater than 70 percent, such as Florida, Oklahoma and Vermont.\nMaryland currently mandates that each district provide at least a half day of free pre-K for 4-year-olds who are in households with incomes at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $45,510 for a family of four, according to Steven Hershkowitz of the Maryland State Education Association.\nThe income level qualification would be raised to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, or $73,800 for a family of four, over a period of at least 10 years if the workgroup\u2019s recommendations are implemented.\nThe workgroup also suggests that funds flow through the state Department of Education and be distributed to school systems and community-based programs through a grant process.\nThe change would improve access for many families in the state who can\u2019t afford a private provider, but also aren\u2019t eligible for free programs.\nSen. Nancy King, D-Montgomery, the chair of the committee, said she supports expanding pre-kindergarten, but that funding will be a challenge.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely a believer in pre-k I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d King said Tuesday. \u201cDifference in abilities is outstanding, from someone who has had pre-k and someone who hasn\u2019t. You wonder throughout the years who does catch up.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Maryland\u2019s Kirwin Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education is scheduled to discuss revising funding for state education, as well as consider the proposal for universal prekindergarten.",

Loh said.\nThe gift will be used to create faculty chairs, support additional fellowships and build additional workspaces for students at the university \u2014 and generate $100 million in financial need-based scholarships.\nMajor scholarship programs, such as the A. James Clark Scholars Program, and the Clark Opportunity Scholarship for Transfer Students, will receive more funding, influencing the academic careers of over 50 engineering students.\nCourtney Clark Pastrick, the daughter of James Clark, said that her father\u2019s ability to remember his personal challenges while in college allowed him to empathize with the needs of other students. James Clark, an engineering college alum at Maryland and founder of Clark Construction in Bethesda, often hitchhiked to school and relied on financial assistance to get an education.\nBefore he died in March 2015, Clark donated well over $40 million to a variety of projects at his namesake A.

James Clark Scholars Program there. The donation ranked as the largest scholarship gift ever made to that university.\nPublic officials and university leaders, including Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch and University System of Maryland Chancellor Robert Caret attended the announcement.

    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 A fire led to the eventual end of Phoenix \u2014 a groundbreaking Maryland public school program for children with addiction that closed in 2012 \u2014 but the state could see institutions like it rise again from the ashes.\nRecent spikes in the Maryland heroin and opioid epidemic have triggered calls for substantial changes in education systems statewide, and a state work group is weighing the return of recovery schools after a Sept. 7 meeting.\nFor Kevin Burnes, 47, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, attending a recovery school separate from his hometown high school was life-changing.\nBurnes said in a public letter that he began to experiment with drugs and alcohol at age 10, and his addiction to alcohol quickly escalated to PCP. He found himself homeless and was admitted into a psychiatric institute, he wrote.\nHowever, after finding Phoenix, a recovery program for secondary school students with addiction, and attending for two years, his whole life turned around.\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that this program undeniably saved my life,\u201d said Burnes, now a full-time musician living in Frederick, Maryland. \u201cThe largest part of Phoenix\u2019s success was due to the fact that everyone was involved. It was a community effort. It\u2019s a community issue.\u201d\nState legislation that passed this year \u2014 known as the Start Talking Maryland Act \u2014 came into effect in July and directed schools in Maryland to take precautionary measures against opioid exposure and abuse. It also established the work group.\nThe panel is charged with evaluating and developing behavioral and substance abuse disorder programs and reporting their findings to the General Assembly, according to a state fiscal analysis.\nThe legislation additionally requires:\n\u2013To store naloxone in schools and train school personnel in the drug\u2019s administration\n\u2013Public schools to expand existing programs to include drug addiction and prevention education\n\u2013Local boards of education or health departments to hire a county or regional community action official to develop these programs\n\u2013The governor to include $3 million in the fiscal 2019 budget for the Maryland State Department of Education for these policies\n\u2013Schools of higher education that receive state funding to establish these similar policies and instruction in substance use disorders in certain institutions\nMembers of the Behavioral and Substance Abuse Programs and Services Workgroup began to develop ideas on recovery schools at their meeting in Baltimore on Thursday, September 7, 2017. (Georgia Slater/Capital News Service)\nThe Phoenix program and similar secondary schools that followed it were created specifically for students in recovery from substance use disorder or dependency, according to the Association of Recovery Schools.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve known anecdotally for a while, we are starting to finally see with data. These high schools have positive effects on preventing and reducing adolescent alcohol and drug use as well as supporting the abstinence of kids post-treatment and seeing a positive impact on academics,\u201d Dr. Andrew Finch, Vanderbilt University researcher and co-founder of the Association of Recovery Schools told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\nThe first of its kind in the United States, the original Phoenix I school opened in 1979 as an alternative program in Montgomery County, Maryland, that provided both an education and a positive peer culture centered on recovery. Phoenix II followed, also in Montgomery County.\nSince then, about 40 schools have opened nationwide, according to Finch, but none remain in the state of Maryland.\n\u201cIt was amazing the support that the students gave to each other. We would have weekly community meetings where they would praise each other for their commitment, but if they weren\u2019t working toward sobriety these kids were the first ones to rat on each other,\u201d Izzy Kovach, a former Phoenix teacher told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \u201cIt was a real sense of family\u2026\u201d\nCritical to the Phoenix schools were outdoor challenges, said Mike Bucci, a former Phoenix teacher for 20 years, in a report. Along with regular days of classes and support groups, students would go from climbing 930-foot sandstone cliffs at Seneca Rocks, West Virginia, to biking the 184-mile length of the C&O Canal to sailing the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\u201cThese trips helped form lifelong bonds along with an \u2018I can\u2019 attitude,\u201d Bucci wrote.\nThe Phoenix schools at their largest enrolled about 50 students each at a time, according to a Montgomery County Public Schools report.\nAfter years of successful work, the Phoenix schools began to lose their spark. Tragedy struck in 2001 when the Phoenix II school burned down.\nHowever, instead of remaining a standalone recovery school, Phoenix II continued on as an in-school program, and eventually Phoenix I followed, according to Kovach.\n\u201cThe program lost its validity with this model (with students integrated into other alternative secondary programs in the county). The students knew it, the parents knew it, and eventually key staff left because they also saw it was ineffective,\u201d Kovach said.\nEventually, enrollment dwindled down to only three students and the Phoenix program closed its doors in 2012, according to a report compiled by a community advocacy group Phoenix Rising: Maryland Recovery School Advocates.\nFive years later, with the rise in drug use throughout the state, talk of bringing back recovery school programs have reemerged.\n\u201cWhenever you have a program where there aren\u2019t many of them, like recovery schools, people just don\u2019t don\u2019t think of them as an option. But, it is slowly changing and it\u2019s even starting to be picked up by the media,\u201d Finch said.\nThe epidemic is gathering attention and resources in Maryland \u2014 Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency from March 1 to April 30 and committed an additional $50 million over five years to help with prevention.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the number of opioid-related deaths reported in Maryland between Jan. 1 and March 31 more than doubled \u2014 taking the death toll up to 473, according to state health department data. Since then, the work group has begun to look at these numbers and is beginning to discuss various models for these new recovery programs.\nLisa Lowe, director of the Heroin Action Coalition advocacy group, said she fears that the work group will not be able to understand how to move in the right direction without having students, parents or teachers with lived experience contributing.\n\u201cInstead of just guessing what\u2019s going to work, why not ask the people who are living it?\u201d Lowe said.\nThe work group has considered either creating a regional recovery school or bringing the recovery programs into already existing schools \u2014 both models in which Burnes, Lowe and many others are not in favor.\nLowe said students in recovery need to get away from \u201cpeople, places and things,\u201d a common phrase that is used in 12-step programs. With a regional school or an in-school program, Lowe said, it is more difficult to maintain after-school programming and local peer support groups, and it will bring recovering students back to where their problems started.\nThe start-up costs for Year 1 for one recovery school are estimated to range from approximately $2,258,891 to $2,473,891 depending on whether the school is operated only for Montgomery County students or as a regional recovery school, and again should enroll about 50 students age 14 through 21 years (or Grades 8 through 12), according to a state report.\n\u201cThe overdoses are not occurring as much at the high school level, but that\u2019s where they start. They start in high school and they start in middle school. We have to get the program in place so that we don\u2019t have the deaths later on,\u201d said Kovach, the former Phoenix teacher.\nRachelle Gardner, the co-founder of Hope Academy, a recovery charter high school in Indiana, said that these recovery schools are needed all over the country to help battle this substance abuse crisis.\n\u201cAddiction is addiction, when you walk into a 12-step meeting you\u2019re in a room of addicts. You have to treat the addict in itself and we have to meet everybody where they\u2019re at regardless of their drug of choice,\u201d Gardner said.\nThe workgroup is continuing to develop their ideas for recovery schools and are expected to present their findings to the State Board of Education on Oct. 24.\n*The story has been corrected. A previous version misstated the source of a report in the 18th paragraph; and mischaracterized where students were taught once integrated into other schools.",

    "summary": "Montgomery County's diverse population has led to increased demand for language programs that help children maintain their cultural heritage, such as the Chinese-immersion program offered by Montgomery County Public Schools. These programs provide daily language instruction, which is more effective than weekly classes in helping students achieve fluency and connect with their roots.",
    "content": "POTOMAC, Maryland \u2013 Ever since Beibei Sun moved to the United States to attend college, she knew she wanted to hold on to her Chinese roots.\nNow that she has two children, she has found the best way to do that is by teaching them how to speak her first language.\nSun, who lives in Potomac, is one of many parents in the Montgomery County area who want their children to learn another language not only for future employment and travel opportunities, but also to keep their heritage alive.\n\u201cWhen you learn a new language, especially in Chinese, you have to learn where the words come from so you learn a lot about the Chinese culture,\u201d Sun said.\nThirty-four percent of Montgomery County\u2019s population is foreign-born. Of the seven districts that make up the county, two are more populated with Chinese-born people than any other nationality, according to a Capital News Service analysis.\nThe large Chinese presence has had multiple effects in the surrounding area, including in the schools.\nSun said she began speaking Chinese to her son and daughter when they were each infants, but when they became older, they stopped responding to her in Chinese. It became harder as they got older to teach them the language, especially after working all day, she said.\nShe then decided to enroll them in a local Chinese school that met for two hours per week to teach the children basic language skills.\nShe soon realized that the Chinese school wasn\u2019t improving her children\u2019s Chinese at a rate she was hoping for.\nFortunately, she heard that Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) offered language-immersion programs starting at the elementary school level. She said she immediately wanted to take advantage of what her local school system had to offer.\n\u201cIn Chinese school, it\u2019s just two hours per week so the kids don\u2019t have the motivation to do the work every day,\u201d Sun said. In the Chinese-immersion programs offered in MCPS, \u201cthey learn a little bit every day so it helps them pick up the language and they do the work each day.\u201d\nIn language-immersion programs, either all or a portion of all core subjects \u2014 for example, math, science, history \u2014 are taught in the target language, according to the MCPS World Language Immersion Program website.\nSun saw immediate improvement in her son Leo\u2019s ability to comprehend the language after he started the program in fourth grade at Potomac Elementary School.\nNow 15, Leo said he feels a sense of duty to learn Chinese since it was his parents\u2019 first language. He is now enrolled in Honors Chinese 5 at Churchill High School.\nAlthough he\u2019s only in his sophomore year of high school, he said plans to continue to take Chinese courses through college as his sister does.\nThe Chinese-immersion programs not only teach the students the language, but also about Chinese culture.\nThat appeals to some parents outside the Chinese community.\n\u201cExposing them to something different from what they know\u2026 it helps their brains grow,\u201d said Lola Tobun, whose son, Ayo, is in seventh grade and enrolled in the Chinese-immersion program at Herbert Hoover Middle School.\nTobun grew up in Nigeria speaking Yoruba and learned French in school. She teaches Ayo and her younger daughter \u2014 who attends Cold Spring Elementary\u2019s gifted and talented program \u2014 about Nigerian culture as well. Although she does not know how to speak Chinese, she was excited that her son had the opportunity to learn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a skill. Every skill you learn now is going to be useful. It doesn\u2019t cost him anything to learn it,\u201d Tobun said. \u201cThe future is Chinese. It\u2019s one of the languages \u2013 from what I\u2019ve read and everything \u2013 it\u2019s a good language and the language of the future.\u201d\nThe language-immersion programs in MCPS began nearly 40 years ago with the installation of a French language immersion program and its goal is to promote bilingual literacy, according to the supervisor of world languages in MCPS, Francoise Vandenplas.\n\u201cIt was all based on interest from parents who found that, in Canada, this was one way that French was alive and well,\u201d Vandenplas said.\nMCPS now offers language-immersion programs in Chinese, French and Spanish at seven elementary schools across the county and four middle schools.\nImmersion programs are not offered in the high schools, but students choose to take their preferred language level course.\nIn determining which specific language would be offered for a school\u2019s immersion program, Vandenplas said that the surrounding demographic plays a major role.\n\u201cA lot has to do with community stakeholders and input from communities where the county is looking into creating a program,\u201d Vandenplas said. \u201cFor Chinese, one (elementary) school is located in Potomac and there are definitely a lot of Chinese-born parents who have an interest in immersion.\u201d\nTobun said that Ayo, who began learning Chinese at Potomac Elementary School, has frequent opportunities to speak Chinese outside of the classroom. She said she has some friends who will speak to him in Chinese.\nSun and her husband are \u201cmostly social with Chinese\u201d and many of her coworkers are Chinese, which gives Leo more opportunities to hear and speak with other people outside of school.\n\u201cI remember\u202612 years ago when I started teaching, only about 10 percent (of the students) came from Chinese-speaking homes,\u201d said Shu-Ju Liu, a Chinese language teacher at Herbert Hoover Middle School. said. She said that now that number has increased to 16 to 20 percent of her students.\n\u201cI think that more and more in the U.S., people realize what an asset it is to be bilingual. Our current world is becoming more global and we can\u2019t assume everyone speaks English,\u201d Vandenplas said. \u201cFor this community, it\u2019s a lot about keeping the heritage alive.\u201d\nAll the other languages offered provide both partial- and full-immersion options. Vandenplas said the Chinese program is only offered as partial immersion because of a variety of factors, including availability of resources and community input.\nAnother factor for only offering partial immersion is that many of the students who are enrolled in the program come from Chinese-speaking homes, so learning fundamentals of English grammar and language are equally important, Vandenplas said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for their learning. For my kids, they \u2018get it\u2019 and understand what another culture is about\u2026. When you talk about another culture, they\u2019re not judgmental about it,\u201d Tobun said. \u201cFor me, I think it is a good idea to expand the program to have every kid living in Montgomery County experience that.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday overturned an Obama administration directive on campus sexual assault that may have long-ranging implications for the more than 300,000 college and graduate students in Maryland. \n\u201cThe era of rule by letter is over,\u201d said DeVos, referring to the 2011 guidelines set in place by President Barack Obama governing cases of sexual misconduct under a 1972 law known as Title IX. \nTitle IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational institutions receiving federal aid and described sexual harassment and violence as forms of discrimination. \nObama\u2019s 2011 \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter set out new obligations that the Department of Education would enforce involving sexual assaults at colleges and universities. Although the letter was not enforced as a law, colleges have followed it.\nCritics of the letter say that the guidelines have been used to unfairly demonize anyone accused of sexual violence without evidence. Supporters say the guidelines make it easier for survivors of sexual assault to report their experiences without fear of backlash.  \nWhile a new framework is still in development, DeVos made clear that the Department of Education would roll back much of the earlier guidance. \n\u00a0\n\nInstead of fighting against for-profit college shams, DeVos has decided to retreat from our fight against campus sexual assault\u2014disgraceful. https://t.co/sRkGeoORtq\n\u2014 Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) September 7, 2017\n\n\u00a0\nUniversity of Maryland spokeswoman Katie Lawson said the school remained committed to \u201ca campus free of sexual violence.\u201d \n\u201cThe university will advocate for the safety of our students as we await the public review period announced today by the Department of Education,\u201d she said.\nThe Maryland Higher Education Commission declined to comment on the matter when contacted, saying it was too early to assess the impact of the announcement. \nAFT President Randi Weingarten, a sexual assault survivor, accused DeVos of siding with \u201cthose who want to roll back the clock.\u201d\n\u201cDeVos is right that we need systemic reform, but it\u2019s this country\u2019s ingrained campus rape culture that needs changing, not the law that challenges it,\u201d Weingarten said in a statement. AFT, known as the American Federation of Teachers, represents 1.7 million primary and secondary school teachers, college professors and staff, government employees and healthcare workers.   \nCalling DeVos\u2019s move \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in a tweet, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., stated that the priorities of her agency would be better focused on \u201cfighting against for-profit college shams.\u201d\nThe YWCA USA tweeted that \u201csurvivors deserve an administration that stands with them.\u201d \nUnder the Obama administration guidelines, schools were told to use the lowest standard of proof, called \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d in prosecuting sexual assault cases. \nIn an address at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School, DeVos said colleges must raise the burden of proof in order to protect the rights of both victims and those that they accuse because \u201cthe system established by the prior administration has failed too many students.\u201d\n\u201cAny perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation, but if everything is harassment, then nothing is harassment,\u201d said DeVos, a statement which drew criticism for equating the harm done to falsely accused students with the suffering of assault survivors.  \n\u201cWashington has insisted that schools step into roles that go beyond the mission of these institutions,\u201d said DeVos. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean schools don\u2019t have a role. They do. But we should also draw on medical professionals, counselors, clergy, and law enforcement for their expertise.\u201d\nDeVos consistently returned to the theme that schools must be mindful of all the rights of all students both victims and accused students, saying that the current system provided no justice to either party and that educational institutions were often too quick to punish students through school tribunals based on flimsy evidence. \n\u201cEvery survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously,\u201d said DeVos, adding that those accused of sexual misconduct must also not feel like they have been judged guilty without a fair chance to defend themselves. \nDeVos\u2019 proposed changes were praised by Robert Shibley, executive director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit group that aims to defend individual rights at colleges and universities including \u201cfreedom of speech, legal equality, due process, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly as a civil libertarian you know it\u2019s very obvious that it kicked of an effort by the department to redefine Title IX enforcement in a way that made it clear that due process was going to be in some cases totally ignored in favor of attempts to fight sexual assault on campus,\u201d said Shibley.\nWhile DeVos said the system can improve to become more \u201ceffective and fair,\u201d some advocacy groups believe that these new guidelines will only help the accused.\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, blasted DeVos, saying she was continuing \u201ca pattern of undermining survivors\u2019 rights, once again showing a clear lack of understanding or empathy for the millions of students who have experienced sexual violence on campus.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Secretary DeVos just made an open invitation to colleges to once again sweep this national epidemic under the rug, which could discourage women and men on campuses across the country from reporting sexual assault and deprive survivors of the justice they deserve,\u201d Murray said.  \n\u201cWe know that no system is perfect, but we absolutely disagree that what (DeVos) is trying to do is make the system more fair,\u201d said Annie E. Clark, executive director of End Rape on Campus, a national nonprofit organization involved in organizing student survivors and families who protested outside of DeVos\u2019s speech. \n\u201cSurvivors and advocacy groups were not a part of this announcement or meeting \u2013 in fact we were not even allowed in the room,\u201d said Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s a veiled insult. This is a blatant attack on the civil rights of survivors.\u201d\nHigh school and university students and their families were part of the crowd gathered outside to share their stories around issues of sexual violence and upholding Title IX, said Clark.\n\u201cWe were told by reporters and others in the announcement with DeVos that they could hear us chanting outside,\u201d said Clark. \u201cSo as she was talking about listening to survivors, you had this very clear picture that survivors were not being allowed in.\u201d \n\u201cSurvivors can\u2019t learn when their rapists sit behind them in math class, or live down the hall of their dorm, especially without accommodations and support from their schools,\u201d said Advocates for Youth in a press release. \u201cBut too often, schools don\u2019t respect survivors\u2019 rights, provide help, or investigate their reports.\u201d \nKnow Your IX, a project of Advocates for Youth that works directly with students, was one of several groups protesting. \n\u201cToday, Secretary DeVos sent the message to student and survivors across the country that the Department of Education doesn\u2019t have their back,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cDeVos and the Trump Administration have given us every indication their goal isn\u2019t equality, but helping abusers and rapists avoid accountability.\u201d\nOne of Devos\u2019 main points was that the accused don\u2019t get due process because colleges want to help appease the victim. \n\u201cThe notion that schools must diminish due process to better serve the victim only creates more victims,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cThe rights of one person can never be paramount to the rights of another.\u201d\nWhen asked whether he believed the changes DeVos proposes will lead to an increase in campus sexual assault, Shibley responded \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s very much of a risk that all of a sudden people who are engaging in sexual misconduct on campus will go scot free.\u201d\nThe specifics of a new process for handling sexual assault on campuses are yet to come.\n\u201cWe will launch a transparent notice and comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way,\u201d the secretary said. \u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective and fair system.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Maryland lawmakers voted Thursday to override Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of a bill that would specify which measures could be considered when determining a school\u2019s quality, prohibiting student testing from being one of them.\nThe bill restricts the state\u2019s ability to intervene in failing schools, which opponents worry is intended to limit the creation of charter schools and voucher systems.\nThe House of Delegates passed the override of the governor\u2019s veto 90-50, and the Senate passed it the same day, 32-15.\nHogan, a Republican, vetoed House Bill 978, known as the Protect Our Schools Act of 2017, Wednesday, saying the bill weakens school accountability, according to a release from the governor\u2019s office. In the press release, Hogan urged legislators to put aside politics and sustain the veto.\nThe Maryland State Board of Education and the Maryland State Department of Education have sided with the governor in opposition to this bill, according to the release. \nThursday morning, advocates for the bill gathered at a rally to call for an override. Those present included representative from the Maryland State Education Association, the Maryland Parent Teacher Association and some lawmakers. \nThe bill would help accommodate the needs of the students and allow parents to be involved in the process, Delegate Mary Washington, D-Baltimore, told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \u201cWe need to do more to end disparities (in education) \u2026 we cannot do that giving control to the state,\u201d Washington said.\nBill Sponsor Delegate Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, acknowledged the common goal that both sides of the argument shared. \u201cI\u2019m glad we can agree every kid deserves a good education,\u201d Luedtke said on the floor.\nAlthough the State Board of Education opposes the bill, people who are involved in the everyday lives of children, like teachers and parents, support the bill, according to Luedtke.\nMultiple delegates opposed to the bill referred to it as a \u201cstatus quo\u201d initiative on the floor, saying the bill will not bring any noticeable change that would benefit students.\nDelegate Nicholaus Kipke, R-Anne Arundel, the House minority leader, said on the floor that this bill is not complicated. \n\u201cIt traps students in failing schools and lessens accountability in the bureaucracy in education,\u201d he said. Kipke made a point to say the legislation is regressive and takes tools away from the state. \nSince both chambers voted to override the governor\u2019s veto, the bill will become law July 1.",
