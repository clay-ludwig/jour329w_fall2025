    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0 The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has advanced a Republican-sponsored bill that includes measures repealing key aspects of the Biden administration\u2019s plans to make college more affordable.\nThe College Cost Reduction Act, introduced by the panel\u2019s chairwoman, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, passed on a party-line 22-19 vote.\nThe measure presents numerous programs intended to strengthen the integrity of higher education institutions across the country, but also would gut much of President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to help students afford college. Democrats on the committee offered a series of amendments to the bill aimed at blocking the GOP repeals, but all were defeated.\n\u201cUnfortunately, President Biden has decided time and time again that the executive branch should also hold the legislative pen,\u201d said Foxx, \u201cCongress has the task of creating laws that reflect the interests of the people. It is not the role of the executive pen.\u201d\nLast August, the Biden administration launched the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) program, aiming to cancel debt to borrowers who originally owed $12,000 or less in loans and had repaid at least ten years of those loans.\nThe program is slated to begin in February, with 6.9 million Americans already enrolled, according to the White House.\nBiden\u2019s original plan, as laid out in his 2022 executive order to cancel up to $430 billion in student loans, was blocked by the Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision last June. The court determined that the secretary of education lacked the power to issue debt relief on the scale described in the administration\u2019s plan.\nLast September, Foxx introduced a resolution with Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, to nullify the SAVE plan, but the full House never voted on it.\nFoxx\u2019s College Cost Reduction Act, introduced in January, would establish a streamlined data system to convey information about colleges, create a performance-based grant program, and hold academic institutions responsible for unpaid student loans.\nIn the committee meeting to consider the bill, Democrats introduced 30 amendments to alter some fundamental aspects of the legislation.\u00a0\nRep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, praised parts of Foxx\u2019s bill, \u201csuch as codifying Postsecondary Student Success Grants and eliminating interest capitalization and origination fees on student loans,\u201d but the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat objected to some provisions that he said would make it harder for people to go to college.\nRep. Kathy Manning, D-Michigan, offered an amendment to strike language from the bill repealing Biden administration regulations to protect student borrowers during changes in ownership of academic institutions.\u00a0\nAnother Biden administration regulation the Foxx bill aims to repeal is the 90-10 rule, which requires for-profit universities to secure at least 10 percent of their funding from non-federal sources. Rep. Mark Takano, D-California, introduced an amendment to strike this section from the final bill but was rebuffed by the GOP majority.\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Michigan, offered a motion to remove the bill\u2019s rescission of Biden\u2019s SAVE plan, but that motion was defeated.\n\u201cThe new (SAVE) program created by the Biden administration\u2026 creates a generous IDR (income-driven repayment) plan that Republicans now want to strip away,\u201d Omar said.\nRep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Michigan, unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill with language streamlining the process of finding on-campus accommodations for students with disabilities.\nBonamici\u2019s proposal is part of a group of bills unveiled Monday by Democratic members of the education panel referred to collectively as the Roadmap to College Student Success.",

    "summary": "Advocates for HBCUs are urging increased security funding following shootings at Morgan State University and Bowie State University during homecoming events, with Rep. Alma Adams calling for a concerted effort from the Biden administration to address safety concerns.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 After the back-to-back shootings\u00a0in October\u00a0at Morgan State University and Bowie State University, advocates for\u00a0Historically Black Colleges and Universities\u00a0(HBCUs)\u00a0say that underfunding is leading to lack of proper safety and security resources on\u00a0their campuses.\nTheir concerns have drawn support from Capitol Hill.\nRep. Alma Adams, D-North Carolina, and the founder of the Congressional HBCU Caucus,\u00a0sent letters\u00a0to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Dr. Miguel Cardona and\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,\u00a0saying there needs to be a \u201cconcerted effort to provide funding to HBCUs for them to protect their student body and faculty\u00a0from violence.\u201d\nShe added that safety and security on HBCU campuses must be a \u201ctop priority\u201d and requested that her office meet regularly with the Biden administration to discuss funding\u00a0and safety concerns.\nOn Oct. 3, five people were injured after a shooting on Morgan State\u2019s campus during homecoming festivities. Just four days later, two people were injured after a shooting on Bowie State\u2019s\u00a0campus, also during homecoming.\nRyan Coleman, president of the Randallstown NAACP, was on Bowie State\u2019s campus visiting family when the shooting happened. The police presence on campus that night was not\u00a0sufficient, he said.\n\u201cYou saw some police\u2026but it became really obvious that they weren\u2019t walking around the campus\u2026they weren\u2019t patrolling like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were multiple events on the campus\u00a0with multiple people. And there just wasn\u2019t any police presence at those individual events.\u201d\nColeman described the scene during the shooting as \u201cchaos.\u201d While\u00a0sheltering\u00a0in a dorm with his family, he said he saw people running and trying to get off campus, and that the police\u00a0didn\u2019t start evacuating campus until about an hour later.\n\u201cThe Bowie State University Police were over their heads, it was obvious they did not have the police resources to handle this,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIf there was an active shooter who actually\u00a0wanted to do harm to students, I have no faith that that person would\u2019ve been stopped at all.\u201d\nAfter the shooting, Bowie State President Aminta Breaux said the school\u00a0would\u00a0revisit the idea of adding metal detectors to campus, but emphasized that \u201cno one person has the solution to\u00a0all the challenges the university faces.\u201d\nBowie State University did not respond to a request for comment about the police presence during the shooting there.\nAt Morgan State, President David K. Wilson announced his plan to extend a fence barrier around campus, saying it will help limit \u201cunfettered pedestrian access.\u201d\nThe school also said it plans to hire more police officers, implement more security cameras around campus and add metal detectors at entrances. The measures will cost millions of dollars\u00a0and the school said it hopes to receive additional state and federal funding.\nAfter watching the shooting unfold at Morgan State, Coleman wrote a letter to the president of Howard University, where his daughter is enrolled, urging the school to take action during its\u00a0homecoming celebration in October, including increasing police presence and adding metal detectors at entrances to events, among other precautions.\nAt\u00a0its\u00a0homecoming celebration, Howard\u00a0officials\u00a0said that safety was their \u201cmain priority\u201d ahead of the events, and the school had its campus police and Metro police patrolling campus.\nOn Monday, college officials across Maryland gathered behind closed doors to discuss campus safety in the wake of the Morgan State shooting. They discussed prevention\u00a0technology on campus, and the importance of doing checks on existing security measures, like security cameras, according to WBAL in Baltimore.\nCampus officials also emphasized the importance of community policing, and that schools should partner with surrounding police departments.\nColeman said that when he has\u00a0visited the University of Maryland or other non-HBCUs in Maryland, those institutions seem to have the resources they need, whether it\u2019s funding,\u00a0programming or security on campus.\nMaryland\u00a0HBCU Advocates spokeswoman Sharon Blake echoed Coleman, saying that underfunding at the institutions is widespread, whether it is in programming, scholarships or security.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have enough money, you cut corners wherever you can. And that, of course, does include public safety, and that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Blake said.\nIn Congress, Adams has passed many bills\u00a0that\u00a0supporting HBCUs. Last year, in the wake of bomb threats against HBCU campuses across the country, Adams passed a\u00a0resolution that condemned violence at HBCUs and reaffirmed Congress\u2019s support for these schools.\nIn 2019, Adams also passed legislation that established two fiscal years\u2019 worth of mandatory funding for minority-serving institutions.\nEarlier this year, the\u00a0United Negro College Fund (UNCF) proposed legislation that would direct $100 million each year from FEMA\u2019s non-profit grants security program to go\u00a0towards safety initiatives on HBCU campuses. Adams\u2019 office said she is \u201cstrongly in favor\u201d of this proposal.\nIn terms of federal funding, the Biden-Harris administration has invested over $7 million in the nation\u2019s HBCUs, and has directed money in the 2022 and 2023 spending\u00a0packages, specifically supporting scholarships and grants, as well as institutional development.\nWhile the administration has not specifically increased funding for campus safety in reference to shootings, the Department of Education did secure over $2 million in grants\u00a0to help schools recover after violent events, such as bomb threats.\nAdditionally,\u00a0in September, the Biden administration sent letters to the governors of 16 states, including Maryland, asking them to\u00a0direct\u00a0more money for their land-grant HBCUs.\nIn the letters, Cardona and Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack\u00a0said they\u00a0found that the states\u2019 land-grant HBCUs received a collective $13 billion less than they should have in the last\u00a0few decades, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics.\nMaryland\u2019s land-grant HBCU is the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which the analysis found to have a $321 million funding gap in state appropriations in the last 30 years, compared\u00a0to the predominantly white land-grant universities in the state, including the University of Maryland College Park.\n\u201cThe longstanding and ongoing underinvestment in University of Maryland Eastern Shore disadvantages the students, faculty, and community that the institution serves,\u201d the two secretaries\u00a0wrote. \u201cIt is our hope that we can work together to make this institution whole after decades of being underfunded.\u201d\nThe letter also acknowledges that the state government has been making steps toward addressing the funding gap in recent years.\nIn 2021, then-Gov. Larry Hogan approved legislation giving $577 million to Maryland HBCUs over a decade,\u00a0which Moore has said he will uphold, according to his office.\nMoore allocated $422 million for all four schools in his first budget, and in February approved $3 million in grants to three schools, including Morgan State and Bowie State.\u00a0Since Moore\u00a0took office, funding for Maryland HBCUs has increased over 20%, according to his office.\nMoore\u2019s office said that he \u201cfirmly believes that every student deserves to feel safe on campus and that everyone involved needs to work hard to ensure that these tragedies\u00a0no longer take place in Maryland.\u201d\nBut even the increased funding and support still does not rectify decades of underfunding, Coleman\u00a0said.\n\u201cEven if (HBCUs) are given some money\u2026they\u2019ve been underfunded for 30 or 40 years, and they\u2019re not really being brought to a whole,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Despite challenges like teacher vacancies and late arrivals due to security protocols, some incarcerated youth in Maryland's juvenile facilities are achieving educational milestones, such as earning GEDs. However, two years after the transfer of educational responsibilities to a new school board within the Juvenile Services Department, many students still face significant barriers to consistent education.",
    "content": "SABILLASVILLE, Md. \u2014 The graduate\u2019s mom, peers and teachers knew he was going to reach his goal, though his principal, Todd Rasher, said the other students incarcerated at the Victor Cullen Center in rural northern Frederick County didn\u2019t see \u201call the footwork\u201d it took to earn his GED.\n\u201cThis diploma ain\u2019t really too much because I knew that I was going to get it,\u201d the 17-year-old said to his graduation audience on Oct. 18, wearing a cap and gown, kente stole and black wristband adorned with, \u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d\u00a0\nThe graduate, whose identity CNS is shielding because he is a minor, was charged as an adult before his case was transferred to juvenile court. Rasher said he passed the tests necessary to earn his GED on the first try, inspiring his fellow students to take the tests themselves.\u00a0\nThe graduate\u2019s mom, TaNeya Anderson, said that services she and her son received since her son was locked up, including family therapy and regular updates from Cullen staff, have helped her family.\u00a0\n\u201cIt might seem like it was a bad thing that he ended up having to get incarcerated, but I\u2019m always trying to get the good out of it, and I believe it was meant for this to happen this way,\u201d Anderson said.\nNot all incarcerated young people are able to continue their education, much less attain a degree. Two years after the Maryland General Assembly transferred responsibility for incarcerated students\u2019 education from the state Education Department to an independent school board within the Juvenile Services Department, students confined in Maryland\u2019s secure youth facilities continue to face multiple long-standing challenges, according to experts and state audit reports.\n\nTeacher vacancy rates of 30% in the most populous Juvenile Services schools have led to reliance on streaming instruction in subjects such as math and science.\nIncarcerated students were late to class hundreds of times in 2023 due to the security requirements \u2014 especially a state Juvenile Services policy mandating that staff supervise and escort youth while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio.\u00a0\nA lack of guidance from the State Board of Education has allowed local school boards broad scope to reject students charged with various offenses, including those who have been in detention, arguing they are a threat \u2013 even when Juvenile Services and the courts have decided it\u2019s safe to release them.\n\nTwo of the state\u2019s three most populous youth detention centers and its only long-term placement facility, Cullen, operated with teacher vacancy rates around 30% as of early October, according to documents discussed in public meetings of the Juvenile Services Education Program Board. The Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, which served 301 students that year, had eight vacancies. The Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, which served 245 students, had seven. Cullen, which served 76 students, had four.\nWhen facilities lack subject experts to teach in person, students take classes livestreamed by juvenile services teachers from the Garrett Children\u2019s Center, a former youth committed placement center in Garrett County.\u00a0\nThree of the nine Juvenile Services schools, including Hickey and Cullen, had no math teacher as of October, while four, including Hickey and the Baltimore center, lacked a science teacher. Baltimore\u2019s Juvenile Justice Center was looking for a second math teacher to serve its large population.\u00a0\nDavid Domenici, director of education and senior adviser to the Juvenile Services secretary, said streaming instruction is \u201cnot ideal\u201d for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of students but better than packets of photocopied activities.\nJuvenile Services teacher vacancies have persisted through tensions between Maryland\u2019s education and Juvenile Services agencies over the past decade about who bears responsibility for educating incarcerated young people and how best to do so. Those vacancies continue through teachers\u2019\u00a0 lack of summer and winter breaks and low pay relative to teachers employed by local school districts.\nLawmakers voted in 2004 to stage the Education Department\u2019s takeover of Juvenile Services schools over eight years but repeatedly extended the timeline as Education protested inadequate funding. Bills seeking pay parity and summer breaks for juvenile services teachers failed in 2016, 2019 and 2020, often pitting experts from Education and Juvenile Services against each other. The General Assembly established a statewide education board within Juvenile Services in 2021 in response to monitors\u2019 and advocacy groups\u2019 repeated findings of high staff turnover and vacancies, inadequate services for learning disabled students and a lack of support for students returning to community schools. But the law did not require pay parity or align facilities\u2019 teaching calendar more closely with local schools.\nPeter Leone, an emeritus University of Maryland education professor contracted by the Education Department to assess its work in Juvenile Services facilities between 2016 and 2018, said that educating incarcerated students was \u201ca very low priority\u201d for the Education department.\nThe Education Department declined to comment on its management of Juvenile Services education or on the current board.\nWhile public school teachers earn salaries set by local school boards, Juvenile Services teachers are paid on a single, statewide pay scale. Juvenile services teachers experience the greatest pay disparities in jurisdictions where local school boards pay the most.\u00a0\nThe Juvenile Services board has implemented hiring and retention bonuses that board superintendent Kim Pogue said she hopes will improve recruitment.\nEven with these bonuses, teachers in the state\u2019s largest youth detention centers, in Baltimore and Prince George\u2019s County, earn less per day than teachers working in local schools. A teacher at Hickey or Baltimore\u2019s Juvenile Justice Center makes 9.5% less daily than a teacher in neighboring Baltimore County. A teacher at Cheltenham makes 3.9% less than a Prince George\u2019s County teacher. In Washington County, teachers at the Western Maryland Children\u2019s Center make 10.2% less than county teachers.\nDomenici said the board would have to decide whether to seek legislative or other changes to teacher pay and work schedules. Domenici, who is not a board member, said the legislature should have set 10- and 12-month employee categories, established a school calendar limiting when Juvenile Services teachers can take leave and creating a regional pay scale aligned with local districts.\nBut lost instructional time is greatest due to a lack of residential advisers, according to audits of Juvenile Services schools by the state Office of the Inspector General. Departmental policy requires that residential staff escort students from their living units to classrooms while maintaining a minimum staff-to-youth ratio. When there aren\u2019t enough residential staff, students don\u2019t move.\u00a0\nStudents were late to class 203 times across Juvenile Services facilities due to residential staff shortages between April and June alone, according to the audits. Teachers had to teach class inside the living units 43 times in the 90-day inspection period.\nGetting students in the classroom, even if they are late, Domenici said, is better than class on the living units. The department is working toward a goal of 90% on-time attendance in school by shifting all onsite adults to escort students to school, he said.\nSpending time in detention or committed placement hurts students\u2019 education in the longer term.\nLegal experts and youth advocates say students who have been detained face obstacles returning to school due to overly broad state laws and an absence of guidance to local school systems from the Department of Education.\nLaw enforcement is required to report to superintendents and principals when students are charged with certain \u201creportable offenses\u201d outside of school, including rape, first degree assault and carjacking.\nExperts say a 2022 state law limiting when local school systems can exclude students based on charges does not lay out a statewide standard to assess whether students present a threat nor outline procedures to protect students\u2019 and parents\u2019 rights.\u00a0\nRegulations that the State Board of Education has proposed to flesh out the law provide insufficient protections, according to comments submitted by the Public Defender\u2019s Office, Disability Rights Maryland and the Public Justice Center.\nAlyssa Fieo, assistant public defender for education in the Juvenile Protection Division of the Maryland Public Defender\u2019s Office, said she has worked on a handful of cases involving reportable offenses in at least five counties since the passage of the 2022 law.\nSchools failed to hold required meetings between parents and school officials before students\u2019 removal to establish whether students presented a threat, and schools don\u2019t invite students\u2019 attorneys when they do. In one case, the school system did not hold a required meeting to determine whether the alleged offense was a manifestation of a student\u2019s disability before removing the student. In most of the cases, students were recently released from detention.\n\u201cA handful of the cases I\u2019ve represented, the family got a phone call saying, \u2018We understand your child has a charge. They\u2019re going to be put on virtual school. We\u2019re going to drop off the computer,\u2019\u201d Fieo said.\nState law requires the state\u2019s attorney to promptly notify school officials of the ruling on a student\u2019s case, and the proposed regulations would require schools to then review the student\u2019s school assignment. The three organizations are asking the Education Department to clarify that students should be allowed to return to school once the state\u2019s attorney, Juvenile Services and the courts have approved the student\u2019s return to the community. There is currently no limit on how long a \u201creportable offense\u201d charge can be used as a reason to exclude a student from regular instruction.\nAt Cullen, Rasher said, he has access to any student\u2019s record, but he chooses not to look.\n\u201cI know everybody has a story,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are pretty awful. But to me, that\u2019s not a thing.\u201d\nThe day the graduate walked up to the podium and moved his tassel from one side of his cap to the other, he focused on his future: He was set to start work on an occupational safety certification the next day.\nThe graduate said Cullen\u2019s walls enclose a complex reality that outsiders can\u2019t see, and that the youth of Cullen are just as complex.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just judge a book by its cover like they say, for real,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of us in here, our cover is just what they show on the media or the news, you feel me, but they don\u2019t know what actually goes on inside of here. \u2026If you\u2019re on the outside looking in, you\u2019re not going to see what we see. Because we here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what I did,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely proud about it, but it\u2019s more to come, so.\u201d",

Baltimore City saw the most significant improvement in English proficiency, while four counties experienced a decline in math proficiency.",
    "content": "College Park, Md. \u2014 The results for the 2023 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP) tests for grades 3 to 8 show that student proficiency in English Language Arts has surpassed the level it was at before the pandemic. Math scores have improved, but have yet to fully rebound from the pandemic, while science scores have declined, according to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE).\nMCAP tests are administered annually in public schools to assist educators in understanding student progression so that they can better tailor their methods of instruction, according to MSDE.\nStudents in grades three to eight take tests in English and math, while students in grades five and eight are given an additional science test.\nEnglish proficiency surpasses 2019\nAccording to data from MSDE, average English proficiency dropped from 44% in 2019 to 31% in 2021.\nProficiency increased significantly in 2022 and by a smaller degree in 2023, with results showing an average passing rate of 47%, according to MSDE.\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\n\nImprovements can be seen across Maryland, as every county except Somerset had an increase in English proficiency between 2022 and 2023. Somerset County had a slight 0.3 % decrease in scores. Baltimore City had the most improvement with 22%.\n\nMath proficiency still below pre-pandemic levels\nThe 24% average passing rate for math in 2023 is still lower than the 31% in 2019, indicating that math scores have still not fully recovered from pandemic learning loss.\nDespite average passing rates in math still not being as high as in 2019, they have gone up since dropping to 15% in 2021. Proficiency increased by 6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and 3 percentage points from 2022 to 2023.\n\nNot every county had an improvement, as there are four counties that saw a decline in average math proficiency from 2022 to 2023: Baltimore, Kent, Somerset and Talbot. Baltimore County had a significant 15% drop in math proficiency from 2022.\n\nBaltimore County Public Schools Board of Education Member at Large Tiara Booker-Dwyer said that an explanation for the slower improvement in math scores is that the format of math questions in these tests have become more layered, which makes it difficult for parents, teachers and administrators trained in the traditional format to help students get accustomed.\n\u201cNot only do you have to have that English language proficiency to understand \u2018what is this question asking,\u2019 then you also have to have that mathematic skill set to do the problem,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a little bit longer for students to truly master, it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer for teachers to truly master how to facilitate instruction on it.\u201d\nHistorically underserved students lag behind\nDespite making improvements over the last two years, average scores for historically underserved students in English and math still lag behind. The most recent scores of Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaska Native students are still below those of white and Asian students.\n\nBooker-Dwyer said that it is important to build the cultural competency of educators so that they can connect better with students.\n\u201cWhen you look at the curriculum that was developed, it speaks to a certain demographic. There are certain people who just \u2018I\u2019m not going to connect with this,\u2019 so it\u2019s going to go in one ear and out the other. Or when they try to connect to it, people recognize that it\u2019s inauthentic,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said.\nBooker-Dwyer states that another solution is encouraging more historically underserved students to take honors and AP classes, as well as providing resources to schools to give them these opportunities.\n\u201cWhat the research shows is that if you\u2019re placed in an advanced academic class or gifted class, even if you\u2019re earning C\u2019s in there, you\u2019re better off long term than if you\u2019re just in the standard class,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just exposure to certain things, just being in a classroom, around students who are performing at a certain level will kind of unintentionally make you perform at a higher level,\u201d she said.\nGrade 8 science proficiency hits five-year low\nScience scores continue to lag, especially for grade 8.\nIn grade 5, science proficiency in the last five years peaked in 2021 at 41%, a 12-percentage point increase from 2019. In 2022, the passing rate dropped to 31% before rising again to 35% in 2023, according to MSDE.\nGrade 8 scores have been on a steady decline since 2021, with the passing rate dropping from 35% in 2022 to 26% in 2023, the lowest it\u2019s been in the last five years.\n\nWith the exception of Dorchester, every county had at least a 10% decline in grade 8 science proficiency from 2022 to 2023. Six counties had over a 30% decrease from 2022: Kent, Charles, Prince George\u2019s, Washington, Allegany and Queen Anne\u2019s.\n\nMSDE states that this decline is likely due to the grade 8 students being in grade 6 during the 2020-2021 school year, which was predominantly online. As a result, students missed key science instruction during their first year of middle school.\n\u201cThe results on the grade 8 assessment make clear the impact of grade 6 and 7 disruptions on a cumulative grade 8 assessment,\u201d MSDE said in the press release.\nBooker-Dwyer stated that rollout for the new Next Generation Science Standards for K-12 education, which has lessons in engineering, technology, earth and space sciences in addition to traditional sciences, was delayed by the pandemic. She remains optimistic that scores will improve as curriculum continues to change.\n\u201cI do believe it will get better as people are getting more and more comfortable with the science standards and more teachers are getting trained and the resources are getting better, as far as the instructional material,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said. \u201cBut initially it was tough.\u201d\nBooker-Dwyer discusses the need for a \u201csystems approach\u201d to address learning-loss in the school system, as learning is sequential. Students who aren\u2019t prepared with the foundations necessary for the new grade-level won\u2019t be able to pick up the curriculum as easily.\n\u201cWe have to look at this holistically. It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all approach to fixing this issue with our school systems,\u201d Booker-Dwyer said. \u201cThis is where I think the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future has some potential because it can give school systems some flexibility to get a little bit more innovative in how they\u2019re approaching the learning.\u201d\n\u201cBut the thing about it is you can only be as innovative as the state allows. And so until there\u2019s some major changes at the state level, we won\u2019t see those innovative schooling approaches happen at the school level,\u201d she said.\nThe 2024 MCAP tests are set to begin in the spring.",

    "content": "OCEAN CITY, Md. \u2013 As Maryland rolls out the 2021 landmark education reform law called the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, many school administrators are unsure what the plan means for their schools.\u00a0\nAt the annual School Leaders Conference held Nov. 2-4 in Ocean City, state officials and school principals reviewed the details of the Blueprint and discussed how it will be implemented in each school district.\nThe wave of impending policy changes are meant to address the challenges facing educators and students across the state. For example, Emily Abell, principal of Monarch Global Academy in Anne Arundel County, said her school is experiencing the effects of the nationwide teacher shortage.\u00a0\nAsked about the Blueprint, she said: \u201cIs it gonna help? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to see what it looks like on paper and when we start to implement.\u201d\n\n\nDownload the CNS app from the App Store or Google Play\n\nThe Blueprint is grounded in the analysis of a group of independent policy experts formed by the state in 2016 to establish a baseline for education reform. Though formally named the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, the group was commonly referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William E. Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland.\u00a0\nBy 2019, the Kirwan Commission had come to some sobering conclusions about Maryland\u2019s education system. Half of all teachers leave the profession within the first five years. Only two out of every five kindergarteners arrive in the classroom ready to learn. And just a third of students leave high school being \u201ccollege and career ready\u201d in English and math.\n\u201cThat was pre-pandemic. So generally speaking, it\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d said Rachel Hise, a policy specialist who worked for the state in tandem with the Kirwan Commission. Explaining the commission\u2019s findings to school leaders in Ocean City, she said the independent body concluded that \u201cultimately, the status quo is unsustainable.\u201d\nBecause of the work of the Kirwan Commission, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future in February 2021, overriding a veto by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who had cost concerns about the plan.\nThe Blueprint allocates $3.8 billion to schools over the next 10 years and is based on five \u201cpillars.\u201d\n\nPillar 1: Early Childhood Education, which includes the expansion of pre-K to three and four-year-olds through both public schools and private providers.\nPillar 2: High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders, which mandates raises in teacher salaries and incentivizes them to attain National Board Certification.\nPillar 3: College and Career Readiness, which establishes changes to high school curriculum, technical training programs and opportunities for apprenticeships.\nPillar 4: More Resources to Ensure that All Students are Successful, which provides more money to schools in need.\nPillar 5: Governance and Accountability, which creates a framework of oversight led by the Accountability and Implementation Board, the state agency created to administer the plan.\n\nHise is now executive director of the Blueprint\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board. She said the policy changes will make sure students are ready to learn in kindergarten and ready to succeed when they graduate high school.\n\u201cThe Blueprint is aiming to have all 4-year-olds in public full-day pre-K,\u201d said Hise.\u00a0\nBecause public schools lack the capacity to fulfill this mandate alone, the state will fund programming via private pre-K providers as well.\u00a0\n\u201cThe goal is a socioeconomically integrated pre-K system that is publicly funded, but that is provided by both public schools and private providers,\u201d Hise told administrators in Ocean City.\nThe Blueprint will also mean big changes in high schools.\n\u201cWhat the Blueprint really envisions is we want kids to be college and career ready by 10th grade, so that the second two years of high school students can focus on the pathway that they\u2019re interested in pursuing,\u201d Hise said.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint aims to meet this goal through curriculum changes in English and math in addition to apprenticeships and technical education programs.\nImplementing the Blueprint at the school level falls squarely on school administrators, said Addie Kaufman, executive director of the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals.\n\u201cThere was no doubt that the Blueprint would be a part of this conference, and the understanding of the Blueprint is actually key,\u201d she said in an interview.\nAfter learning more about the Blueprint at the conference, some principals said they are hopeful that the reforms will address their schools\u2019 priorities.\nTeachers are struggling to make do with salaries in the current economy, said Principal Ryan Daniel of Fort Foote Elementary in Prince George\u2019s County.\u00a0\n\u201cI know a lot of my teachers have to have after-school jobs or second jobs to compensate for their salary,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nThe Blueprint will raise the minimum salary for teachers to $60,000 across the state by 2026. And if teachers obtain National Board Certification, the Blueprint allows them to earn up to an additional $17,000 per year.\n\u201cI am excited for the Blueprint for Maryland,\u201d said Sarah Bento, an assistant principal at Northern High School in Calvert County. \u201cThe Blueprint is really asking us to rethink what high school looks like and really make sure that we\u2019re preparing all of our students to be prepared to go to college or enter the workforce in a way that we just haven\u2019t done before.\u201d\u00a0\nThanks to the Blueprint, Bento\u2019s school has been able to hire a career advisor for the first time.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have 1,500 students and he\u2019s meeting with every single one of them to talk about career entrance and get them connected to the resources that are out there,\u201d she told the Local News Network.\u00a0\nOther schools have yet to feel the concrete impact of the Blueprint.\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still reading and learning, and I think that they\u2019re doing a really slow roll out intentionally for us, which is good,\u201d said Jamie Miller, the principal at Broadneck Elementary in Arnold, in Anne Arundel County. \u201cWe have people at the board level who are becoming sort of experts and then they\u2019re going to disseminate to us.\u201d\u00a0\nMiller expressed a mix of excitement about the expansion of pre-K and trepidation about her school\u2019s capacity to meet the need.\n\u201cI would love to have pre-K in our school,\u201d she said. \u201cEarly childhood is a love of mine, so I would love to. But our school building is very, very old and there\u2019s not a place for them.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s hard to implement policy changes while running the day-to-day operations of a school, said Miller.\u00a0\n\u201cSo I think the summertime will be a big focus for us when there aren\u2019t kids in the building and we\u2019ll be able to kind of digest it more and be taught exactly what the expectations are,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m eager to see how it all rolls out.\u201d\u00a0\nIn March 2023, every school district submitted a detailed plan to the Accountability and Implementation Board for rolling out the Blueprint in their schools.\u00a0\n\u201cThe plans are fine, but they really are a baseline,\u201d Hise, of the Accountability and Implementation Board, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for more innovative thinking.\u201d\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board expects updated plans from every district in March 2024, and has offered every district a $100,000 grant to hire a strategic planning expert. All but Frederick and Worcester counties took the state up on that deal.\nThe Local News Network will follow the Blueprint rollout and an analysis of each district-level plan will be published in January on the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service website.",

At Maryland\u2019s six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs \u2013 University of Maryland, Baltimore County; University of Maryland, College Park; Towson University; Frostburg State University; Salisbury University and St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland\u2013 less than 6% of the total faculty are Black and less than 5% are Hispanic, as of 2021.\n\nAccording to Laura Perna, Vice Provost for Faculty at University of Pennsylvania and a researcher on college access, faculty underrepresentation is a widespread issue, though the specifics differ by university.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross Maryland, faculty demographics vary widely. At Towson University, 7% of faculty were Black in fall 2021 and 3% were Hispanic. At Frostburg State University, those numbers were about halved, with 4% Black faculty and almost 1% Hispanic faculty.\u00a0\nPrior to 2022, Maryland\u2019s education code allowed individual public universities to implement their own plans for \u201ccultural diversity,\u201d which ranged in length and breadth. In 2022, a new code was instituted, requiring public universities to ensure that faculty, staff, and administration demographics reflect the state\u2019s diverse population.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, the percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty at the universities included in the analysis both increased by just under a percentage point.\u00a0\n\u201cIt really is amazing how little progress there has been in some ways on this,\u201d said Perna.\nBut not unexpected, according to Perna. Because positions open when current faculty members retire, seeing an increase in representation might take time.\u00a0\nAccording to Dr. Kimberly Griffin, Dean of University of Maryland\u2019s College of Education, many people assume that faculty will diversify alongside the student body. This \u201ctrickle up\u201d system is unrealistic, she says.\u00a0\nThe problem is multifaceted, says Griffin. Academia is tasked with generating a pool, hiring inclusively, yielding candidates, onboarding hirees, retaining them, and ultimately, promoting them. \u201cWe have to do more in all of those spaces,\u201d says Griffin, whose research has, for years, focused on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in post-secondary education.\u00a0\nAccording to Perna, one roadblock is \u201cinvisible labor\u201d; faculty of color often take on work that requires time and energy, but does not fit academia\u2019s standard promotion metrics.\u00a0\n\u201cWe should be looking at to what extent our definition of merit is very narrow,\u201d said Perna. \nUnderrepresented minorities often spend more time serving on committees and mentoring students of color, labor that often goes unrecognized, says Perna. Come time for promotions, publications and course evaluations are weighted more heavily.\u00a0\nResearch may also go unappreciated. According to Griffin, members of minority groups often pursue research in applied topics, like solutions to community issues.\n\u201cBias that we have around what good work looks like, and what\u2019s meaningful can shape how the tenure and promotion cases of women and men of color are perceived,\u201d Griffin says.\u00a0\nAs the student body has diversified, the gap between representation among students and faculty has widened, straining faculty of color.\u00a0\nAs of fall 2021, Black students made up 17% and Hispanic students made up 8% of the student body at the universities included in the CNS analysis. That was an increase of 10% and 19% since 2016, respectively. Faculty demographics remained stable.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021, the resulting ratio of Black students to Black faculty members was 60:1. The ratio of white students to white faculty members was 15:1.\nAccording to Griffin, while it\u2019s crucial for students of color to have role models and mentors of color, there isn\u2019t enough faculty of color to shoulder that responsibility alone. \u201cThat\u2019s a load everyone should share,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nA lack of diversity also impacts faculty of color pursuing tenure. At Maryland\u2019s six largest in-person public universities, not including HBCUs,\u00a0 in 2021, 71% of tenured professors were white, 5% Black, and 4% were Hispanic, according to IPEDS.\u00a0\n\nAcross all six universities in 2021, there were 104 tenured Black professors, an increase of 3 professors from 2016, according to IPEDS. There were 10 more Black faculty members and 16 more Hispanic faculty members in tenure track positions than in 2016.\u00a0\nA lack of diversity among tenured faculty can make it harder for some faculty of color to find mentors as they pursue tenure, though many members of academia, like Griffin, are trying to combat this by developing intentional mentoring policy.\n\u201cMentorship that helps you build a sense of connection and community in your unit and in your college is also really important for helping folks get to tenure,\u201d said Griffin.\u00a0\nTenure and tenure track positions provide more job security than other faculty roles. In Maryland in 2021, 38% of Hispanic faculty and 30% of Black faculty were not tenured or on tenure track compared to 27% of white faculty.\u00a0\nKatharina Maisel, a bioengineering professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, co-authored a list of best practices for increasing diversity alongside several other faculty members in the STEM field.\u00a0\nAccording to Maisel, diversifying the faculty, especially tenure and tenure track, takes intention at every stage of the process, from inviting people to apply, inviting people for internships, and checking your shortlist to make sure you\u2019re not just inviting people from Ivy League schools.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s possible.\u00a0\nIn science, technology, engineering, and math, says Maisel, a tendency to be overspecific in job listings can discourage faculty from underrepresented backgrounds. Being more broad can cut through imposter syndrome and help develop a wider applicant pool.\nUsing rubrics to evaluate a candidate for hiring or promotion can help ensure an objective set of criteria, helping reel in internal biases, Maisel said.\n\u201cIf you as a department are really actively interested in increasing the diversity of your faculty, there are things you can do,\u201d Maisel said.",

    "summary": "In Carroll County, 56 books were temporarily removed from school libraries following complaints about inappropriate content, with a majority written by female, LGBTQIA+, and non-binary authors featuring diverse characters. The challenges, led by conservative group Moms for Liberty, focused on what they deemed as \"graphic sex\" content, aiming to address concerns related to the mental health crisis among youth.",
    "content": "Last month, Carroll County\u2019s Board of Education temporarily removed 56 books from the district\u2019s school libraries after complaints about inappropriate content. An analysis by Capital News Service (CNS) found that a high proportion of the titles being reviewed were written by female, LGBTQIA+ and non-binary authors and featured LGBTQIA+ characters and characters of color.\nCNS collected data about the authors and content of the 56 books being challenged from author websites, publisher websites, book synopsis and other online sources.\nThere are 43 different authors of the 56 books being challenged. The data collected by CNS shows a majority, 67%, of the authors are female. Despite only accounting for less than 2% of U.S. adults according to Pew Research Center survey data, non-binary authors make up 12% of the book authors.\n\n\n\nLGBTQIA+ writers and illustrators make up 28%, despite the LGBTQIA+ community representing only about 7% of the U.S. adult population, according to Pew Research Center.\nMany of the titles up for review also include diverse characters.\nAccording to the CNS analysis, of the 56 books temporarily removed, at least 25 contain LGBTQIA+ characters and at least 16 include characters of color.\n\n\n\nThe challenges were driven by Moms for Liberty, a conservative group focusing on parents\u2019 rights that, according to The Washington Post, has been responsible for a surge of book challenges across the United States in recent years.\nMoms for Liberty\u2019s Carroll County Chair, and mother of five, Kit Hart has attended various school board meetings to speak about the issue of having books in school libraries that have what the group deemed \u201cgraphic sex\u201d content.\n\u201cThe only criteria that we used to identify these books was that they contained very graphic sex or rape, that was the only criteria that we use, it wasn\u2019t anything else,\u201d Hart said.\nHart said there is already a mental health crisis in the U.S. and the group wants to help identify some of the factors which could be contributing.\n\u00a0\u201cWe believe that this type of material can be very upsetting and problematic to students, and it\u2019s not developing any kind of literacy that they need, and it can really damage their mental health,\u201d Hart said.\nMoms for Liberty points to the website BookLooks.org when evaluating books. It provides detailed reports of what they consider objectionable content and ratings for specific books. Some of the concerns listed in the reports include \u201calternate sexualities\u201d and \u201calternate gender ideologies.\u201d\nBookLooks also lists various types of \u201ccontroversial commentary\u201d that they believe children and young adults shouldn\u2019t have access to, including themes about race, culture, politics, religion, abortion and more.\n\n\n\nOut of the challenged books, 28% contain LGBTQIA+ themes, and 14% include non-binary themes, according to BookLooks.\nA book that discusses both sexuality and gender ideology is \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d by George M. Johnson, who is a queer Black man. He wrote a series of essays about his \u201ctrials and triumphs\u201d growing up in New Jersey and Virginia. With 86 challenges, it was the second-most challenged book in the country in 2022, according to the American Library Association (ALA).\nSome parents, like Carroll County resident and mom of two Pamela Hohlbein, worry the removal would result in children having limited access to diverse voices and perspectives.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bAt the end of the day, these book bans are affecting kids, who are not really kids anymore. They\u2019re teenagers, they\u2019re young adults. They need to learn about the world, not just this little Carroll County bubble that everyone seems to think is protecting the kids,\u201d said Hohlbein. \u201cBut when they get off into the real world, and they don\u2019t know about other cultures, and they don\u2019t know how to interact with the LGBTQ community or the BIPOC community, it\u2019s really going to harm them in the long run.\u201d\nHart said she agrees that students should be exposed to different people, cultures and lifestyles in their reading but does not see why sexual content has to be included in some works.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t include that sexual content in the books. \u2026 They should be able to be exposed to all different kinds of people without being exposed to sexual content at the same time,\u201d Hart said.\nAccording to BookLooks, some 96% of the books challenged in Carroll County include forms of sexual content, with 38% discussing sexual assault.\nOne of these books being flagged for containing sexual assault is \u201cA Stolen Life: A Memoir\u201d by Jaycee Lee Dugard, who wrote about her experience of abuse and survival after being kidnapped and held in captivity for 18 years.\nWendy Novak, a Carroll County resident and mom of three, said that books writt\u200b\u200ben by survivors of sexual assault about their experiences helped her understand what her own child went through, which she also spoke about at the September Board of Education meeting.\n\u201cI have a 25-year-old that was sexually assaulted, and for me, and I know it\u2019s true for other people, reading books by survivors helps to understand what my child went through,\u201d Novak said. \u201cThese books are available in high schools. They\u2019re not available in middle or elementary schools, but they\u2019re available at the age range that is unfortunately very likely to be assaulted.\u201d\nSome members of the Carroll County Public School\u2019s Board of Education have expressed support for the removal of the books.\nCarroll County Board of Education members Steve Whisler and Tara Battaglia both signed Moms For Liberty\u2019s \u201cParent Pledge,\u201d which states that they will \u201chonor the fundamental rights of parents including but not limited to the right to direct the education, medical care, and moral upbringing of their children.\u201d\nWhisler was also a speaker at Moms for Liberty\u2019s \u201cGiving Parents a Voice Townhall\u201d held in Silver Spring on Sept. 26, where he spoke about how much he values parental involvement.\nThe issue of book challenges exists beyond Carroll County. According to national data collected by the ALA\u2019s Office for Intellectual Freedom, in the first 8 months of 2023, 1,915 unique titles were targeted.\n\n\n\nAccording to the ALA, the number of unique titles challenged has increased by 20% this year from the same reporting period in 2022, which saw the highest number of challenges since the ALA started collecting the data 20 years ago.\nThe ALA found the recent rise in title challenges is often driven by a single person or group challenging multiple titles at a time.\nIn the first eight months of 2023, 11 states reported cases of a challenge to\u202f100 or more books, compared to six during the same reporting period in 2022 and zero in 2021, and that \u201c9 in 10 of the overall number of books challenged were part of an attempt to censor multiple titles,\u201d according to the ALA.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely the challenges will slow down soon. In nearby Harford County, Board of Education Vice President Melissa Hahn called out six books for being inappropriate for students at a recent board meeting.\nIn Carroll County, the school district\u2019s reconsideration committee will continue to review up to five books per month. According to The Baltimore Sun, school officials have decided to retain five of the books in high school libraries, including \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d by Stephen Chbosky, \u201cTilt\u201d by Ellen Hopkins, \u201cThe Sun and her Flowers\u201d by Rupi Kaur, \u201cNot that Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture\u201d by Roxane Gay, and \u201cSlaughterhouse Five\u201d by Kurt Vonnegut, though the books have not yet been returned to shelves as the decision is open to appeal. \u201cSlaughterhouse Five,\u201d an anti-war novel long considered a classic of American literature, has been permanently removed from middle school libraries in the county.\nDylan Manfre contributed to this story",

    "content": "LARGO, Md. \u2013 U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg presented grants to two Maryland community colleges Wednesday to help cover tuition in their commercial driver\u2019s license programs.\u00a0\nPrince George\u2019s County Community College and Community College of Baltimore County received $173,640 and $197,410 respectively, to help with the cost of tuition for veterans, refugees and the underserved. Gov. Wes Moore and staff from both schools attended the event in a PGCC parking lot.\n\u201cBefore the infrastructure law passed, even if the school qualified for these grants, students would still have to cover a lot of the tuition. Here at Prince George\u2019s, that comes roughly to about $4,000,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cWe\u2019re tearing down that barrier with federal funding so that they can get funded to come to an excellent institution like this.\u201d\nThe Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation is part of an ongoing effort to expand job opportunities within the trucking industry. This assistance is available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Buttigieg said. The law, officially known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, provides resources to fix decaying roads, bridges, waterways and rails, and boosts transit projects, broadband access and climate change resilience, among other things.\u00a0\nA commercial driver\u2019s license is required to operate large vehicles, including school buses, large delivery trucks, shuttles and tractor trailers, among others.\u00a0\n\u201cWe believe in veterans, and we believe in the importance of trucking, for the country, for our economic security, and for our future,\u201d said Buttigieg. \u201cYou in Maryland have a governor who understands the importance of infrastructure and of transportation in people\u2019s everyday lives.\u201d\nBoth Buttigieg and Moore are veterans \u2013 Buttigieg was a naval officer and Moore served in the Army \u2013 and both were Rhodes scholars. The two announced in January a project to rebuild the 150-year-old B&P Tunnel in Baltimore, renaming it the Frederick Douglass Tunnel.\u00a0\nJames Brackins, 70, a recent graduate of the Commercial Driver\u2019s License program and an Army veteran, introduced Buttigieg to the crowd of under 100. Brackins joined the program as a part of his goal to build affordable housing in his hometown of Jonesville, Louisiana.\u00a0\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m one step closer to achieving that goal,\u201d said Brackins.\u201c It gives me great joy to know that others will be supported in their dreams, just as I have been supported thanks to PGCC.\u201d\nMoore and Buttigieg greeted staff and the CDL instructors and toured the commercial tractor trailers used in the program. PGCC partners with Mr. George\u2019s Driving School of Gaithersburg, which provides instructors and equipment for training.\u00a0\nAt one point, Moore hopped in the passenger seat of a commercial tractor trailer to ride along with a demonstration of driving through the parking lot and backing up between cones.\u00a0\nGov. Wes Moore rides with Prince George\u2019s County Community College commercial driving school student Carlos Sanchez Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023. (Capital News Service/Tommy Tucker)\nMoore praised PGCC, mentioning his visit a few weeks prior with President Joe Biden to the campus.\u00a0\n\u201cIt says so much about this administration that just weeks after the president came to Prince George\u2019s County Community College, that Secretary Buttigieg is here again as well,\u201d said Moore.\u00a0\nCommunity colleges are an important area for Moore because he attended a two-year college, receiving an associate degree from Valley Forge Military College. In his speech, Moore said his junior college experience was the foundation of his career.\n\u201cOur support for community colleges is not just everlasting, it\u2019s personal,\u201d said Moore.\u00a0\nIn 2023, PGCC\u2019s transportation, distribution and logistics departments trained more than 500 students and it has enrolled more than 300 more since July.\n\u201cMuch like the Department of Transportation, we, too, are committed to the mission of providing safe, efficient, sustainable and equitable commerce in our community,\u201d said Sherrie Johnson, vice president of external affairs, communications, and advancement at PGCC.\nButtigieg has been in Maryland since his Impact Maryland forum Tuesday, sponsored by The Baltimore Banner, where he addressed electric vehicles and transit infrastructure. During that event, the secretary was forced off the stage by climate protesters critical of a planned oil export facility near Houston.",

    "summary": "Charles County, along with nine other Maryland school districts, has sued major social media companies for allegedly targeting and manipulating youth, leading to classroom distractions and mental health issues. Teachers report that students are increasingly distracted by social media, lacking self-control and struggling with emotional expression, making it difficult to engage them in learning.",
    "content": "A \u201cboring and pointless\u201d education.\nThat\u2019s what students at Henry E. Lackey High School in Indian Head, in Charles County, tell their English teacher Nicholas Gray they\u2019re receiving while they distract themselves with TikTok videos, \u201csnaps\u201d on Snapchat, and endless\u00a0scrolls through Instagram during class.\n\u201cIt is difficult to convince [students] that learning is more impactful and important than the brand new video that will entertain them,\u201d Gray said.\nWith that thought in mind, Charles County this month joined nine other Maryland school districts in a lawsuit against the world\u2019s social media giants: Google, Meta, ByteDance and Snap Inc. Other school districts in the state that have joined the court action are Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s and Talbot.\n\u201cHopefully this lawsuit provides pressure for some action in terms of how to better create products that are geared to children,\u201d said Maria Navarro, superintendent of Charles County Public Schools.\nA classroom distraction\nThe lawsuit accused several social media platforms of targeting and manipulating youth so they stay engaged for excessive amounts of time \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what educators see in Charles County classrooms.\n\u201c(Social media is) a huge distraction in our schools and in our classrooms,\u201d said Cheryl Davis, principal of Henry E. Lackey High School.\nThe teachers do their part to plan effective, instructional uses for technology in the classroom, Davis said, but personal devices get in the way.\nGray said he prohibits the use of cell phones during instructional times and tries to create engaging lessons so that students will not be tempted to use their devices or go on social media. However, he said, the biggest problem plaguing his students is self control and their failure to regulate personal behavior.\n\u201cStudents are lacking the ability to express their emotions in a positive way,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe see a lot more negative expressions.\u201d\nStudents have gotten more angry and aggressive, Davis said. In a developmental part of their lives, they often fail to pause for a moment and look for resources or constructive ways to express their emotions.\n\u201cThere is no respite,\u201d Gray said. \u201cStudents leave for the day and the talking/anger continues onto Instagram or Snapchat, and then the students come to school upset over what is on social media.\u201d\nSeveral Charles County educators said more physical altercations have occurred because of social media conflicts.\n\u201cSnapchat scares me,\u201d said Brian Street, a father of two Piccowaxen middle schoolers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several fights at school on Snapchat.\u201d\nOn top of that, two staff members at St. Charles High School were injured Thursday after they intervened in a physical altercation between students that started over a social media post, according to a letter that Principal Tammika Little sent out to parents.\n\u201cPlease monitor your child\u2019s electronic devices and social media accounts,\u201d Little said.\nThe mental health impact\nNot surprisingly, school officials in Charles County and elsewhere are alarmed at how social media affects child development and mental health. \u00a0That concern is also reflected in the lawsuit, which alleges that companies are aware of the negative impacts the platforms have on children\u2019s mental health, but they choose to prioritize profit.\nStudents go through developmental changes from elementary school to middle school, where their focus shifts from their parents to their peer group. Navarro said this is when children start pushing their own boundaries and understanding how to become an adult.\nAs students become more self-sufficient, they begin building confidence \u2013 but social media usage during this stage can interrupt a child\u2019s growth, Navarro said.\n\u201cA fake reality, at those pivotal developmental ages, has more of an impact on behavioral health,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIt also isolates you.\u201d\nNavarro said social media augments the insecurities children face at pivotal ages, and research seems to prove that point. Researchers at Facebook found that Instagram, in 2021, made one in three girls feel worse about their bodies, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic further isolated children and left many in a more fragile mental state. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2021, suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14.\nCharles County educators said social media contributes to the mental health crises that some young people endure. Inappropriate social media interactions continue to create disruptions in the buildings all over the county because children these ages are not developmentally ready for the responsibility, Davis said.\n\u201cStudents lack the maturity to be able to handle social media,\u201d Davis said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u00a0\nThat being the case, Davis said schools must make mental health a priority or else their true purpose will not be achieved.\n\u201cWe are here to educate students,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf students are not in the right mindset, then it\u2019s much more difficult for them to access education.\u201d\nSearching for solutions\nWhile voicing support for the lawsuit, Charles County educators are looking elsewhere for more prompt solutions to the problems social media causes in the classroom.\nDavis pushed for parents to be a part of the solution.\n\u201cYou pay for the phone, you own the phone, put some apps on there that allow you to control access,\u201d Davis said.\nParents should be monitoring their kids\u2019 devices to make sure they\u2019re safe, Davis said, and it is not just her who feels this way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a school thing, it\u2019s a parent thing,\u201d Street said.\nHe said that while he does monitor his kids\u2019 social media usage, it is a parents\u2019 decision on how active they want to be in controlling it.\nNavarro said CCPS has many resources for parents to learn how to be tech savvy so they know how to keep their children safe. In addition to limiting screen time, she said parents should be encouraging their kids to physically play, talk and participate in sports and extracurricular activities with other kids.\nNavarro said when to allow children to have devices is a parent\u2019s choice.\n\u201cMy job is to inform and educate them about the implications of those decisions,\u201d Navarro said. She said she wants students to reach their full potential, but right now social media makes it harder for them to do that.\nThat\u2019s where the lawsuit could help.\nNavarro said that if the district gets any compensation from this lawsuit, the school system intends to expand resources for the growing needs of behavioral health.\nAnd even in these early stages, Navarro said, the lawsuit serves an important purpose.\n\u201cIt sends a message,\u201d she said.\nThe message: that everyone \u2013 from social media companies to educators to parents to students \u2013 must be alert to the harm that social media can do to young people.",

    "summary": "Audits in Maryland have uncovered significant issues with school district contracting, including a case where over $320,000 was stolen through misuse of purchasing cards and mismanagement of bus contracts. Despite regular audits, many districts fail to implement recommended solutions, leading to repeated findings of financial mismanagement.",
    "content": "Auditors keep a close eye on school district contracting in Maryland \u2014 and if you\u2019re wondering why, just look at what happened in May in Montgomery County.\nAfter auditors raised suspicions, the district\u2019s former assistant director of transportation pleaded guilty to stealing over $320,000 from the county\u2019s school system over a span of at least five years by misusing district purchasing cards and mismanaging a contract for the purchase of school buses.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, several state audits in recent years raised serious questions about contract spending in other Maryland public school districts. Richard P. Henry, Maryland\u2019s inspector general for education, acknowledged the possibility that officials in other school districts could be misusing the school contracting system.\n\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t find out all the time, but there will always be some individuals who will take advantage of flaws in the system, and you know, possibly profit from it or use it to their advantage,\u201d Henry said.\nCounty or district officials frequently audit local school districts in Maryland. On top of that, the state Office of Legislative Audits reviews the books of each school district once every six years, whereas the Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education takes complaints from the public and investigates them.\nBut audits, while helpful, can only identify problems. It is up to the districts to implement solutions \u2014 and often they don\u2019t. The Office of Legislative Audits released an audit of the Maryland State Department of Education in January. Auditors found 171 repeated findings that local school systems had yet to address from previous audits.\u00a0\nThat audit recommended the Department of Education establish a monitoring process. The department agreed to assess whether it\u2019s feasible to require school districts to issue progress reports that track whether they are following their auditors\u2019 recommendations.\nMatthew Streett, assistant director of the Compliance and Performance Audit Division in the Office of Legislative Audits, said school districts should take audit findings seriously.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to safeguard the assets because ultimately, when you\u2019re talking about money that flows through the school system, it\u2019s all intended to help educate the students, and if money is being diverted, it\u2019s less money that\u2019s intended for the classroom and students,\u201d Streett said.\nPublic school districts in Montgomery County, Baltimore City, Howard County, Charles County and Calvert County have all been audited in recent years. Concerns raised in those audits range from unauthorized transactions to insufficient documentation to justify major purchases.\nIn addition, the audits found that nearly every school district failed to complete proper documentation for approval of intergovernmental purchasing agreements. In many cases, employees made purchases without documenting why they were necessary and beneficial to the district.\nHere\u2019s a detailed look at what auditors and investigators found in recent years in those individual school districts:\nMontgomery County\nAuditors have found a number of issues with school district contracting in Montgomery County, but none more serious than the one that led to guilty pleas from two district transportation department officials this year.\nIn May, Charles Ewald, the district\u2019s former assistant transportation director, pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft and one misdemeanor count of misconduct in office.\u00a0\nCourt records said Ewald used his position to request checks from an \u201coff-the-books\u201d account held by one of the district\u2019s longtime bus vendors, American Truck & Bus Inc. The money came from late fee and change fee reimbursements owed to the district \u2014 and, according to court documents, $352,568.68 of it went directly to Ewald\u2019s bank account. In addition, Ewald had the bus vendor issue about $16,000 in checks to other school district staff members.\nTodd Watkins, the former director of the transportation department, pleaded guilty in June to one count of misconduct in office, and not just because he failed to fulfill his role of overseeing the department\u2019s expenses. Watkins was the one who coordinated with American Truck & Bus to establish the \u201coff-the-books\u201d account, court records said.\nWatkins received over $13,000 using the account and intentionally violated the district\u2019s reimbursement policy, but he provided documentation for those payments and was not charged with theft.\u00a0\nA judge will sentence Ewald and Watkins in September, closing a criminal case that began with an internal review in 2021.\nThen last December, the Montgomery County Office of the Inspector General found that school district transportation department officials used school funds to pay for a NASCAR headset, drag racing tires, a sport loop band for an Apple Watch, a car roof rack for kayaks, Home Depot and Amazon gift cards, along with other personal items. The purchases totaled nearly $5,000.\nAlso late last year, the state Office of Legislative Audits weighed in with its look at how Montgomery County Public Schools do business, finding other concerns far beyond the district\u2019s transportation department.\nFor example, auditors found the county failed to complete state-mandated written assessments for three intergovernmental contract agreements worth a combined $20.9 million. District officials did not make sure the invoice pricing matched the agreed contract; instead, they relied on informal proposals and internet searches to determine whether they were getting the right prices.\nAuditors also found several problems with district construction contracts:\n\nThe district was missing critical documentation to justify their award of five contracts valued at over $150 million. This included information on losing bidders, selection criteria and evidence of selection committee evaluations.\nSchool officials took no consideration of price, as required by law, in selecting some contracts. District officials awarded the contract without documenting how they agreed upon the prices.\nEight procurements valued at $190 million were never put up for bid on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage, despite the law requiring any procurement or award over $50,000 to be published and put up for competitive bidding.\nOn the construction sites themselves, school district officials repeatedly neglected to complete daily inspections to make sure the work was being done correctly on eight contracts totaling $181.8 million.\n\nIn response to the audit, Montgomery County Public Schools officials confirmed all the findings were factually accurate and outlined procedures they planned to implement to correct the problems.\nBaltimore City\nThe Maryland Office of the Inspector General for Education reported in May that Baltimore City schools overpaid taxi vendors by more than $695,000.\nThe district contracted taxis to transport students with extenuating circumstances, such as those with disabilities, in foster care, or who lack safe walking or bus routes to school.\u00a0\nDistrict officials approved billing based on a voucher system that required a signature from the taxi driver and the student (or their guardian) upon completion of the ride. However, according to the investigation, some taxi drivers forged vouchers to bill the district for rides that never happened.\nThe bulk of those overcharges involved the city\u2019s Yellow Cab Co. and the company that bought it in 2021, zTrip. Yellow Cab filed vouchers totaling $512,990.42 in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years that were not supported by student attendance records, the audit said. zTrip acquired Yellow Cab in September 2021, and the audit said the company had another $118,556.72 in unsupported voucher claims in the 2021-2022 school year.\nAuditors found several instances of billed rides from Yellow Cab and zTrip that did not match student attendance records. For example, in one case, there were 18 roundtrips recorded for a student during February 2022. Yet attendance records showed the student only attended school nine times that month.\nThe investigation also found transportation charges for students that were no longer attending Baltimore City schools. Between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years, there were filings for a total of 25 students after they transferred schools or withdrew from the district. Additionally, 46 high school seniors were named on vouchers in June despite graduating in May.\nThe other four cab vendors servicing the district collectively accounted for a little over $64,000 of the total discrepancies, which auditors said did not warrant further investigation.\nSonja B. Santelises, CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools, wrote a letter responding to the audit. She noted the district\u2019s taxi ridership decreased by 90% for the 2022-2023 school year compared to 2018-2019, serving fewer than 100 students, which allowed for closer monitoring and fewer discrepancies.\nSantelises argued the district is not the only one to blame.\n\u201cCity Schools has prioritized increasing our oversight of transportation vendors in recent years, despite the state\u2019s long-standing and well-documented legacy of systemic underfunding and the resulting limited resources for additional monitoring,\u201d she wrote.\nHoward County\nThe state Office of Legislative Audits, in a report issued in April, found the Howard County Public School System has significantly improved its financial oversight but auditors have concerns over the district\u2019s procurement practices, contract bids, and processes for monitoring payments for transportation and health care.\nThe prior audit, conducted in 2016, found issues ranging from unreported salaries to incomplete inventories of technology equipment. Since then, auditors said, Howard County has successfully addressed six of the eight issues found.\nDespite the county\u2019s progress, the most recent audit highlighted a few problem areas.\nThe county violated state law by failing to publish some contract bids and awards on eMaryland Marketplace Advantage. The Office of Legislative Audits tested 10 contracts totaling $35.7 million and four of those contracts totaling $18.7 million were never published. Therefore, the county did not give other contractors the opportunity to bid in those instances.\nThe district failed to audit the third-party administrator that made health care payments on the district\u2019s behalf. As a result, district officials can\u2019t be sure whether care was actually administered and billed accurately, auditors said.\nThe audit does not identify that third-party administrator, but in an email to the Local News Network, a district spokesman identified the company that managed the district\u2019s health care programs at the time as Kelly & Associates Insurance Group. The district paid $746.5 million over those four years to Kelly, making it one of the highest-paid school district contractors in the state.\nCharles County\nState auditors reported in January that Charles County school officials don\u2019t adequately supervise the use of district-issued credit cards.\nThey issued the cards to departments and schools with credit limits ranging from $1,000 to $50,000. The transactions on these cards totaled $687,000 in fiscal year 2021.\nSince multiple employees have access to each card, it is difficult to determine who is responsible for any fraudulent charges, auditors said.\nIn addition, supervisors are not using Level-3 data to analyze transaction logs. Level-3 data are detailed descriptions of purchases provided by merchants, which would make it easier to identify suspicious charges.\nCharles County school officials also could not produce a reasonable justification for why they spent $6 million for bus maintenance costs in fiscal year 2019.\nThe district agreed that all the audit\u2019s findings were factually accurate. However, district officials noted risk-reducing procedures they have in place for credit cards and included a more detailed cost breakdown of bus vendor fees.\nCalvert County\nThe state Office of Legislative Audits reported in January 2022 that Calvert County Public Schools took shortcuts in the spending approval process and failed to monitor whether their vendors were billing them correctly.\nThe lack of oversight on the district\u2019s financial systems also allowed individual departments and schools to make purchases while skipping necessary procurement processes, auditors said.\nAuditors also raised questions about the district\u2019s transportation costs. Compared to other comparable-sized districts, Calvert County schools paid 22 cents per mile more for transportation.\nIn addition, the district also paid over a half-million dollars in bus operations fees without providing any reasonable justification for these transportation costs.\nOn other contracts, the district didn\u2019t check to see if the price written on the invoice from vendors matched the pricing agreed to in the contract. The audit found five payments in intergovernmental contract agreements that added up to $642,000 that were vaguely detailed or had different product descriptions.\nThe district also allowed a third party to pay out medical claims without ever ensuring the services were provided and appropriately priced.\nCalvert County Public Schools accepted the audit results and said it would address the issues.",

    "content": "Billions of local, state and federal tax dollars go to funding Maryland\u2019s public schools every year \u2014 and now, it will be easier for you to find out how your local school district spent that money.\nThat\u2019s because the Local News Network at the University of Maryland has published an easily searchable database where you can look up your school district\u2019s vendor payments over the past four years.\u00a0\nThat database and an accompanying series of stories comprise \u201cContracted Out,\u201d a project compiled over the past seven months by students and faculty at the UMD Philip Merrill College of Journalism. The \u201cContracted Out\u201d database provides a comprehensive and unprecedented itemization of school contract spending statewide.\n\u201cIf there is any corruption out there, it\u2019s through these contracts,\u201d said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\n\u201cContracted Out\u201d gives local journalists and the general public something they\u2019ve never had before: an easy way to review school district vendor payments.\nThe \u201cContracted Out\u201d database contains information from all 24 public school districts in Maryland, with the ability to break out individual districts. The database includes every vendor that was paid over $25,000 by each district between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.\nThe Local News Network turned more than 26,000 rows of raw data into news the public can use. School district payments for health insurance, buses, computers and meals \u2014 it\u2019s all there.\nStill, there are limits to the data:\n\nVendor payments account for only a small portion of school funding in Maryland or any other state. Roza said the vast majority of school spending \u2014 80% to 90% of it \u2014 goes to teacher and staff salaries, not vendors.\nThe data used to construct the \u201cContracted Out\u201d database \u2014 most of it obtained through the state\u2019s Open Data Portal \u2014 lacks detail. Most districts only have to report payments of more than $25,000, the name of the vendor and the zip code where the vendor is based. A quirk in state law\u00a0requires only Baltimore County Public Schools to say why they spent what they spent.\nSchool districts have differing policies regarding which services they contract out and which they handle in-house. For example, some districts have their own bus fleets while others hire contractors to transport students.\u00a0\nDistricts also disagree on what constitutes a vendor payment. Most notably, some list state and federal taxes as vendor payments, but others exclude them from the data. For that reason, any district-by-district comparison of overall vendor payments would not be statistically valid.\n\nEven so, the data that\u2019s online serves a useful purpose, said Matthew Streett, assistant director in the state\u2019s Office of Legislative Audits.\n\u201cI look at it from a transparency and accountability standpoint,\u201d Streett said. \u201cThe public wants to know where their taxpayer dollars are going when it comes to educating students.\u201d\nStreett\u2019s office routinely audits school district spending, as do district officials and inspector general offices in individual counties. Meanwhile, the Office of the State Inspector General for Education performs audits based on tips about possible wrongdoing. You can find details about some of the recent audits here.\nThose audits can spot big trouble. For example, an internal review of contracting in Montgomery County Public Schools last year found evidence of irregularities in the district\u2019s transportation department. A criminal investigation then led to a guilty plea to a felony theft charge by the department\u2019s former assistant director, as well as a guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge by the department\u2019s former director.\nBut the checks and balances on school spending don\u2019t depend primarily on auditors and investigators. School boards review and authorize vendor payments, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\n\u201cMaryland procurement laws apply to school districts,\u201d he said. \u201cSchool districts can\u2019t go out and stroke a million-dollar check to a vendor without going through a bid process.\u201d\nBut Roza said school boards rarely go over vendor contracts line by line.\u00a0\n\u201cThey end up going into a consent agenda, and the whole board goes, \u2018Everybody want to approve the 91 contracts that we have coming before the board this month? All in favor? Aye,\u2019\u201d she said.\nIn most states, those contracts are published only in a school board\u2019s minutes, not online like in Maryland, Roza said.\nBut the Local News Network found big problems with the school contracting data on the state\u2019s Open Data Portal.\u00a0\nWhen work on the project began in January, huge chunks of data from four of the five largest school districts in the state were missing. Data was missing from several smaller districts, too \u2014 even though a 2019 act of the General Assembly requires districts to report vendor payments of over $25,000 with the Department of Budget and Management.\nStudent journalists and Local News Network Director Jerry Zremski spent months prodding districts to comply with the law and provide the missing data. The last to do so, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, didn\u2019t do that until early June.\nDerek Willis, lecturer in computational and data journalism at Merrill College, then completed the work his students had begun: cleaning up the data so that every vendor was listed by the same name.\nA team of 38 student journalists reviewed the incomplete data before the spring semester ended and Zremski studied the late-arriving data.\u00a0\nTheir key findings will be included in the accompanying stories, but local journalists around the state and citizens may also want to take a close look at the data. As Roza noted, the people closest to the local school districts \u2014 reporters and citizens who live in those districts \u2014 will be the ones most likely to spot questionable vendor payments.\nIn doing so, Roza said, people should remember one thing about school district vendor data: scandal can be rooted in them. She cited a case from Chicago, where the former CEO of the public school district ended up spending nearly three years in federal prison because she steered tens of millions in no-bid contracts to her friends.\nAnd Richard Henry, the state\u2019s inspector general for education, encouraged the public to contact his office if they see anything in the contracting data that seems suspicious.\n\u201cI always encourage individuals to give us a call, and if they want to remain anonymous, they can remain anonymous,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWe continue to encourage outreach to all members of the education profession throughout the state and throughout the county governments to report any type of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based in part on the work of 38 Philip Merrill College of Journalism students who were enrolled in a mid-level reporting class in the spring semester.

    "summary": "Maryland\u2019s public school districts spent $21.1 billion on non-salary expenses between 2019 and 2022, with health care costs topping the list. The data, compiled from over 26,000 vendor payments of $25,000 or more, reflects a significant influx of federal pandemic relief funds but offers limited pre-pandemic spending comparisons due to reporting requirements.",
    "content": "With employee health care costs leading the way, Maryland\u2019s public school districts spent $21.1 billion between fiscal years 2019 and 2022 not on teacher and staff salaries, but on everything else that keeps the schools running.\nThat\u2019s the bottom line if you add up all 26,000-plus vendor payments of $25,000 or more made by Maryland\u2019s school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years.\nThose vendor payments are included in \u201cContracted Out,\u201d a deep dive into school contract spending assembled by the Local News Network at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.\n\u201cContracted Out\u201d comes in the wake of an unprecedented influx of federal funding into Maryland\u2019s school districts. The federal government has sent more than $3.2 billion in COVID-19 pandemic relief funds to Maryland schools since 2020, with few strings attached. Much of that money will be reflected in the school spending data.\n\u201cThe last couple of years are super interesting because districts got this massive windfall of cash,\u201d said Marguerite Roza, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Edunomics Lab, a research institute that studies education funding data.\nBut the data \u2014 compiled largely from the state\u2019s Open Data Portal \u2014 offers only limited insights into overall spending patterns.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because only a small number of Maryland school districts published vendor data until the General Assembly required them to do so starting in 2019, meaning there\u2019s no way to compare spending from before the pandemic with spending in recent years.\u00a0\nOn top of that, under state law, 23 of the state\u2019s 24 school districts don\u2019t have to publicly report the reasons for their vendor payments.\nEven so, the \u201cContracted Out\u201d data shows all of the following to be major expenses for Maryland school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years::\nHealth care\nCareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which provides health insurance to many Maryland school employees, by far ranks as the biggest vendor for the state\u2019s school districts. The data shows that CareFirst pulled in $3.3 billion from Maryland\u2019s school districts between fiscal years 2019 and 2022.\u00a0\nNo other vendor comes close, but several other health care providers or insurers \u2014 including Express Scripts, Aetna, CVS Caremark, Cigna and SilverScript \u2014 each did more than $200 million in business with Maryland public schools over four years.\nHowever, some significant health care spending doesn\u2019t immediately stand out in the data. Allegany County Public Schools, for example, paid $79.7 million to Citibank over four years, but it was all for health care. The district simply uses a Citibank account to pay what it owes to Cigna, its health insurer, said Larry McKenzie, the district\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really unusual, especially for a large employer,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cWe have a custodial account, basically, set up with Citibank that Cigna uses to pay our claims on our behalf.\u201d\nSome other districts pay for their employee health care through a shared account that shows up on the county budget rather than the school district budget, said Milton E. Nagel, executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.\nConstruction\nEvery school district in the state manages multiple buildings, and some larger districts find themselves serving increasingly large student populations. That being the case, five construction contractors did more than $150 million of business with Maryland school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 fiscal years. They are Keller Brothers, HESS Construction & Engineering Services, Oak Contracting, Dustin Construction and Whiting-Turner Contracting.\nMontgomery County Public Schools had among the most robust construction programs, with Keller Brothers and Dustin ranking as its top contractors. Jessica M. Baxter, a spokeswoman for the district, listed two dozen construction or renovation projects managed by those two companies in Montgomery County, the state\u2019s largest school district, with more than 160,000 students.\nPrince George\u2019s County Public Schools spent more than $150 million on construction, yet still ended up spending the most in the state \u2014 $13.8 million \u2014 on temporary classrooms from a company called Modular Genius.\n\u201cThis speaks to school overcrowding, displacement due to school construction, enrollment increases/overutilization rates,\u201d said Meghan Gebreselassie, the district\u2019s director of communications.\nTechnology\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a big boost in spending on technology at many school districts in the state \u2014 and to a lot of business for tech companies.\nTen IT service and equipment companies did at least $35 million in business with Maryland school districts over four years, with CDW Government Inc., a tech services provider to every school district in the state, leading the way with $331.9 million.\u00a0\nAmong manufacturers, Hewlett Packard ranked as the top vendor, receiving $147 million from Maryland school districts over four years. All of that business came from Baltimore County Public Schools.\n\u201cBCPS was among the first and largest school systems in the state to commit to and implement a program through which every student had access to a personal PC,\u201d said Charles Herndon, a spokesman for Baltimore County Public Schools. \u201cAlso included in the amount was other educational technical hardware, networking systems and PC leasing, among other expenses.\u201d\nOther tech companies benefited, too. Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools spent $61.3 million on Dell products and $15.6 million on Apple.\nThanks to the pandemic, \u201cwe had to purchase over 150,000 Dell Chromebooks in order to meet the needs of students,\u201d said Gebreselassie. In addition, she said \u201cPGCPS utilizes iPads for early childhood education and purchased over 19,000 of them to support students during distance learning.\u201d\nBasic operations\nAbout 890,000 students attend public schools in Maryland, and it costs billions to transport them, feed them and give them the materials they need in order to learn. So here\u2019s a quick look at what the vendor records show about those expenses:\n\nDistricts take different approaches to transporting students. Half the districts in the state did business with American Truck & Bus Inc., a bus dealer that ended up getting $79.4 million in business from the schools. But other districts, such as Carroll County Public Schools, rely on private bus operators \u2014 and two of them, Lawrence M. Schaffer and Mark C. Garcia, got $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, from that school district.\nFour food suppliers \u2014 Dori Foods, US Foods, Eastern Food Services and Cloverland Dairy \u2014 rank among the largest 100 school vendors in the state. But there are dozens of others, as districts tend to rely on small local produce and dairy providers as well as big national food distributors.\nAmazon ranked as one of the state\u2019s leading office suppliers, with $14.2 million in business over three years. That\u2019s half of what the districts gave to Office Depot, but rural districts tended more often to buy from Amazon. Garrett County, for example, spent $1.4 million on Amazon over four years. \u201cGarrett County is a rural county with limited options for purchasing locally,\u201d said Mark Greene, the district\u2019s manager of communications and public relations.\n\nCharter schools\nMaryland\u2019s public school districts didn\u2019t spend nearly as much money on charter schools as they did on basic operations. But they did spend at least $228.9 million on them over four years.\nThat figure comes from cross-referencing the vendor data submitted by Maryland\u2019s school districts with the list of charter schools published on the State Department of Education website.\nCharter schools are publicly funded institutions that operate independently from many state regulations, but are held to certain educational standards set out in their founding document, or charter. They do not charge tuition and are mandated to be secular, and they aim to give parents a choice of where their children should go to school.\nIn total, around 3% of the state\u2019s student population attends one of Maryland\u2019s 48 recognized charter schools, according to the State Department of Education. But in Baltimore City, they make up a much larger portion of the educational landscape. Baltimore City contains 31 charter schools, serving nearly one-fifth of the district\u2019s student population.\nThe district \u201chas been open to innovative ways to meet the diverse needs of students even before charter law was established in the state of Maryland,\u201d said Sherry Christian, the Baltimore City Public Schools media and public relations manager.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based on reporting from CNS reporters Sarah Meklir, Matthew Landsman and Joey Barke.",

    "summary": "Maryland school districts have spent large sums on mysterious expenses, including a $694.1 million payment to an \"Electronic Funds Transf Program\" in Anne Arundel County that remains unexplained despite inquiries. Other surprising expenditures include catering at an Italian restaurant and retirement gifts from a local jewelry store.",
    "content": "If you take a look at some of the ways Maryland school districts spend your tax dollars, you may be left with an obvious question:\nWhy?\nIn one major case, it\u2019s not a question the spokesman for Anne Arundel County Public Schools was willing to answer. As a result, the third-largest school expenditure in the state remains unexplained.\nHowever, other school districts explained far smaller but surprising expenses for catering at an Italian restaurant chain and retirement gifts at a local jewelry store.\nHere is a look at some of the most mysterious expenses the Local News Network found when examining more than 26,000 vendor payments of $25,000 or more made by Maryland\u2019s school districts between the 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school years:\nIn Anne Arundel County, the school district paid $694.1 million to something called \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program.\u201d\nIt\u2019s common for people, businesses and government entities to transfer funds electronically. That\u2019s what happens, for example, if you pay your bills online. But bank statements specify who got paid via electronic transfer. They don\u2019t do what the Anne Arundel school district did, which is simply note that a huge amount of money has been transferred electronically without any clear indication of why or where it was transferred.\nMysterious as it is, Anne Arundel\u2019s \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program\u201d ranked as the third-highest-paid public school vendor in the state, behind CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and Kelly & Associates Insurance Group.\nThe Local News Network contacted Bob Mosier, chief communications officer for Anne Arundel County Public Schools, multiple times to inquire about the \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program\u201d and what it pays for.\u00a0\nAt first, Mosier promised answers \u2014 but then he stopped responding to emails. As a result, Anne Arundel County\u2019s biggest vendor outlay remains a mystery.\nIn Howard County, the public school system paid $746.5 million over those four years to Kelly & Associates Insurance Group. That made Kelly & Associates the second-highest-paid vendor among the 6,009 companies that did business with Maryland school districts between financial years 2019 and 2022.\n\u201cPrior to this fiscal year, we used Kelly & Associates Insurance Group to manage the payments for each of our benefit providers (medical, dental, vision, etc.) and Kelly & Associates Financial to manage all employee/employer payroll taxes and garnishments,\u201d said Brian Bassett, director of communication and engagement for the Howard County Public School System.\nWhile the Local News Network\u2019s \u201cContracted Out\u201d project focuses on school expenses between fiscal years 2019 and 2022, one 2018 expenditure stood out In Baltimore County \u2014 where a $1.57 million payment went to an \u201cunknown vendor.\u201d\nIn other words, district officials don\u2019t know exactly where $1.57 million went. Charles Herndon, a spokesman for the district, blamed it on a massive ransomware attack that hit the school system\u2019s computers in November 2020.\nThat attack led to a \u201ccatastrophic compromise of all BCPS functions and operations,\u201d Herndon said.\nThat data breach happened when a district employee opened an email attachment that was really a phishing attack. Recovering from that data breach cost the district more than $10 million, district officials said.\nAs for the data that was lost, \u201cinstead of creating thousands of individual vendors, a generic \u2018unknown vendor\u2019 was used to restore the accounting,\u201d Herndon said.\nWhile many districts didn\u2019t report any 2018 school spending data because the law didn\u2019t require them to do so, Baltimore County has been reporting that data since 2011, which is why the Local News Network was able to find that 2018 expenditure.\nIn Prince George\u2019s County, the public school district spent $87,596.83 at Three Brothers Italian Restaurants between fiscal years 2019 and 2022. To be more specific, the district spent $55,321.53 at Three Brothers in Greenbelt during the 2018-2019 school year and another $32,275.30 at the restaurant\u2019s Hyattsville location in the 2021-2022 school year.\nThe district appears to have a longstanding relationship with Three Brothers. While most school districts in the state didn\u2019t start reporting their vendor expenses to the state until 2019, Prince George\u2019s County has been doing so since 2012. Those older figures show the school district spent $82,505.60 at Three Brothers in 2017 and 2018.\nAsked for an explanation, Raven Hill, the district\u2019s associate superintendent for communications and community engagement, indicated Three Brothers is a go-to caterer for school events.\n\u201cThe catering expenses were spent across many schools, generally for student celebrations and staff/family meetings,\u201d Hill said. \u201cFor context, schools often provide food at parent meetings to encourage attendance. Meals were also provided to students at several community schools (low-income population, wraparound services) as incentives.\u201d\nIn Calvert County, school district officials haven\u2019t been just buying school supplies, textbooks and computers. They\u2019ve been buying wristwatches, too.\nThe district spent over $25,000 at JW Jewelers, a locally owned jewelry store in Prince Frederick, in 2021.\nThe expenditure was for 118 watches gifted to retiring employees, costing roughly $218 apiece, according to the district\u2019s chief financial officer, Scott Johnson.\nLocal News Network Director Jerry Zremski compiled this story based on reporting by CNS reporters Sarah Meklir, Christine Folivi and Zachary Intrater. After publication of this story, the Local News Network received a response from Anne Arundel County Schools to a request made under the Maryland Public Information Act, in which LNN asked for a list of all payments made under \u201cElectronic Funds Transf Program.\u201d The response to the request shows that all those payments went to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Other counties made similar payments of employee tax collections, but LNN deleted all intergovernmental transfers from the project database so that the data would focus more clearly on payments to private vendors.",

    "summary": "Tom Ackerman, inspired by taking his challenging class outdoors, became a proponent for outdoor education, joining a coalition supporting the No Child Left Inside Act, which aims to provide federal funding for environmental education. Outdoor education has been shown to positively impact students' educational, physical, and emotional development.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When Tom Ackerman first began his teaching career in Harford County, the end of the school day always brought about frustration.\nDuring the final minutes of the class, he would attempt to wrangle his most challenging students\u2019 attention and connect them with his lessons.\nBut one day, Ackerman\u2019s principal \u2013 a former gym teacher \u2013 gave the science teacher a piece of advice that changed everything: take the students outside.\nAckerman started teaching his most difficult class outside on Friday afternoons. Each week, students would return to the classroom and excitedly share what they discovered. Before long, all of his classes wanted the same experience.\u00a0\n\u201cThey were just into it,\u201d said Ackerman, who is now the Chesapeake Bay Foundation\u2019s vice president for education.\u00a0\nThat moment was one of many that spurred Ackerman to join a nationwide coalition to improve access to outdoor education opportunities for K-12 students.\u00a0\nFor more than a decade, educators, environmentalists and dozens of policymakers have struggled to spur congressional action on Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes\u2019s No Child Left Inside Act, which would allocate federal funding to environmental education initiatives.\nLast month, the bill\u2019s sponsors reintroduced the No Child Left Inside Act in Congress more than a decade after it was first proposed. The coalition\u2019s reiterated push for action on the measure comes as climate change education and pandemic learning loss conversations have become increasingly present in American politics.\nIf passed, the No Child Left Inside Act would provide states with federal grants to develop partnerships between schools and organizations to foster real-world environmental and scientific experiences.\u00a0\nOutdoor education programs have been proven to have a positive effect on the educational, physical and emotional development of young people, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\u00a0\nOne 2018 study published in Frontiers in Psychology compared outcomes from identical lessons taught inside and outside and concluded that teachers were able to teach for almost twice as long without having to interrupt instruction to redirect students after outdoor lessons.\nThe No Child Left Inside Act has been reintroduced multiple times in Congress since first stalling in 2007. Even in years where the bill has passed out of the House, it has consistently faced challenges in the opposite chamber.\u00a0\nDespite the initiative\u2019s bumpy history, Sarbanes said its timely passage is crucial to help future generations prepare for and combat the looming effects of climate change.\u00a0\n\u201cOur young people are going to be the stewards of the planet and they\u2019re the leading edge of what we do to preserve our planet and combat climate change,\u201d Sarbanes told Capital News Service. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way of getting them ready for that responsibility than making sure that they have strong environmental education opportunities.\u201d\nAdvocates also believe the bill\u2019s subject matter revolves around a top priority for parents, students and educators across the country as they emerge from distance learning and attempt to make up for massive pandemic learning loss.\nThe 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress showed an average four-point drop in learning nationally compared with 2019 \u2013 equating to roughly two decades of educational progress.\n\u201cYou would think that learning outdoors would have been the solution to living through a pandemic, but there were all kinds of reasons why that didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Jackie Ostfeld who directs the Sierra Club\u2019s Outdoors For All campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s no quicker way to make up for learning loss and to grow test scores and to get your kids outdoors.\u201d\nThe pandemic \u201cshined a light\u201d on how important engaged, in-person learning experiences are for students, Ostfeld said. Mitigating the pandemic\u2019s impact on American education has also coincided with the bill having its strongest coalition ever this year, Ostfeld added.\nThe coalition has made progress in recent years by aligning the bill\u2019s goals with other federal education initiatives. The 2015 Every Students Succeed Act included a provision from the No Child Left Inside Act that helped states integrate environmental learning into their regular curriculum.\nBut the No Child Left Inside Act is still a \u201clong game\u201d initiative, Ostfeld said.\u00a0\nDespite its slow progress, the bill\u2019s consistent presence in Congress has already prompted dozens of states to develop environmental literacy plans in anticipation of its passage. Maryland was the first state in the nation to implement this plan, as the state requires an environmental literacy graduation requirement for all high schoolers.\nBills that are proactive and work to guide slow but steady progress take longer to pass than those brought on by a glaring national issue, Ostfeld said. Even if 2023 is not the year for federal action, millions of students in states that have started to incorporate outdoor education curriculum will continue to benefit from advocacy related to it.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not reacting to some horrible thing in the world. We are being proactive and saying, \u2018This is what the future needs to look like,\u2019\u201d Ostfeld said. \u201cThis bill helped to spark a movement, but now the movement is out there and the movement is strong. Every time the movement gets stronger and stronger and stronger, decision makers in Washington will hear about it.\u201d",

    "summary": "PointsBet ended its marketing deal with the University of Maryland, joining Michigan State and Colorado in terminating sports betting partnerships amid growing controversies. The terms and details of these agreements have largely been kept secret through third-party contracts, complicating transparency efforts.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2013 PointsBet sports book terminated its marketing deal with the University of Maryland in late April, according to published reports, and all parties are silent on the fallout from the end of the contract.\nThe partnership allowed PointsBet to advertise on UMD\u2019s campus, in its arenas, and across sports radio broadcast airwaves. A series of contracts allowed the public university to keep secret the terms of the deal. The move means that at least three top schools \u2013 Michigan State, Maryland and Colorado \u2013 with betting marketing contracts have now ended those agreements as problems and criticism of them mount. Another agreement with LSU is uncertain after Caesar\u2019s signage was removed there.\nThe University of Maryland College Park signed an agreement originating in December 2021 with the sports marketing firm PlayFly Sports, which then created a company just to deal with UMCP marketing deals called Maryland Sports Properties. It is PlayFly\u2019s Maryland Sports Properties that contracted with PointsBet to be the official gaming sponsor of Maryland Athletics.\n[ Read more in our series, Gambling On Campus ]\nUniversity President Darryll Pines\u2019 office, as well as Athletics administrators Damon Evans and Jason Yellin, declined to respond to Capital News Service emails seeking information about the contract. Only Brian Ullman, Maryland\u2019s vice president of Marketing and Communications responded, referring all inquiries from CNS to PointsBet, which did not respond to repeated requests for information and clarification.\nThe Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, both at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, reported in February that some universities shield their sports betting agreements by working with third-party marketing companies. The Povich and Howard centers discovered a close relationship between the University of Maryland and Maryland Sports Properties. Some MSP officials had university-issued email accounts and an office at Xfinity Center, the athletic venue where many UMD sports teams play and some coaches and administrators have offices.\u00a0\nLegal Sports Report, an online site, reported the Maryland deal was off on Tuesday, and other online sites, including Sports Handle, have reported the termination. Darren Rovell, a reporter with Action HQ, first reported the Maryland deal was off in a tweet on April 27.\n\u201cPointsBet and Playfly Sports have reached a mutual agreement to end their sponsorship at the University of Maryland,\u201d the company said in a statement to Legal Sports Report. Other published reports have indicated that PointsBet\u2019s U.S. business is up for sale.\nNews of the end of the Maryland deal comes as SB 620, a bill requiring universities to fully disclose all terms of partnerships with sports gaming entities and banning commission-based profit by schools, awaits the signature of Gov. Wes Moore.\u00a0\nThis bill was also designed to enhance transparency around gaming contracts by disallowing contracts via third parties and saying that all such contracts are, \u201csubject to public inspection in accordance with the Maryland Public Information Act.\u201d When this legislation was passed, Maryland\u2019s contract with PointsBet through PlayFly Sports, was already in effect and not subject to the bill.\n\u201cWhat this (contract ending) shows is that the University of Maryland is acknowledging they made a serious mistake in partnering with a predatory gambling operator,\u201d said Les Bernal of Stop Predatory Gambling. \u201cFor the sake of greed, at the expense of its own students. They placed greed over the best interests of students and they finally moved away from that.\u201d\nThe contract termination comes amid controversy in the college sports betting arena. In late March, the University of Colorado terminated a similar contract with PointsBet.\nThe University of Alabama fired head baseball coach Brad Bohannon for directly interacting with a bettor in Ohio who bet against the Crimson Tide. Similarly, Iowa athletics is investigating 26 student-athletes from varying sports teams regarding possible sports betting violations. Specifically, the Iowa gaming commission is investigating the Hawkeyes baseball team.\nThe end of the deal leaves a lot up in the air: Will the collapse of both the Maryland and Colorado deal deter other universities from entering such contracts? Will Maryland pursue another partnership with a sports gaming entity? What was the motivation for ending the PointsBet/Maryland deal and how will both entities now move forward?\nRebecca Snyder, executive director of the MDDC Press Association, provided possible reasons for PointsBet backing out of the deal while acknowledging the potential for Maryland to pursue another contract.\n\u201cIt could mean (PointsBet is), like, full-scale eliminating all their contracts with schools. Maybe that says either it\u2019s not profitable enough for them or it\u2019s too complicated or maybe \u2026 there\u2019s too much scrutiny and it\u2019s not worth their ability to do it,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything went off the table. Whatever agreement they come to, they\u2019ll need to know that it\u2019ll have more transparency in that process, more scrutiny and of course more discussion. It seems like a really lucrative business so I can\u2019t imagine that somebody won\u2019t try to jump in at some point to create another agreement.\u201d\nBernal agreed that sports gaming entities will not be shy in continuing to pursue such deals because sports betting is profitable. That means it\u2019s the responsibility of universities to protect students by avoiding these partnerships, he said. Public pressure also likely increases universities\u2019 reluctance.\u00a0\n\u201cThe University of Maryland did not do this out of their own good will. I think they did it because they were facing, you know, growing, intense public scrutiny and good media reporting,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cI think PointsBet wants these deals, badly. I think universities are facing intense, intense scrutiny not to do these deals. I think PointsBet would do a deal with every university in this country if they could.\u201d\nAs sports betting continues to be legalized across the country, the issue of how schools balance joining such contracts with protecting students is going to become more imperative, experts say.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had three schools that have announced that they had disciplinary measures because of student athletes betting or coaches betting. It\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Tom McMillen, former U.S. congressman and president and chief executive officer of Lead1, which represents athletics directors at 131 member universities of the Football Bowl Subdivision. McMillen is uniquely qualified to discuss the issue because he is a former University of Maryland All-American basketball player and Olympian, who went on to play 11 years in the NBA with the Buffalo Braves, New York Knicks, Atlanta Hawks and Washington Bullets.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think sports betting is going to go away in the United States,\u201d McMillen said, \u201cBut I think there are some very necessary steps that have to be taken before anyone engages in those areas, because it\u2019s just, it\u2019s highly risky.\u201d\nMcMillen specifically referenced the need for universities to have safe spaces to help students with gambling addictions, debts, and any other potential consequence of sports gambling, if they decide to pursue such contracts.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have to make it a part of your whole medical center, and you have to talk about the problems of gambling,\u201d McMillen said. \u201cEvery school needs to take precautionary steps to make sure that this doesn\u2019t blow up in their face.\u201d\n[ Read more in our series, Gambling On Campus ]\nIf a new contract were to be signed in Maryland moving forward, its details should be easily accessible to the public and state legislature, unlike UMD\u2019s previous contracts, under the legislation pending before Moore. While Snyder acknowledged the importance of transparency, Bernal said universities should not participate in these deals in any capacity.\u00a0\n\u201cOn the bright side, I feel like now, especially with the legislation that was passed, this last session, whatever contracts or agreements come in place subsequent to this contract termination will have to be more public, which I think is definitely a good thing,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cWhen public dollars are involved, and certainly the University of Maryland gets all or most of its funding through the state, I think more transparency is required. They have a duty to the public and to the state to show how they\u2019re spending their money as well as how they\u2019re transacting to monetize their student body essentially.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in the public interest for a public university to be partnering with any of these predatory dealing operators and this is just one baby step towards making a huge difference on this issue,\u201d said Bernal. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any deals with any gaming operators, regardless of the transparency or not, because it\u2019s a dangerous and addictive product for college students.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 One of the biggest changes to state education policy to come out of the Maryland General Assembly this session didn\u2019t actually originate from lawmakers \u2013 it came from the new attitude in the governor\u2019s office.\nGov. Wes Moore emphasized access to a good education for all in Maryland, and demonstrated he isn\u2019t afraid to spend money on ensuring that.\nWhen the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future school reform plan passed in 2021 by the Maryland General Assembly, it came on an override of former Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of the bill. In contrast, Gov. Wes Moore allocated an extra $500 million on top of the required amount for funding the Blueprint and shifted some transportation funding into education, for a total of $900 million excess dollars.\n\u201cTo have a governor that not only is willing to talk with you, but collaborate and work in partnership on ideas is refreshing,\u201d said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association. \u201dIt really speaks to his character and his priority for education and eliminating childhood poverty, because a lot of that is tied to education.\u201d\nMoore continued to demonstrate his dedication to improving education in Maryland through the Maryland Educator Shortage Reduction Act of 2023, one of his 10 proposed pieces of legislation for the 2023 General Assembly session that ended April 10.\n\u201cThe pandemic dealt a serious blow to our education workforce. Teachers are tired, strained, and overworked \u2013 and they need reinforcements, here and now. That is why I am calling on the General Assembly to pass the Maryland Educator Shortage Act \u2013 to strengthen the pipeline of qualified teachers in our state,\u201d said Moore in his state of the state address at the beginning of February.\nThe bill, which currently sits on the governor\u2019s desk, seeks to establish specific recruitment and retention goals for teachers in the state.\n\u201cWe are really happy that it\u2019s another tool that can be used during this historic educator shortage time that we\u2019re in,\u201d Bost told Capital News Service.\nMore tools are needed, though, to fully staff schools, including a Grow-Your-Own program, cut from the bill, which aims to recruit educators who will teach in their own communities and help those who are aiming to be teachers in different areas like offering scholarships or helping create partnerships with schools, she said.\nBut teacher shortages are not the only shortages faced in education, both in Maryland and nationwide.\n\u201cWe have lots of vacancies, as parents know, with bus drivers or paraeducators that work with students or cafeteria workers and just as we have historic vacancies in teachers and administrators, we also have vacancies in these positions that we have to address,\u201d Bost said.\nIn the future, she hopes to see a work group created to study why these vacancies exist, how they can retain workers, and consider appropriate wages.\nAnother bill Bost was excited to see pass this session was one that would require teachers to receive training for virtual education, and provide the option for counties to have virtual school days in cases of extreme weather.\n\u201cWe know that post-pandemic we\u2019re still going to have some virtual schools or at least virtual programs, and we wanted to make sure that they were top notch,\u201d she said. Baltimore City and Baltimore Democrat Sen. Mary Washington\u2019s bill, she said, puts \u201cin some really good guardrails\u201d to bring parity to virtual schools with physical schools.\nIt was down to the wire before the deadline for adjournment when the Senate took up discussion on the bill, but it finally passed with a majority just minutes before the session came to a close at midnight.\nIn addition to bills that directly pertain to education, many proposals from this session will have a far-reaching impact into many aspects of life, including education.\nThe Maryland Education Coalition was tracking a bill from Del. Stephanie Smith, D-Baltimore City, that would establish a neighborhood tier system to determine the number of students eligible for reduced or free lunch at school.\n\u201cWe think that the neighborhood tiers is probably the most accurate way to count poverty and we want to move towards that, but I don\u2019t think the legislature was quite ready, and I think it\u2019s a very complicated formula, honestly, to look at, so that\u2019s something I think will come back next year,\u201d said Ellie Mitchell, co-chair of MEC. \u201cThat may end up increasing the overall cost of the Blueprint, when we have students counted the way they should be.\u201d\nIn addition to pushing for future passage of that bill, MEC also wants to focus on what Ricky Tyler, who co-chairs with Mitchell, calls \u201cstudent services,\u201d aka their social, emotional, mental and behavioral health, as well as juvenile service issues.\n\u201cWe need to look at (these issues) because that is part of ensuring that the kids come ready to school, ready to learn,\u201d he said.\nOddly, of the almost 100 bills the governor signed the day after adjournment, just one was related to education: the use of alcoholic beverages for educational purposes. SB672, which was cross-filed with HB987, allows students 18 and up to taste certain alcoholic beverages as a part of an educational class.\nOther education-related bills awaiting his signature now are an update to the Maryland State School Health Services guidelines regarding anaphylactic food allergies and for local school boards to disclose foods served in the schools as well as the major allergens they contain; and one that requires public schools to disclose information to students, staff and parents about Title IX coordinators and the processes and supports in place for those who file sexual misconduct complaints.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Growing up as the oldest child in a single-parent home, Brittani Williams longed to leave her Baton Rouge, Louisiana, home for better opportunities and challenged herself to be a role model for her siblings.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was my charge given to me by me to get a college degree so that I could show my siblings that they could do the same,\u201d said Williams, who is now a senior policy analyst in higher education for The Education Trust, an advocacy organization that promotes educational equity.\nAlthough going to college changed her life, the financial impact was stressful.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a student loan borrower. I didn\u2019t want to be, but because of the circumstances, the lack of wealth in my family, I had to be a borrower,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat was my choice, my option, because (not) getting a college degree was not an option for me.\u201d\u00a0\nHer experience is far from isolated: 45 million Americans have federal student loan debt totaling $1.6 trillion, according to the White House.\u00a0\nAnd research and polling has shown that student debt is linked to increased anxiety and depression. An upcoming Supreme Court decision on student debt relief could only add to the stress.\nTo address the rising amount of higher education debt, President Joe Biden introduced a student loan relief plan in August 2022 that would forgive up to $10,000 in debt per individual and $20,000 for those who received a Pell Grant.\u00a0\nBut now, two legal challenges to the plan have reached the Supreme Court, which could shut down the forgiveness plan.\u00a0\n\u201c\u200b\u200bPeople take out student loans with huge hopes and dreams. It\u2019s supposed to get them through this degree that\u2019s going to launch them into a career and help them achieve the American dream,\u201d said Sabrina Cereceres, special project manager at the Student Debt Crisis Center, an organization that helps student loan borrowers navigate repayment options.\u00a0\n\u201c(But) when it comes to time to repay their loans, they\u2019re making payments, they\u2019re trying to navigate this repayment system, and then, you know, a lot of these borrowers just see their account balances go up and up,\u201d Cereceres said.\u00a0\nBorrowers are now anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling decisions on whether the federal loan forgiveness plan is valid.\u00a0\nThe legal challenges come in the midst of an existing mental health crisis.\nA majority of Americans \u2013 54% \u2013 has reported experiencing mental health issues related to student debt, according to a September poll by ELVTR, a virtual learning platform.\nThe survey of 2,000 people between 18 and 67 with some college experience revealed that 56% said they suffered anxiety due to their student debt; 32% reported depression, 20% insomnia and 17% panic attacks.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe mental toll of student debt especially affects Black borrowers and students who come from low-wealth backgrounds, who are already disproportionately undertreated for mental health.\u00a0\nIn many studies and research papers that have investigated this phenomenon, two major solutions to the stress of student loans are getting assistance from parental wealth and securing high-paying jobs.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments on Feb. 28 in two legal cases challenging the constitutionality of Biden\u2019s plan. Protesters and leaders from advocacy groups clustered around the court with colorful signs and loudspeakers, chanting in the direction of the justices inside to allow the relief plan to go through.\u00a0\nThe uncertainty of policy surrounding college affordability and whether loans will be forgiven may even add to existing anxiety for borrowers, according to Erica White, a research scholar at the Center for Public Health Law and Policy.\u00a0\nMany borrowers don\u2019t even know when they\u2019ll have to start payments again as the Biden administration has continued to push a COVID-19 emergency loan payment pause into 2023. Waiting , and waiting for a high court decision adds to that unpredictability, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re just feeling very jaded with the Supreme Court,\u201d White said. \u201cI would imagine that just adds to the lack of trust and the stress that everyone is experiencing right now.\u201d\nStudent debt is a public health concern, according to White.\u00a0\n\u201cThis court is just really not motivated by public health data,\u201d White said.\u00a0\nEven if the conservative majority on the Supreme Court invalidates Biden\u2019s plan, Williams said that she and other advocates will continue to explore other alternatives to make college more affordable.\u00a0\n\u201cWe, as in stakeholders in higher education reform, we should not count it as a loss because there is more work to be done,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think that my message would be, you know, to be hopeful.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Ben Cardin and Rep. David Trone, both Maryland Democrats, have proposed legislation aimed at addressing educational inequities and eliminating academic achievement gaps.\nThe TRUE EQUITY Act, whose full title is \u200b\u200bTransformational Reforms and Updates to Ensure Educational Quality and Urgent Investments in Today\u2019s Youth Act of 2023, would provide $1.4 billion in federal grants for states and local communities that prioritize education policy changes and address education inequities in traditionally underserved areas.\n\u201cMaryland students deserve the very best public education, and we are united in this fight for the federal government to be a strong partner in the positive transformation of our schools,\u201d Cardin and Trone said in a statement last month. \u201cThe TRUE EQUITY Act establishes a stronger federal partnership with state and local communities dedicated to providing their children a world-class education.\u201d\nThe legislation parallels policy recommendations of the Maryland Commission on Innovation & Excellence in Education\u2019s Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future. Passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021, the Blueprint will make major changes to the Maryland public education system over a decade with annual education funding increases of $3.8 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mirror image in some ways, in terms of the priorities in the federal legislation,\u201d Ellie Mitchell, co-chair of the Maryland Education Coalition, told Capital News Service. \u201cI think it\u2019s designed really to think about trying to take a little bit of the load off of the state burden that is created by the Kirwan Commission in the Blueprint\u2026 So I\u2019m sure the intent is to find a way to do some federal offset to this huge influx of state funding that is happening.\u201d\nThe implementation costs of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future Act would be partially covered by federal grants provided through the TRUE EQUITY Act.\nDuring March, initial implementation plans of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future were due from local school districts, the Maryland State Department of Education and other agencies involved with implementing the Blueprint. Based on the legislation\u2019s implementation timeline, by July 2026 the minimum teacher salary in every Maryland school district will be $60,000.\nWhile his legislation is based on Maryland\u2019s education reform plan, \u201cany state or local jurisdiction can apply for funding as long as they are open to strengthening intergovernmental partnerships that will further student achievement, eliminate disparities and provide a world-class public education to all students,\u201d Cardin said in a statement to CNS.\nThe COVID pandemic played a large role in furthering education disparities, especially for minority and low-income students, according to Cardin and Trone.\nIn an effort to reverse these effects and improve public school systems, the legislation would focus on five main areas.\nThese areas would include new grants to invest in early childhood education, funding additional teacher training, giving all students access to career and college pathways by 10th grade and funding programs that aim to reduce achievement gaps. The legislation would also require states applying for funding to form state oversight boards, which would hold state and local school districts accountable if they did not meet state educational equity goals.\n\u201cWe now know that COVID-19 exacerbated existing disparities and achievement gaps, so the additional support is all the more essential,\u201d Cardin said.\n\u201cThe teacher crisis is not a pandemic-created situation,\u201d Mitchell agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been hurtling towards for a long time, in terms of teacher shortages, and also in terms of not having the diverse workforce that we want within education.\u201d\nThe Maryland Education Coalition\u2019s mission is primarily to ensure sufficient funding and equitable policies with transparent accountability in public education, based on the Maryland Constitution, which requires a \u201cthorough and efficient set of free public schools,\u201d said co-chair Rick Tyler Jr.\nTyler said he hopes that the Maryland congressional delegation will be able to win support from colleagues from other states.\n\u201cI will also say that Maryland historically has been a leader in education reform nationally. My initial understanding I have is that many other states are looking at what Maryland is doing,\u201d said Tyler. \u201cThat may be another way where they will join in and support this legislation.\u201d\nThe measure also drew praise from Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association.\n\u201cThe TRUE EQUITY Act will provide a true federal partnership with our state and local efforts to eliminate academic disparities across racial and socioeconomic lines and elevate the teaching profession,\u201d Bost said in a statement.\nMaryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Sarbanes, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin and Glenn Ivey also back the legislation.",

    "summary": "Howard County and Anne Arundel County in Maryland have recently implemented later school start times, aligning with growing national efforts to address adolescent sleep deprivation, which is linked to improved academic performance and mental health. Teenagers' natural circadian rhythms make it difficult for them to get enough sleep when schools start early, according to experts.",
    "content": "When the Howard County Board of Education voted last month to start the school day later, it became the second Maryland jurisdiction in just two years to push its school start times back.\nThe movement for later school start times has been gaining momentum for decades. Those efforts have come to fruition as Howard County passed a resolution to push its high school start time to 8 a.m. in the same academic year that Anne Arundel County implemented its 8:30 a.m. high school start times.\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools announced that it was shifting to \u201chealthier school start and dismissal times for students.\u201d\nStudies show that sleep deprivation in adolescents is a known risk factor for increased drug use, depression and suicide. Academic performance as well as students\u2019 physical and mental health improve when students are able to get more sleep, according to research done by the University of Minnesota.\nLater school start times have also been shown to reduce student\u2019s sleepiness and school tardiness per a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\u201cWhat good are all the amazing classes offered in [Howard County Public School System] high schools if students are asleep in class? Or if the students can\u2019t retain the information they are taught because they don\u2019t get enough REM sleep?\u201d Marriotts Ridge High School student Audrey Grutzik said at a Howard County school board meeting in January.\nTeenagers experience a shift in their circadian clocks, also known as a biological or internal rhythm, after puberty. They get tired later at night and wake up later in the morning, and early school start times force high school students to ignore those biological needs.\n\u201cIf school starts too early, adolescents are \u2026 being asked to function at a time that is misaligned with their biological clock,\u201d said Dr. Amy Wolfson, who is on the board of directors of the Sleep Research Society and a professor at Loyola University in Maryland.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that high-school aged students need eight to 10 hours of sleep a day.\nBut the most recent Maryland Department of Health youth risk survey in the 2018-19 school year found that only about 22% of Maryland high school students surveyed actually get the recommended eight hour minimum of sleep, with a majority of respondents saying they get six hours or less of nightly rest.\n\nIn the 2022-23 school year, 17 of Maryland\u2019s 24 jurisdictions\u2019 average high school start times are before 8 a.m. Howard will be just the eighth jurisdiction in the state whose high schools\u2019 average start time is at 8 a.m. or later when its resolution takes effect, joining Anne Arundel, Dorchester, Garrett, Prince George\u2019s, St. Mary\u2019s, Washington and Worcester counties.\n\nWith Anne Arundel and Howard counties shifting to later start times, they are still among the few Maryland school districts that fall in line with recommendations from the state health department and American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThe Maryland General Assembly passed the Orange Ribbon for Healthy School Hours certification in 2016, which was sponsored by then-delegate and now-lieutenant governor Aruna Miller. It recognizes local school systems with start times at or after 8 a.m \u2014 in line with the Maryland Department of Health and American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 recommendations.\nHoward and Anne Arundel counties both moved virtual school start times back during the COVID-19 pandemic to 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m., respectively. Lisa VanBuskirk, the leader of the Anne Arundel County and Maryland chapters of Start School Later, said that the later school start times resonated with parents and students.\nStart School Later is an organization that advocates for later school start times that are \u201ccompatible with health, safety, education, and equity.\u201d\n\"I think districts realized, \u2018Oh, my goodness, if we can start later virtually why can't we start later in reality?\u2019 and students and families [were] saying the same things,\u201d Wolfson said.\nThere are certain obstacles with the potential costs of updating transportation systems for different school start times should resolutions be passed. VanBuskirk said it can be harder for districts with smaller budgets to imagine footing potential costs when considering pushing school start times back.\nHowever, Wolfson said any smaller interventions or countermeasures to limit the downsides of sleep deprivation in students don\u2019t compare to the benefits of delaying school start times.\n\u201cSlowly but surely there is more cross-talk between the science world \u2026 and educators,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cThere is definitely more movement and more recognition now than even five or six years ago.\u201d",

Northwestern University, a private institution, leads with the highest tuition and fees, significantly outpacing inflation.",
    "content": "Big Ten universities tend to increase tuition and fees annually, but it can be hard to tell how much more expensive these schools are actually getting. Capital News Service\u2019s analysis of Big Ten tuition data from 2003-2021 shows that tuition is outpacing inflation, but differences between universities vary considerably. \nThe 14 universities in the Big Ten span from the mid-Atlantic coastal region to the Midwest. University of Maryland, Rutgers University, Pennsylvania State University, Ohio State University, Indiana University, Purdue University, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, University of Illinois, Northwestern University, University of Iowa, University of Nebraska, University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota are all in the Big Ten.\nBig Ten out-of-state tuition is outpacing inflation, while in-state costs remain level\n\n\n\nTuition increases are common in the Big Ten but since 2003, out-of-state tuition has increased much more rapidly than in-state tuition.\nOn average, Big Ten in-state tuition costs have remained relatively stagnant for 20 years. Adjusted to 2021 dollars for inflation, the Big Ten average in-state tuition has increased by $1,500 from 2003 to 2021.\nOn the other hand, out-of-state tuition costs have increased significantly. Adjusted for inflation, the Big Ten average out-of-state tuition increased by nearly $12,000 from 2003 to 2021.\n\n\n\nIn both 2003 and 2021, the Big Ten average in-state tuition was equivalent to about 19% of the national median household income. \nAlternatively, in 2003, the Big Ten average out-of-state tuition equated to about 42% of the national median household income, while in 2021, it was up to about 53%.\nNorthwestern University\u2019s tuition is greatly outpacing inflation\n\n\n\nAs a private institution, Northwestern charges all students the same tuition with no distinction between in-state and out-of-state. \nNorthwestern\u2019s tuition and fees are consistently the highest in the Big Ten by a considerable margin compared to average in-state tuition rates and by a smaller margin compared to average out-of-state tuition rates. \nPrices adjusted to 2021 dollars show a nearly $20,000 increase in Northwestern\u2019s tuition from 2003 to 2021, $8,000 more than the Big Ten average out-of-state tuition increase and $18,000 more than the average in-state tuition increase. \nIn 2003, tuition at Northwestern was equivalent to about 66% of the national median household income. In 2021, tuition equaled 86% of the median household income, a 20% increase.\nNorthwestern promotes its financial aid and scholarship numbers as offsets to its tuition costs. The average scholarship for a first-year student is $57,000 and 61% of undergraduate students receive financial aid, according to the admissions office.\nIn a January 2023 financial update signed by Northwestern University President Michael Schill, Provost Kathleen Hagerty and Executive Vice President Craig Johnson, the university noted increases in the number of low-income students enrolled and the number of students who receive financial aid.\n\u201cOur investments in financial aid also have promoted equity and access. Over the past year, we exceeded our goal of drawing more than 20% of our undergraduates from Pell-eligible lower-income families,\u201d the statement said.\nPurdue University\u2019s frozen tuition makes it an affordable option\n\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Purdue\u2019s tuition increases followed the Big Ten average and began to outpace inflation.\nFalling median household incomes during the Great Recession decreased the margin between tuition and income, making Purdue more expensive.\nTo combat this, the university implemented a frozen tuition policy in 2013 to keep tuition and fees at the 2012 level, locking in tuition and fees at around $10,000 for in-state students and $29,000 for out-of-state students.\n\u201cIn this period of national economic stagnation, it\u2019s time for us to hit the pause button on tuition increases,\u201d then-Purdue University President Mitch Daniels said when he announced the policy in 2013. \u201cOur students and their families deserve a high-value education that they can afford. We will fit our spending to their budgets \u2014 not the other way around.\u201d\nWhen adjusted to 2021 dollars, the cost of tuition and fees in 2021 nearly returned to the 2003 level because of the frozen tuition policy, making Purdue one of the most affordable universities in the Big Ten.\nIn February 2023, the Purdue University Board of Trustees renewed the tuition freeze for the 12th consecutive year, keeping tuition and fees for Purdue students at the 2012 level through the 2024-2025 academic year.\nUniversity of Nebraska is consistently one of the most affordable Big Ten schools\n\n\n\nWhile Nebraska\u2019s yearly costs are some of the lowest in the Big Ten, both in-state and out-of-state tuition are slightly outpacing inflation each year. \nAdjusted to 2021 dollars, in-state tuition increased by about $3,500 and out-of-state tuition increased by more than $11,000 from 2003 to 2021. That\u2019s $2,000 more than the Big Ten average in-state increase but about the same as the average out-of-state increase.\nEven with increasing prices that are outpacing inflation, Nebraska\u2019s tuition costs are well below average in the Big Ten. \nIn 2003, in-state tuition was about half of the Big Ten average at around $4,000 and out-of-state tuition was more than $7,000 less than the average. Nebraska\u2019s low tuition continued through 2021, when in-state tuition was nearly $4,000 less than the Big Ten average and out-of-state tuition was more than $11,000 less.\nOn March 3, University of Nebraska President Ted Carter testified to the Nebraska Legislature Appropriations Committee on the university\u2019s budget request for the upcoming academic years.\nCarter acknowledged financial challenges facing the university, including 40-year-high inflation, employment costs, upkeep expenses and declining enrollment, but vowed to overcome these obstacles.\n\u201cWe intend to remain on solid financial footing, even with new challenges ahead,\u201d Carter testified. \u201cWe are going to have the tough conversations necessary so we don\u2019t become one of those universities [predicted to] operate in the red.\u201d\nCarter also expressed continued commitment to affordability for students at the university.\n\u201cWe will not balance our budget on the backs of students \u2026 accessibility for Nebraskans is a fundamental part of our mission and a key factor in students\u2019 decision to enroll,\u201d Carter said.\nUniversity of Maryland follows the Big Ten trend\n\n\n\nAt Maryland, in-state tuition levels increased slightly since 2003, but out-of-state tuition has outpaced inflation considerably.\nAdjusted to 2021 dollars, Maryland\u2019s in-state tuition increased by about $2,000 between 2003 and 2021, about $500 more than the Big Ten average. Its out-of-state tuition increased by more than $15,000 during this period, nearly $3,000 more than the Big Ten average increase.\nIn January 2023, Maryland implemented the Terrapin Commitment, a need-based financial aid program to help offset the costs of tuition. However, only in-state students are eligible for the program.\n\u201cEvery Maryland student deserves an equal opportunity to attend the state\u2019s flagship university, and the Terrapin Commitment grant is one more measure we are taking to ensure that a University of Maryland education is affordable to all residents of our state,\u201d University of Maryland President Darryll Pines said in a statement.\nFor out-of-state students \u2014 who have seen much higher tuition increases than in-state students \u2014 there is not a program similar to the Terrapin Commitment. \n\nMethodology:\nBig Ten university tuition data was compiled from the Common Data Set, a report that includes important figures on universities\u2019 tuition, attendance and admission rates, and from universities\u2019 historical tuition data. The annual Common Data Set includes tuition estimates for the following academic year, meaning final tuition and fees for each academic year can be slightly different from the estimates published in the Common Data Set. A list of sources used in this report can be found here.\nNational median household income data was accessed from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nFigures collected from the Common Data Set and Census Bureau were adjusted to 2021 dollars using the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator.",

    "summary": "Maryland Delegate Karen Toles has introduced HB1105, proposing an elective water safety and swimming course for public school students in grades 8-12 to address high drowning rates among minority children. The bill aims to offer the course as a physical education credit and potentially open opportunities for lifeguarding jobs and college recruitment in competitive swimming.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Of the many bills in this year\u2019s legislative session set to make changes to education in Maryland, one stands out: a bill that would develop a water safety and swimming curriculum for high school-aged students.\nDel. Karen Toles, D-Prince George\u2019s, is the main sponsor of HB1105, which would require the State Board of Education to establish an elective course for public school students in grades 8-12 that would teach them the basics of swimming and water safety.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is a huge issue, particularly in the Black community, that more minority kids drown from not knowing how to swim than any other group of individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that we should look at, which gave me the idea to put something like this forward.\u201d\nToles also noted that many Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Howard and Hampton made sure kids knew how to swim before they could graduate, which is something she took into consideration when coming up with the bill.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional death for children ages 17 and below. In children aged 10-14, Black children drown at 7.6 times the rate that white children do in swimming pools.\nThe bill suggests public middle or high schools offering this course partner with a local parks and recreation agency to connect them with the pool and facilities needed in order to successfully teach it.\n\u201cI drafted the bill to say that you can use (it) as a physical education credit, and having it during middle school and high school, they actually get credit for physical education,\u201d said Toles. The idea has the added benefit of possible lifeguarding jobs down the road for students successfully completing the course.\u00a0\nThe delegate also said she would like to see more competitive swimming programs lead to recruitments to colleges and universities. Having a program that teaches teenagers swimming and water safety skills increases the opportunities for them to be a part of a competitive swim team.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is important to our community that has been underrepresented and has been underserved for far too long in order to be able to bring quality swimming opportunities to our communities in Maryland, as well as to continue to promote water safety and drowning prevention,\u201d said Nicholas Askew, head coach and director of Swimming and Diving at Howard University, in testimony on the bill before the House Ways and Means Committee March 8.\nDr. William Ramos, member of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council, said that one unique thing about HB1105 is that it targets high-school-aged children, while typically this type of legislation is targeted at younger kids.\n\u201cWe start seeing teen boys drowning at higher rates around those grades, so it\u2019s an important and intervention piece,\u201d he said. \u201cOften I think we forget about the older kids, assuming they got something when they were younger, but many don\u2019t.\u201d\nIf the bill passes, local boards of education would have to implement the course beginning in the 2025-2026 school year.\n\u201cThis bill is a step, a huge step in being able to have a solution to this public health crisis,\u201d said Askew. \u201cMany of our communities are around waterways, many of our children will try to enjoy different areas around pools and splash parks, and it is our obligation as adults to be able to provide them with the safest opportunities as possible.\u201d\nSome Maryland public schools already offer some sort of water safety program to students. Charles County Public Schools, for example, has fifth graders watch a video from the Red Cross about water safety, discuss good conduct to have around bodies of water, and take a field trip to a nearby pool for a day of water activities.\u00a0\n\u201cLearning to swim and having those skills certainly has a buffering effect on drowning, but it also opens amazing opportunities for people to use the water right for recreation and leisure therapy,\u201d said Ramos. \u201cBut if we think of swim lessons as the only cure, by the time a child has to use their swim skills to rescue themselves or perhaps somebody else, they\u2019ve missed the smarts part, so we want to start by teaching people how to make sure they don\u2019t get into these situations.\u201d\nFifth graders in Anne Arundel County Public Schools participate in a Drownproofing Program, where they learn personal water safety skills as a part of the physical education and language arts curriculum.\u00a0\nToles told Capital News Service that her home county also offers a water safety program for its elementary schoolers.\u00a0\n\u201cWe do have that program where they\u2019re taking second graders out for a few days and teaching them how to swim after they\u2019ve had their water safety course,\u201d she said.\nThe American Red Cross has a whole page on its website dedicated to its water safety and aquatic resources, training, and information.\nMore and more jurisdictions are producing legislation concerning water safety, including some that put students in the pool, Ramos said.\nRamos also clarified the difference between just teaching kids to swim, versus teaching them water safety. Water safety is preventative \u2013 learning how to be smart around bodies of water so kids don\u2019t get into positions where they then have to rely on their swimming and water skills. But swimming skills are also necessary so that children can get to a safe place in the event of an emergency.\nThe bill has bipartisan support: One of the 23 sponsoring delegates is Republican Rachel Munoz, R-Anne Arundel.\u00a0\n\u201cWe definitely need to focus on equity and inclusion when it comes to kids learning how to swim,\u201d said Toles.",

    "summary": "Maryland Governor Wes Moore's proposed service year program for high school graduates draws inspiration from existing initiatives like the Service Year Alliance, aiming to foster civic engagement and personal growth. The plan, which includes the creation of a new department focused on civic and service innovation, seeks to connect young people with paid opportunities to contribute to their communities in various ways.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 While details of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore\u2019s service year option for high school graduates are still being worked out, there are many other existing service year programs in the state, nationally and worldwide that allow people to gain the experience and give back to the community in the way Moore wants.\nThe governor has made service one of his top priorities this term, signing an executive order creating the Maryland Department of Civic and Service Innovation on his first full day in office. Moore\u2019s proposed plan for Maryland so far is a unique combination of the service year programs that have come before it.\nOne such program is Service Year Alliance, whose board chair, retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, joined Moore for his testimony in front of the Senate\u2019s Education, Energy and the Environment Committee on Feb. 22.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be here because Maryland is on the verge of doing something really special that I\u2019ve been involved with for more than a decade,\u201d McChrystal said. \u201cTo me, service is not just an opportunity to get certain tasks done in the state or in the nation\u2014we can hire people for that. We cannot hire people to be good citizens, we have to make them, we have to mold them, we\u2019ve got to give every young American that opportunity.\u201d\nThat molding of young citizens is the idea behind both Moore\u2019s Service Year and the Service Year Alliance program. The Alliance runs an online website that connects young people looking to serve their communities with paid opportunities to do so, according to Kristen Bennett, Alliance CEO. It serves a range of people, from high school graduates to GED recipients to college grads to those who are mid-career looking to gain experience. Participants can end up helping clean up from natural disasters, tutoring, rebuilding homes, helping with conservation projects, and many other opportunities.\nOn serviceyear.org, interested participants fill out a profile about themselves and their interests, as well as time periods and locations where they are available. Based on this information, the platform suggests matches for organizations and opportunities, and participants can then apply to what interests them.\n\u201cOne of the things that we are always trying to put front and center is that there\u2019s not one way to do a service year, there really are a lot of different opportunities,\u201d Bennett said..\nWhile Service Year Alliance does not directly host service participants, it partners with other groups like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps to link interested individuals with service opportunities. It was formed in 2016, and has over 225,000 users on the platform.\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, it\u2019s like applying for any other job; one of the reasons we created serviceyear.org is because the opportunities to serve are with thousands of organizations across the country, and there wasn\u2019t really one place to find all of them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we wanted to do was make it approachable.\u201d\nParticipating in a service year program also increases the likelihood of someone returning to school and earning a degree, the Alliance has found.\n\u201cWe have seen that those who participate in service year programs without a bachelor\u2019s degree are over twice as likely than their peers to go and earn a bachelor\u2019s degree (after their service year),\u201d said Bennett. An Alliance report from 2018 showed that 24% of service year alum who served without a bachelor\u2019s degree went on to earn one, as compared to just 11% of their peers who went on to achieve a bachelor\u2019s after two years of full-time work.\nAnother youth service organization is Youth Service America, a group that helps kids and young people ages 5-25 get involved in giving back to their communities. It was founded in 1986, and has engaged over 3.2 million young people in service in the last decade.\n\u201cOur biggest strategy is what we call the ask. We know that most young people volunteer for the first time because someone that they know asked them to,\u201d said Karen Daniel, vice president of programs at YSA. \u201cWe really work hard to make sure that all young people are invited to serve and we know that not all young people are asked to serve at the same rates.\u201d\nSimilar is the National Youth Leadership Council, whose goal since its founding in 1983, is to help young people become civically engaged and informed through serving learning, in the hopes of creating a more \u201cjust, sustainable and peaceful world.\u201d The group strengthens the sustainability of service learning opportunities in organizations and schools, as well as increases the quality of the service opportunities.\n\u201cThe benefit of quality service learning is that there are actual outcomes for the students as well as the community,\u201d said Amy Meuers, chief executive officer of NYLC. \u201cWe see increases in engagement, we see development of academic skills and investment in student success through service learning.\u201d\nOther national organizations dedicated to offering service opportunities are AmeriCorps, which has been around since 1993, the Peace Corps, founded in 1961, Teach for America, established in 1990, and the more recent Report for America, started in 2017, among others.\nWorldwide, there are organizations such as the Republic of the Philippines\u2019 National Youth Commission, and South Africa\u2019s National Youth Service Programme. Both aim to help combat issues affecting youth in their respective countries.\nNYC was created in 1995 with the mission of promoting sustainable programs and policies that benefit Filipino youth. One of the things it offers is a Government Internship Program, which started out as a summer work program for students, where unemployed and out-of-school youth are hired as interns and are paid a monthly stipend.\nNYDA, the parent of the National Youth Service Programme, was created by an act of South Africa\u2019s Parliament in 2008 for the purpose of addressing issues faced by the youth in the nation. It offers a variety of programs, such as entrepreneurship grants, business management training and a jobs program, which helps young people get connected with opportunities they have skills for.\nElements of all of these programs can be seen in Maryland\u2019s Serving Every Region Through Vocational Exploration Act of 2023, or HB546, which was introduced Feb. 2, on behalf of the Moore administration. The bill establishes and funds the Service Year Option, and has bipartisan support. Its Senate counterpart is SB551.\nUnder the act, participants would be placed in a service job for a minimum of 30 hours a week, paid $15 an hour by their employer, and receive mentorship and job training. According to the bill, the service job may be in the public or private sector, but no other specifics have been outlined.\nOther things that have yet to be established are what year the program would be available to potential participants, who will be leading the new department or what other positions need to be filled in the department.\nMoore testified at both the House hearing in the Appropriations Committee on Feb. 21, and the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee on Feb. 22.\n\u201cI believe deeply that all the challenges that our state and all the challenges that our nation are facing, that it is going to be service that is going to help to save us,\u201d Moore told the House committee in his testimony. \u201cFrom the first day of my administration, I have worked to make Maryland a state of service, and it is a mission that all of us collectively are on.\u201d\nThe program would be open to high school graduates and those who have an equivalent degree. The new department is in charge of the design and administration of the program, as well as creating a statewide network of participants and promoting the program to potential participants and employers.\n\u201cThe Service Year Option established by this bill will provide young people of every background and of every jurisdiction all throughout the state the opportunity to serve our state while also gaining real-world perspectives, skills and experience,\u201d Moore said.\nThis is not the first time the state of Maryland has expanded access to service. In 2016, HB1488 established the Maryland Corps, and was signed by former Gov. Larry Hogan in May of that year. The program aimed to provide service opportunities that addressed community needs across the state for at least 100 participants. Though a bill that expanded and revised the program passed the General Assembly last year, both the chair and executive director positions remain vacant.\nMoore\u2019s executive order establishing a state department to oversee service and civic engagement makes Maryland one of just a few other states to have these cabinet-level agencies. For example, in California, the state office California Volunteers, led by the state\u2019s Chief Service Officer Josh Fryday, helps to oversee Californians\u2019 civic engagement, service and volunteering.\n\u201cHaving a dedicated state agency is a powerful way to value the importance of service in our democratic society,\u201d said Fryday. \u201cGovernor Gavin Newsom is a strong proponent of service, elevating the position of California Chief Service Officer to Cabinet-level and investing millions into creating more opportunities. Under Governor Newsom\u2019s leadership, California Volunteers has been focused on creating more paid-service opportunities to tackle California\u2019s biggest challenges, such as pandemic-related education loss, food insecurity and the climate crisis. We are thrilled by Governor Moore\u2019s leadership to double down on the power of service, and know Maryland will benefit greatly as a result.\u201d\nSome of California Volunteers\u2019 programs include College Corps, which partners with campuses across the state to allow students to earn money to help pay for their education by placing them in community-based organizations to do service, Youth Jobs Corps, which partners with local governments and community organizations to provide jobs and job trainings to underserved youth and AmeriCorps.\n\u201cWe often describe service as a win-win-win. For individuals, they build connections, develop leadership skills, and gain valuable work experience. For the community, service builds connections between individuals of different beliefs, backgrounds and life experiences \u2013 helping to bridge divides in our too often polarized society. And for the whole state, we are investing in the next generation of leaders to address our greatest challenges,\u201d Fryday said. \u201cWe know service shapes lives and changes communities.\u201d\nHowever, some Republicans are unhappy with the way the Department of Civic and Service Innovation is being established so far in Maryland. According to a Feb. 22 press release from the Maryland Senate Republican Caucus, Republicans want more transparency on the department, and the ability to work with the governor on its creation.\nA secretary for this department has yet to be named by the Moore administration, something Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore City, indicated in a news conference on Friday that the legislature was anxiously awaiting in order to move forward with the service year priority.\n\u201cFrom my perspective as the president of the Senate it is essential that all of the secretaries be named and up for consideration for the Senate by the time we leave session,\u201d said Ferguson.\nDespite these concerns, Moore is dedicated to making Maryland a state of service.\n\u201cService will help to save us, because it will help us get to know each other better,\u201d Moore said. \u201cService will give each person an opportunity to actually spend time with others who have a shared and a common understanding and who make sure that their fingerprints are on the future of this state.\u201d\nThis story has been corrected to fix the name of the website serviceyear.org.",

    "summary": "ChatGPT's introduction has prompted University of Maryland professors to reconsider their teaching methods and assessment criteria, emphasizing deeper understanding and practical application over surface-level knowledge. Professors are exploring how to integrate AI tools like ChatGPT into education, drawing parallels with the initial concerns over calculators in classrooms.",
    "content": "As the use of artificial intelligence in various industries continues to increase, the impact of OpenAI\u2019s language model ChatGPT on higher education has become increasingly significant.\nAt least, that\u2019s the line ChatGPT produced after it was prompted by CNS to write the lead of an article about its own influence on higher education. Although vague and unengaging, it\u2019s not incorrect.\nSince its release on Nov. 30, 2022, ChatGPT has been making headlines as an impressive chat bot powered by artificial intelligence (AI) with the capability to synthesize eerily human writing and dialogue.\u00a0\nChatGPT is the latest experiment born from the same AI research and development company that recently produced DALL-E 2, the AI image generator whose works can mimic the likes of Monet. OpenAI created ChatGPT via deep learning; programmers first combined the bot with an immense swath of text pulled from the internet, then used both human supervision and automated systems to train the system on how to respond to prompts using the text.\u00a0\nIt rocketed into the public consciousness, and the program set a record for the fastest-growing user base in history with 100 million users in January, Reuters reported. Educators have been left to consider its place in the classroom and its capacity for plagiarism.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom an educational perspective, it\u2019s perhaps an opportunity to reconsider how we assess student learning and student progress,\u201d University of Maryland computer science professor Hal Daum\u00e9 said.\u00a0\nSince ChatGPT can easily replicate basic understanding of certain concepts, Daum\u00e9 said he\u2019s been inputting his own assignment questions into the program to see if he needs to make them more difficult. He\u2019s not as interested in surface level responses, from students using ChatGPT or not.\u00a0\n\u201cI care that they understand this high-level concept, and I care that they can translate that into an implementation,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHe compared the recent release of ChatGPT to that of the calculator. At the time, there was a similar hysteria amongst educators concerned that computers would replace the need for students to learn foundational skills. While calculators are now universally used, mathematics professors still have their jobs.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in thinking about how we can teach students to use these tools responsibly,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nSeveral school districts, including Montgomery County and Baltimore County in Maryland, have banned the program outright. On the other hand, NPR reported an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania has incorporated it into their curriculum, and Daum\u00e9 mentioned a linguistics professor at the University of Maryland who has done the same.\u00a0\n\nDaum\u00e9 did imagine instances where it may make sense for a ban on ChatGPT, like in introductory classes that require assessments on entry-level concepts. He also aired its flaws: the program draws language from websites without attribution, and besides that, it\u2019s frequently inaccurate.\u00a0\nVirginia Byrne, an assistant professor in the School of Education and Urban Studies at Morgan State University, echoed the calculator analogy.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned how to teach with these technologies to help us instead of assuming the worst in people,\u201d Byrne said.\u00a0\nShe agreed that plagiarism using ChatGPT is a valid issue, but said that making assessments more creative could circumvent these concerns. Instead of an essay, consider having students make a podcast, presentation or demonstrate experiential learning, she suggested.\u00a0\nChatGPT has been proven to pass a law school exam, a high school chemistry exam and an AP English essay (although, it seems its chess strategy could use some work), and has quickly become a popular method of academic dishonesty. According to a poll by The Stanford Daily, 17% of Stanford students admitted to using ChatGPT in some capacity on their assignments and exams.\u00a0\nByrne cautioned against improper uses of ChatGPT by administration, citing the recent Vanderbilt University scandal in which the school used the language model to write a community email regarding the Michigan State University shooting. She voiced concerns that the clamor surrounding ChatGPT could elicit overreactions from professors.\n\u201cThere\u2019s concern that ChatGPT being out in the world will fuel some people\u2019s discriminatory accusations of cheating, against particularly people whose first language isn\u2019t English\u2026 That\u2019s why we want to lower the hysteria about plagiarism. And remember that people don\u2019t go to college just to cheat; that\u2019s not why our students are here,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nApril Logan, an associate professor in the Department of English at Salisbury University, read about ChatGPT in campus emails describing the pitfalls of the program and how to navigate concerns of plagiarism.\u00a0\nLogan conceded that the program presents a real temptation for students to cut corners, especially first generation students or those rundown and stressed that may be feeling overwhelmed.\u00a0\n\u201cHere we have just one more system or software that makes it easy for them to maybe not make the best choice,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nLike Byrne, she mentioned underlying biases in faculty could lead to more unfounded accusations of plagiarism, but she also questioned the biases built into ChatGPT itself. Could it be drawing from mostly Western, eurocentric texts, she wondered? In any case, Logan found it a bit lacking.\u00a0\n\u201cIt did seem a little soulless. And it was very, very general. What I\u2019m really interested in helping my students learn to do is to not be general; to be specific in their writing, to think critically, to go in depth.\u201d Logan said.\u00a0\nAs far as writing instruction, Logan said ChatGPT could be a great tool for showing students the impact of authorial voice and the difference between summary and analysis. She likened the program\u2019s output to the James Brown song \u201cTalkin\u2019 Loud and Sayin\u2019 Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cChatGPT is very seductive because from a technical standpoint, it\u2019s well written. But is it actually giving us some real information or real meat?\u201d\nLooking to the future, Logan wondered about the possibilities language AI offers to education and to the literary world.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not just afraid, but curious to see where it goes. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019m confident in my colleagues and the University System of Maryland, we\u2019re up to the challenge.\u201d",

    "summary": "Despite the high risk of problem gambling among college students and the prevalence of sports betting advertisements on campuses, only 23% of surveyed Division I public universities have published policies addressing sports betting. Policies vary widely, with some banning on-campus betting or prohibiting student-athletes from gambling, but few address off-campus activities.",
    "content": "College students are in the highest risk group for problem gambling, yet universities have been slow to create policies, educational programs or restrictions on sports betting, according to a survey by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.\nThat\u2019s despite the aggressive expansion of sports gambling and abundant advertising at some college campuses \u2014 on scoreboards and banners at athletic events, on academic buildings and even in campus emails.\nThe Povich and Howard centers asked 145 Division I public universities in the states where sports betting is legal to share their campus policies addressing gambling. The centers could only confirm that 23% had published sports betting policies.\nMary Drexler, program director for the Maryland Center of Excellence on Problem Gambling at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said young adults \u201care at a higher risk \u2026 for developing a problem\u201d with gambling.\n\u201cWe would like to see more colleges and universities, if they don\u2019t have a policy, [to] develop a policy,\u201d Drexler said.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nAmong the universities that responded and have addressed gambling, bans on betting are rare.\nPurdue University prohibits betting on Purdue sports. Stony Brook University in New York advises students that they may not gamble for money or other valuables on university property or in university facilities except as part of an authorized fundraising activity, essentially banning on-campus wagering.\nOther policies don\u2019t address differences between sports bets placed on or off campus. Some only address state law, while some prohibit gambling by student-athletes, based on NCAA policy.\nKeith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, said college students\u2019 vulnerability to sports betting could be linked to a variety of factors, including interest in sports, belief in one\u2019s own skill and the underdevelopment of the brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex, which helps control impulsive behavior but isn\u2019t fully developed until age 25.\nStelianos Canallatos, prevention manager for the New York Council on Problem Gambling, said he would advise colleges to prohibit gambling entirely since the legal age for gambling in most states is 21 and surveys show a majority of students at four-year universities are 21 and younger.\nIn studies conducted from 2007 to 2014, researchers found that 75% to 80% of college students had gambled in the past year. Opportunities to bet have expanded since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to sports betting in 2018.\nThe ruling of the Supreme Court left it to each state to decide whether to allow legal bets on sports events. According to the American Gambling Association, sports betting is legal in 36 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe growth in betting has been explosive. Bettors wagered more than $57 billion on sports in 2021, according to the American Gambling Association, and college sports draw a big share of gamblers\u2019 money. For example, in Colorado, bettors wagered more than $170 million on college basketball in February and March 2022, when conference and national tournaments are played.\nSportsbooks, which take in bets and pay out winnings, have marketed their platforms heavily and made deals with universities across the country.\n\nUniversities and their Sports Betting Deals\nCaesars Sportsbook, PointsBet USA and other betting companies are seeking a marketing edge in agreements to promote their brands on college campuses.\nBy Matthew Wynn\n\n\n\n\n\n \nmarylandLSUMichiganStatecoloradouniversityofdenverUniversityofNevadaLasVegasUniversity of Nevada Reno \n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan State University and Louisiana State University have deals with Caesars Sportsbook, and the University of Maryland and University of Colorado Boulder have deals with PointsBet.\nThe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has a contract with DraftKings that includes an on-campus gaming innovation studio bearing the company\u2019s name.\nThe four schools partnered with PointsBet and Caesars have agreements that go beyond ads in stadiums and on broadcasts. A campus-wide email campaign from Caesars targeted anyone on LSU Athletics\u2019 email list, offering free bets for an initial wager. PointsBet has a banner ad that has shown up on the Maryland Athletics website\u2019s homepage, one displaying a hook offering $500 in free bets.\nThe University of Colorado Boulder released details of an agreement negotiated with the sportsbook PointsBet in response to a public information request from the Povich and Howard centers. It included a $30 referral fee \u2014 since discontinued \u2014 to be paid to the university when someone used Colorado\u2019s promo code to sign up, deposited money and placed a bet.\n\nIn November, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut,, wrote a letter to Caesars CEO Tom Reeg criticizing Caesars\u2019 advertising on college campuses.\n\u201cI call on you to end this disgraceful practice in order to protect students and prevent the irreparable harm that will be caused by Caesars\u2019 marketing practices and college partnerships,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.\nThe American Gambling Association, an industry lobbying group, publishes a \u201cResponsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering,\u201d which member companies agree to follow.\nThe code says, \u201cSports wagering advertisements should not be placed in media outlets (including social media) that appeal primarily to those below the legal age for sports wagering, nor should they be displayed at an event venue where most of the audience at many of the events at the venue is reasonably expected to be below the legal age for sports wagering.\u201d\nThe code also says sports betting should not be advertised or promoted on campus.\nNeither Caesars nor PointsBet is a member of the AGA. Both companies have advertised during games \u2014 Caesars at LSU and Michigan State, PointsBet at the University of Maryland and Colorado.\nTom McMillen, a former Maryland congressman who played basketball at the University of Maryland and in the NBA, told the Povich and Howard centers that he sees gambling as a danger to college athletics.\nHe said there is a \u201c100% probability\u201d that a major sports betting scandal will occur one day.\n\n\u201cA gambling scandal \u2026 will subsume everything else good about the university.\u201d\n\u2014 Tom McMillen, former U.S. representative and former NBA player\n\nThere\u2019s already evidence that, despite an NCAA prohibition, college athletes bet on sports. A 2017 study showed that 24% of NCAA male athletes bet on sports and 13% reported in-game betting, a type of bet that is more susceptible to what the NCAA calls \u201cspot fixing,\u201d in which a particular play, not the entire game, is fixed to satisfy betting odds.\nAt Purdue, faculty, students and staff have been banned from betting on Purdue sports teams since 2019, though sports betting is legal in Indiana.\nFormer Purdue University President Mitch Daniels acknowledged enforcement is difficult. But in a November email to the Povich and Howard centers, he said the policy \u201cseems to have been accepted university wide.\u201d\n\u201cNo complaints. No allegations. No enforcement actions,\u201d wrote Daniels, who stepped down in December. \u201cWe hope it stays that way.\u201d\nMcMillen doubts it will.\n\u201cWhen it happens, when you do have a scandal, the president of the university will be flayed across the [newspaper],\u201d McMillen said. \u201cA gambling scandal \u2026 will subsume everything else good about the university.\u201d\nVictoria Ifatusin contributed to this story.\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

    "content": "College campuses increasingly are striking deals with sports betting companies eager to promote their brands in stadiums, on radio broadcasts and on athletic department websites \u2014 places where they can be seen and heard by students. But the terms of those agreements are opaque despite the high-dollar and societal stakes.\nLouisiana State University, Michigan State University and the University of Maryland have made their agreements through third-party companies, firms set up to sell sports sponsorships on behalf of the schools. That means the agreements can be shielded from public view; open records laws don\u2019t apply to privately held companies.\nThat lack of transparency concerns gambling addiction experts and others already troubled by the impact of legalized sports betting on college campuses.\n\u201cAnytime that you can\u2019t be transparent about something you\u2019re doing, it probably indicates that there are some issues,\u201d said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. \u201cThese colleges should be very concerned about the impact of gambling addiction among especially underage students.\u201d\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nMaryland Del. Jared Solomon, D-Montgomery County, vice chair of the Education and Economic Development Subcommittee, said he was unaware of the third-party deals and wanted to hear from university officials about why the sports betting contract for the University of Maryland isn\u2019t available to the public.\n\u201cAs a policymaker and a taxpayer, I would like to know what agreements our system is entering into that are going to have an impact on our students and are going to have an impact on the bottom line of the university,\u201d Solomon said.\nAs part of a four-month investigation into sports betting on college campuses, The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland sought contracts from LSU, Michigan State and three other universities known to have sports betting brands as sponsors:\n\u2022 University of Colorado Boulder\n\u2022 University of Denver\n\u2022 University of Maryland\nAll but the University of Denver are public universities and therefore are subject to open records requests under public information laws.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada, Reno, each had a sponsorship deal with sports betting company William Hill. Those agreements with the company, which was acquired by Caesars Sportsbook in 2021, have ended.\nBoth Nevada schools continue to have betting partners, however. UNLV is allied with DraftKings in a branding deal that includes an on-campus gaming innovation studio. At the University of Nevada, Reno, a local casino hosts the weekly radio broadcasts of the men\u2019s basketball and football coaches.\n\n\u201cThese colleges should be very concerned about the impact of gambling addiction among especially underage students.\u201d\n\u2014 Keith Whyte, National Council on Problem Gambling executive director\n\nOf the five schools with the most extensive ties to sports betting brands, only CU Boulder released its agreement in response to a public records request from the Povich and Howard centers. Most of the others replied that they did not have deals with sports betting companies.\nHowever, in January 2022, Michigan State Athletics announced its deal with Caesars Sportsbook in a press release. A month earlier, Maryland announced a deal with betting platform PointsBet under the headline, \u201cPointsBet Named Official Partner of University of Maryland Athletics.\u201d\nThe betting companies made their deals not with the schools but with private sports marketing companies aligned with the schools, according to officials at Michigan State and Maryland.\nMichigan State, Maryland and LSU are represented by sports marketing company Playfly Sports, the \u201cmarketing and multimedia rights holder for some of the most prestigious collegiate teams, high school state associations and sports venues across the country,\u201d according to the company website.\nPlayfly did not respond to interview requests from the Povich and Howard centers.\nLike Learfield, another large sports marketing firm, Playfly represents high-profile college sports programs often selling sponsorship deals to become \u201cofficial partners.\u201d\nSports marketing companies Playfly and Learfield take the risk, although they can make back their investment and more if they close enough lucrative deals. Athletic departments also benefit because they can count on a set payment from a marketing company each year.\nSome privately held sports marketing companies create other private companies organized to only handle the deals with the campuses. For example, PointsBet\u2019s \u201cofficial partner\u201d deal with Maryland is instead with Maryland Sports Properties, a private company created by Playfly. Maryland Sports Properties negotiates all marketing and media rights for the university\u2019s athletics program.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhen the Povich and Howard centers requested the PointsBet agreement from Maryland Sports Properties, General Manager Jack Krabbe replied in an email that Maryland Sports Properties was not required to share it.\nLSU and Michigan State also declined requests for their agreements. LSU stated that the university is \u201cnot a custodian\u201d of the contract. Michigan State responded to the request with the school\u2019s multimedia rights contract with FOX Sports, an agreement that the Povich and Howard centers hadn\u2019t asked for. Michigan State never provided its sports betting agreement.\nMaryland also did not release its contract. A public records officer told the Povich and Howard centers, \u201cAthletics has confirmed that UMD does not have an agreement with PointsBet,\u201d even though the university refers to PointsBet as an \u201cofficial partner\u201d of Maryland Athletics.\nRebecca Snyder, executive director of the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association, a nonprofit that advocates for public access to government and other records, said, \u201cSports betting is a huge industry, and the public needs to understand how that\u2019s affecting their publicly funded universities. I think it\u2019s very convenient that there are no public records.\u201d\nBrian Ullmann, the University of Maryland\u2019s vice president for marketing and communications, said the relationship between Maryland Athletics and PointsBet \u201cis not a contract between the university and sponsor. It\u2019s a contract between Playfly and a sponsor.\u201d\nIn all, Playfly has signed approximately 63 sponsorship deals for Maryland, according to Ullmann, who added the university has four other sponsorship deals that were signed directly with the university. Those include agreements with Pepsi and Under Armour, he said.\nThough a private company, Maryland Sports Properties has a close relationship with the university. Maryland Sports Properties has an office at Xfinity Center, the athletic venue where many Terps sports teams play and where coaches and sports administrators have offices. The familiar red \u201cM\u201d of Maryland Athletics is on the door of the Maryland Sports Properties offices.\nThe firm\u2019s employees also have university email addresses. In October, at least four, including Krabbe, had accounts listed in the university directory ending in \u201cumd.edu.\u201d\nUllmann said he was unaware the workers had university-issued email addresses. Asked why employees of a privately held company would have Maryland accounts, he said Maryland Sports Properties employees would\u2019ve been issued umd.edu emails \u201cin order to access systems, including COVID compliance requirements.\u201d\nSolomon, the Maryland legislator, said he would like more details on the University of Maryland contract and hoped that release of the sports betting agreement \u201cwould not rise to the level of requiring legislation.\u201d\nSolomon added, \u201cThis is the kind of thing that I hope with a conversation and some publicity around it, people would do the right thing.\u201d\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

The initiative, funded by a grant from the National Council on Problem Gambling, targets a vulnerable age group where addictive behaviors often emerge.",
    "content": "When Towson University students pick up their phones on campus and open a designated app, they may see an ad seeking to teach them about responsible gambling.\nThe in-app banner ad, sent at random, advises them to \u201cPAWS\u201d: \u201cPlan ahead, Always know your limits, Wait to play again/wager again, Stop while you\u2019re ahead.\u201d\nWith this marketing campaign, Towson is stepping in front of a trend: explosive growth of sports betting across the U.S., including on college campuses.\nIn studies conducted from 2007 to 2014, researchers found that 75% to 80% of college students had gambled in the previous year. Opportunities to bet have expanded since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to sports betting in 2018.\nA grant from the National Council on Problem Gambling has helped the Baltimore-area college create what it hopes will become a national model for what a university can do to help its students.\n\u201cThe hope and the goal [is] that we can really develop some incredible work that sets the standard for other universities to tackle this topic,\u201d said Jaclyn Webber of the university\u2019s Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Prevention Center. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of evidence-based information out there about gambling prevention.\u201d\n[ Read more stories from \u201cGambling on Campus\u201d ]\nKeith Whyte, executive director of the problem gambling council, said his organization selected Towson for the grant because \u201cwe believe that preventing high-risk populations was the area that had the least amount of funding and could make the biggest impact.\u201d\nJoshua B. Grubbs, a professor of psychology at Bowling Green State University who studies addiction, said college students \u201care at that age group where we start to really begin to see addictive tendencies emerge.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to drive fast and get speeding tickets, you\u2019re more likely to try illicit substances, you\u2019re more likely to binge drink, right? You\u2019re also more likely to try gambling,\u201d Grubbs said, referring to the vulnerabilities of young adult men. \u201cBecause of that, you\u2019re more likely to encounter something that you may later develop an addiction to.\u201d\nTowson University is implementing a program, \u201cTigers Play Responsibly,\u201d that seeks to educate students through robust anti-problem gambling workshops and marketing campaigns.\nFunded by the National Council on Problem Gambling\u2019s $40,000 Agility Grant, educators work tables at sporting events, conduct giveaways, maintain a messaging campaign on social media and geo-target mobile advertising to students at sporting events or near sports venues with messages designed to prevent problem gambling. In partnership with Towson\u2019s athletics program, the \u201cTigers Play Responsibly\u201d ad campaign also is featured in athletics publications and on bus panels near athletics sites.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that the school provides it,\u201d said Peter Ariano, a Towson senior and frequent sports gambler. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that\u2019s a dire need for colleges.\u201d\nSusan Foss, a parent of a 23-year-old who gambles, said, \u201cI think anytime you can reach even a small segment of the population, it\u2019s valid.\u201d\nBut not everyone has faith in the service\u2019s ability to reach and assist dedicated gamblers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any Towson student is going to listen to an outreach on responsible sports betting,\u201d said Mike Koanang, a Towson senior and frequent sports bettor. \u201cI think they\u2019re just going to go with their flow \u2014 whatever has been making them win money.\u201d\nThere are limits to what can be achieved by the nascent program at Towson. It has a relatively small pool of funds and a short time frame to work with. The grant expires in March and the university must provide metrics showing success to get additional funds.\nEven if more money isn\u2019t forthcoming, Webber said the program has developed a \u201clot of material and lots of information\u201d that they can continue to use.\nEmily Wiegand, assistant director and manager of substance education, treatment and prevention services in Towson\u2019s Counseling Center, said few, if any, schools have a program of awareness and education as extensive as Towson\u2019s.\n\u201cWhen we were writing the grant, we did a pretty thorough search to see if other schools were doing things to try and get some ideas for our own application,\u201d Wiegand said. \u201cWe found a few schools that have a gambling screening available, but could not find any comprehensive gambling prevention programs along the lines of what we planned to develop here at Towson.\u201d\nJames P. Whelan, the director of The Institute for Gambling Education and Research at the University of Memphis, said he admires the work Towson has done. But its $40,000 grant is \u201ca drop in the bucket.\u201d\nFunding for problem gambling research and support is not consistent, Whelan said. None of the $7.6 billion in annual federal gambling tax revenue goes to help prevent or treat gambling addiction, according to the problem gambling council. Instead, research relies on how much money a state or institution is willing to allocate to the issues.\n\u201cIf Congress says, \u2018Hey, we need money to research gambling disorders,\u2019 then the money will be there. But they haven\u2019t done that,\u201d Grubbs said.\n\u201cIf Congress says, \u2018Hey, we need money to research gambling disorders,\u2019 then the money will be there. But they haven\u2019t done that.\u201d\n\u2014 Joshua B. Grubbs, Bowling Green State psychology professor\n\nPublic opinion is not driving additional spending. According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of adults say sports betting legalization is neither a good nor bad thing for society.\nOther universities have responded to sports betting changes by trying to influence legislation in hopes of distancing college sports betting from their campuses.\nPresidents of major universities in Virginia and Massachusetts sent letters to their respective state legislatures, urging them to oppose legislation they contend would create problems for students.\nIn Virginia, the legalization of betting on in-state college sports teams passed in the Senate of Virginia, but died in the House of Delegates.\n\u201cI would guess that the drivers [of the policy failing in the House] were influenced by the presidents,\u201d said Virginia state Sen. T. Montgomery \u201cMonty\u201d Mason. \u201cObviously presidents of colleges and universities should have a great deal of influence on any higher education policy.\u201d\nIn Massachusetts, seven school presidents and six athletics directors from universities ranging from Harvard to Merrimack College wrote a letter urging legislators to remove college sports betting from the proposed policy.\n\u201cBased on our years of experience, each of us believes that such legislation will create unnecessary and unacceptable risks to student athletes, their campus peers, and the integrity and culture of colleges and universities in the Commonwealth,\u201d university officials wrote.\nThis story was produced by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism.

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 While the teaching of Black history is under fire and facing censorship in some states like Florida, two Maryland lawmakers have proposed legislation aimed at providing more federal support to promote and preserve Black history, culture and education.\nRep. Kweisi Mfume and Sen. Ben Cardin, both Maryland Democrats, introduced their measures on Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month.\nThe legislation would create a council of 12 presidential appointees to advise the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) on promoting Black voices, ensuring that Black history and culture is recognized in schools, providing resources to preserve Black history, and recommending national policies that would generate improved public understanding of African American history and culture.\n\u201cAfrican American history is American history,\u201d Cardin said in a statement. \u201cFor too long our history lessons failed to fully acknowledge the role of Black Americans. And it happens in far more places than schools \u2013 so much of what we have learned for generations about history, music, culture and more has diminished the role of African American creators, writers, musicians and beyond.\u201d\n\u201cThis bill pushes back against the attacks on African American history in our schools and communities,\u201d Mfume said in a statement. \u201cWe must ensure that Black history is told fully and accurately in America. While the truth of our journey may not be the easiest to tell, it should be protected and celebrated because the story of African American people is intricate and integral to the story of the United States of America \u2013 that history must be treated and admired as such.\u201d\nSchool courses on African American history are generating political controversy. A new Advanced Placement African American studies course, which is currently being piloted across the country, has come under fire recently.\nGov. Ron DeSantis, R-Florida, and the Florida Department of Education attacked some of the topics being covered in the course, including so-called critical race theory and the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe AP course\u2019s official framework has since been revised. Supporters of Black history education claim that texts by scholars focusing on critical race theory have been removed from the course and that essential topics were left out. According to a statement from the College Board, however, no such changes were made.\n\u201cWe must also clarify that no Black scholars or authors have been removed from the course. In fact, contemporary scholars and authors are never mandated in any AP framework,\u201d the College Board said in a Feb. 8 letter to the Florida Department of Education.\nThe College Board also wrote that no topics were removed because \u201cthey lacked educational value.\u201d\nIn an updated statement on Feb. 11, the College Board said it should have been more clear about the framework and topics of the course, differentiated between the final curriculum and the early framework, and denounced the Florida Department of Education\u2019s \u201cslander\u201d of the course.\nThe course is being piloted in Maryland at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, part of Baltimore City Public Schools, and is one of only 60 schools in the country participating in the pilot program during the 2022-2023 school year.\nIn a Feb. 1 tweet, Cardin wrote that he was proud that the course is being piloted in Baltimore.\n\u201cAny kind of censoring or shielding students from #BlackHistory is a disservice to our nation & the people who came before us. Black History IS this nation\u2019s history,\u201d the senator said.\nAs of December, 31 students were enrolled in the AP course, according to Dennis Jutras, coordinator of Gifted and Advanced Learning at Baltimore City Public Schools. The district has not received any direct responses from students or families regarding the course, which \u201cis typically the case when things are going well,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe problem is that traditional history classes do not give equal bandwidth to all voices,\u201d added Jutras, who taught AP U.S. History for nine years. \u201cAP African American Studies \u2013 what it\u2019s doing is trying to balance the equation and giving a greater bandwidth to part of U.S. history that is oftentimes neglected.\u201d\nJutras said the legislation proposed by Cardin and Mfume would have minimal impact in Baltimore City schools.\n\u201cI definitely see a need for it in maybe some other districts in the state of Maryland,\u201d Jutras said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cAnd, of course, if national legislation would follow, there\u2019s certainly states that could use those kinds of protections, but in Baltimore City, we have a long history of genuinely appreciating academic freedom.\u201d\nAt a hearing earlier this month by the House Education and the Workforce Committee, Virginia Gentles, director of the Education Freedom Center at the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a conservative nonprofit, said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports the teaching of African American history in schools.\nHowever, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t think from a federal perspective that Congress needs to get involved in what a state should or shouldn\u2019t teach. That isn\u2019t the role of the federal government.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Florida, defended his state\u2019s choice to restrict the teaching of critical race theory.\n\u201cLet\u2019s teach subjects that matter, reading, writing, arithmetic. The so-called CRT, (critical race theory) we\u2019ve said \u2018no\u2019 in the state of Florida, \u2018no\u2019 to CRT. There\u2019s no value. There\u2019s no value to teach kids to hate each other based on race. There\u2019s no value in teaching kids to feel guilty just because they\u2019re of a certain race,\u201d Bean said.\nRep. Susan Wild, D-Pennsylvania, countered: \u201cCRT, otherwise known as critical race theory, is not taught in K-12 schools ever. This is a talking point that has been used by the opposition party to try to inflame parents and people and it is simply not done, and we need to stop talking about it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Del. Robin Grammer has proposed HB0137 to protect teachers from civil liability when disciplining students, aiming to address teacher concerns about potential lawsuits for intervening in student misconduct.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 School staff would receive protection from lawsuits stemming from discipling students under a proposed bill from Del. Robin Grammer, R-Baltimore, that is set to be heard in the General Assembly on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have significant problems with public education,\u201d Grammer told Capital News Service on Thursday. \u201cThe discipline issues are real, very real, despite the politicking around it.\u201d Teachers are afraid to intervene in bullying and other disciplinary problems for fear of lawsuits, and, he said, that\u2019s meant fewer teachers or teachers leaving the profession early.\nMelissa Dirks, president of the Frederick County Teachers Association, agrees.\n\u201cEven though educators still are showing up every day doing the best they can with the resources\u2014the very short resources\u2014that we are given, the same respect is not being shown in all segments of the community,\u201d she told Capital News Service on Friday.\u00a0\nThe proposed bill, HB0137, aims to protect teachers who intervene in fights or other cases of student misconduct from any civil liability they may face regarding property damage or personal injury, provided they acted in good faith and without negligence. A hearing on the bill is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 25, before the House Judiciary Committee; it will also be livestreamed on YouTube.\nCurrent law states that the county board of education is held financially responsible in the event that an educator is sued and damages are awarded against them. The Code of Maryland Regulations also ensures that as of now, the county board must provide legal counsel to school staff if the action was performed \u201cwithout malice\u201d and if they were \u201cacting within authorized official capacity.\u201d\nDirks noted that the proposed bill would not alter current law too drastically, but would lay out specifically what a school staff member would and would not be liable for, and in what situations.\n\u201cAny time we can bring clarity and make sure that educators are allowed to intercede to protect students without fear is a good thing,\u201d she said.\nThat was Grammer\u2019s goal in introducing the bill during this session, even though a nearly identical one failed in the 2020 session.\n\u201cYou look for simple ways that you could positively change policy to better the environment, regardless of what policy scope you\u2019re looking at,\u201d said Grammer. \u201cI thought this was a really positive bill. It\u2019s not revolutionary or groundbreaking, but it\u2019s something you could do. It\u2019s a little tweak that you can make to just tell teachers, if you\u2019re stepping in to prevent someone from getting hurt, we have your back.\u201d\nHe hopes the bill will give teachers more ability to control their classroom\u2019s environment in a way that best serves their students.\u00a0\n\u201cMaking sure our students are safe is always paramount, and we\u2019ve seen it time and time again where educators put their bodies on the line for their students,\u201d said Dirks. \u201cThat happens with or without this piece of legislation, but it is good for educators to know that they are supported by lawmakers and the law in this situation.\u201d\nThe act was first introduced during the 2020 Regular Session by former Delegate and Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Cox. In addition to Cox and Grammer, 32 other delegates, including six Democrats still in the House,\u00a0 sponsored the bill, then called HB802.\n\u201cYou know, Delegate Cox tended to be a controversial person, and I suspect towards the end there, that\u2019s probably why it failed,\u201d Grammar said. \u201cSo I figured we bring it back, \u2026 give it a shot and see if we can get it done.\u201d\nIn his testimony on the bill in 2020, Cox told lawmakers that teachers face challenges they didn\u2019t expect.\n\u201cA teacher should not need to worry about personal liability when intervening in a small scuffle or a schoolwide brawl,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cTeachers should not have to worry that they will be sued if they stop one student from inflicting harm on another.\u201d\nDirks, who also testified for the bill in 2020, agreed with Cox then on what the role of teachers should be.\u00a0\n\u201cEducators need to be able to focus our attention on the academic needs and physical safety of our students without fearing reprisal or risk of civil liability as a result of good faith actions aimed at protecting them,\u201d said Dirks in her 2020 written testimony.\nWhile it passed in the House on March 11, 2020, the bill died after being referred to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. Grammer said he hopes that with the freshman members of the House looking at it with new eyes, the bill will have enough support to become law.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s well written, it\u2019s very short. It\u2019s passed unanimously and had bipartisan support,\u201d Grammer said of the bill and its predecessor. \u201cI think one of the opportunities this year is really to walk through all this policy and have the freshman members hear a lot of it, and for them it\u2019s going to be brand new.\u201d\nGrammer said the current bill is the same as that passed by the House of Delegates during the 2020 legislative session.\u00a0 This includes an amendment suggested by the Maryland Association for Justice that further specifies the staff member must have intervened in a \u201creasonably prudent manner\u201d and the actions were not \u201cgrossly negligent, willful, wanton, or intentionally tortious.\u201d\n\u201cWe worked with this bill sponsor back in 2020 to improve the immunity provision to include a standard of conduct of reasonable prudence under the circumstances so that the bill was more clear in what conduct would be protected and what conduct would not be protected,\u201d said George Tolley, who was MAJ\u2019s legislative chair in 2020, of their proposed amendments.\u00a0\nThose who wish to testify on this bill will do so at the hearing on the 25. If passed, this act would go into effect Oct. 1.",

    "content": "McElderry Park, a struggling East Baltimore neighborhood, is trying to turn around the community with a program that pays students to polish their basketball skills while preparing them for college.\nClarence \u201cRay\u201d Askins, 17, is a senior at REACH! Partnership School and has participated in the YouthWorks summer program at the McElderry Park Community Association since his freshman year. Through this program, Askins is paid around $500 every other week for participating in a variety of college preparatory, leadership and basketball workshops. He also has to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5. The goal is to win entry into the college of his choice.\u00a0\n\u201cWe get paid to better ourselves and have fun,\u201d Askins said.\u00a0\nThe McElderry Park Community Association, backed by funding from foundations, is trying to reverse a dire trend in its community. One out of every two children in McElderry Park is living in poverty, almost double the citywide rate, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA). The high poverty leads to a decline in high school graduation rates and lower college attendance rates, according to the American Psychological Association. As of 2020, over 30% of students in McElderry Park did not complete high school, according to BNIA.\u00a0\nTo address this need, the McElderry Park Community Association began youth council programs in 2015 following Freddie Gray\u2019s death from injuries suffered in police custody, said Teddy Rosemond Jr., former McElderry Park resident and former vice president of the group. David Harris, the association\u2019s president, said in addition to the SAT and ACT test preparation, the program will take the youth on college tours. \u201cWe help them with their enrollment package \u2026 scholarship money, whatever they need,\u201d Harris, 52, said.\nThe student stipends are funded by YouthWorks, a Baltimore City organization, in partnership with the McElderry Park Community Association, said Rhonda McKinney, 51, program manager for the McElderry Park Community Association. Funding also comes from foundations, such as the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, and the Johns Hopkins Office of Government and Community Affairs, Harris said. Other funding comes from work performed by the McElderry Park association, such as picking up trash and debris from construction sites.\nRosemond, 22, grew up in McElderry Park, and is a co-founder of the McElderry Park Youth Council and a former vice president of the group. Rosemond is now a software engineer and said his time working with the youth council taught him a lot of interpersonal skills that have helped him in his career.\u00a0\n\u201cI was able to learn how to pitch myself, my purpose, my vision to apply for jobs,\u201d Rosemond said. \u201cI always wanted to help others and that\u2019s kind of what I tie into my work now.\u201d\nErnest Smith, 62, the McElderry Park Community Association treasurer, said the group wants to partner with nearby communities to expand these youth programs and \u201cdevelop a hub through which we can support one another.\u201d McElderry Park\u2019s youth programs have also partnered with some schools outside of the neighborhood, including Patterson High School and Forest Park High School.\nAskins said the paid stipend and SAT prep initially attracted him but he discovered the program had many more benefits. He recalled a guest speaker who described how he started from nothing and was able to turn his life around. \u201cHe\u2019s a great mentor to the youth,\u201d Askins said of the speaker. \u201cHe just [told] us how we can make it without being on the street.\u201d\nAskins said YouthWorks showed how he can be successful in Baltimore. He plans to attend college and return to give back to his hometown.\nAskins highly recommends the program. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we don\u2019t have a packed room every year,\u201d Askins said.",

Additionally, starting teacher salaries in Baltimore have risen only slightly since 2000, now ranking among the lowest in the state.",
    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 In Baltimore City, the Maryland community with the highest numbers of needy students and the most demand for experienced teachers, the salaries of teachers with a master\u2019s degree decreased from 2010 to 2020 to the lowest in the state, according to data from the Maryland State Department of Education.\nThe average salaries for Baltimore teachers with a master\u2019s degree declined from $72,758 in 2010, when it was among the middle of pay for such teachers in the state, to $64,405 in 2020, the data shows. The salary was more than $8,000 lower than what teachers with master\u2019s degrees were paid in Garrett County, the next lowest pay for a Maryland school district.\nIt is a far cry from the earnings of teachers with master\u2019s degrees in 2020 in Montgomery County, who made the highest salary in the state at $108,108, Baltimore County at $95,454, Prince George\u2019s County at $95,636 or Anne Arundel at $90,811, according to the state\u2019s data.\nFrom 2010 to 2020, every Maryland school district except Baltimore City experienced increases in salaries for teachers with a master\u2019s degree, according to state data. Montgomery County Public Schools teachers saw an 11.5% increase. Salaries for teachers with master\u2019s degrees increased by over 15% in Baltimore and Prince George\u2019s counties, by 10.7% in Anne Arundel County and by 3.8% in Frederick County.\nBaltimore City teachers with master\u2019s degrees experienced an 11.4% decrease.\n\nAdditionally, salaries for beginning Baltimore City teachers, those with bachelor\u2019s degrees and a standard professional certificate, have also fallen dramatically behind other Maryland school systems, according to the state data.\nIn 2000, a beginning teacher in Baltimore City earned $51,996, which was then the highest salary of any starting teacher in Maryland, the data shows.\u00a0Over the next 20 years, salaries for those teachers rose a mere $2,695 to $54,691 and ranked 20th among the state\u2019s 24 school systems.\nIn that same time frame, teacher salaries increased by over $17,000 in Baltimore County, by over $20,000 in Howard, Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties and by over $34,000 in Cecil County. Baltimore City was the only school system not to see an increase of at least $10,000 over that 20-year period, according to state data.\n\nCapital News Service reached out beginning in October to Sherry Christian, the Baltimore City school system\u2019s media relations manager, and other Baltimore City Public Schools officials for an explanation on how and why Baltimore teachers\u2019 salaries had fallen so dramatically behind other Maryland teachers. Neither Christian nor other officials responded to repeated requests.\nCristina Duncan Evans is the teachers chapter chair for the Baltimore Teachers Union. Duncan Evans said she had not heard of the dramatic decline in salaries for teachers with master\u2019s degrees or how far salaries for starting teachers had fallen behind in relation to other Maryland counties until contacted by Capital News Service.\nStill, she said, she was not surprised at the findings.\nDuncan Evans explained that school systems in Maryland recruit beginning teachers largely from outside their counties, so they need to offer attractive salaries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive market,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t keep up with the other school systems, you are going to fall behind. It\u2019s a sign that our district has not put much effort in competing with other counties.\u00a0We\u2019ve been fighting with the district to increase salaries for beginning teachers,\u00a0but they haven\u2019t made that a priority.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a position that impacts our students.\u201d\nThe highest rate of turnover among Baltimore City teachers is among beginning instructors, she said.\u00a0 More than one of every three Baltimore City school teachers have been in the classroom five years or less, according to the Fund for Educational Excellence 2021-2022 survey.\nThe salaries for Baltimore City teachers with master\u2019s degrees began to decline the same year the city\u2019s public school system began using a new way to determine teacher\u2019s salaries called the Career Pathways System, state data shows.\nThe system, which was agreed upon by Baltimore City Public Schools and the Baltimore Teachers Union, is a departure from a traditional pay system that rewards teachers for experience and educational attainment.\nDuncan Evans said she also wasn\u2019t surprised that salaries for master\u2019s teachers had declined.\u00a0 They decreased, she explained, because Baltimore City teachers\u2019 \u201ccontract doesn\u2019t compensate for a master\u2019s degree,\u201d as do the reward systems in other Maryland counties.\n\u201cWe have a system that rewards professional development and relies on a peer reviewed portfolio and teacher evaluations to advance,\u201d she said. \u201cTeacher evaluations are the single biggest way that people move in our system.\u201d\nAccording to the city school\u2019s website, the structure allows teachers in Baltimore City to \u201ctake control of their careers and grow within a system of career pathways and salary intervals.\u201d Movement from one pathway to the next is determined by \u201cpeer reviews that weigh instruction, leadership, continual learning and student growth,\u201d the website said.\nFor years, teachers in\u00a0 Maryland and other states pursued master\u2019s degrees in part because the additional education\u00a0 was rewarded by school systems through a significant increase in pay.\nDuncan Evans said the teachers\u2019 union and the school system decided in 2010\u00a0 to stop rewarding teachers solely for achieving a master\u2019s degree because some studies showed it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean teachers become better at their jobs.\nMost other Maryland school systems continue to reward teachers financially after they earn a master\u2019s degree.\n\u201cJust because they do it, doesn\u2019t mean they are right,\u201d Duncan Evans said.\nBut she also agreed that the decision by the Baltimore City school system doesn\u2019t mean the other Maryland school systems are wrong.\nThe Maryland State Board of Education requires all public school teachers to complete a master\u2019s degree after 10 years of teaching.\nDespite the differences in pay for Baltimore City teachers and those other counties, a survey of Baltimore teachers conducted at the end of the 2021-22 school year found Baltimore teachers are largely satisfied with their pay.\n\u201cThe salary they can earn under the Career Pathways for Teachers model and the benefits package are major factors in overall teacher satisfaction,\u201d teachers told surveyors for the Fund for Educational Excellence. \u201cSeveral teachers say that they would not be able to find a teaching job that pays as well in any of the neighboring school districts; a move would mean having to leave the classroom for an administrative position.\u201d\nDuncan Evans, however, said the study also showed opinions more evenly split on salaries.\n\u201cTeachers said compensation was just as much an issue for leaving (the school system) as it was a reason for staying,\u201d she said.\nThe challenges of teaching in Baltimore City schools and the needs of the system\u2019s children have been well documented. For example, of Maryland public schools ranked by percentage of students who qualify for free lunch, 40 of the top 75 were in Baltimore City, according to Public School Review, a service that provides information on public schools using data from federal and state education agencies.\nTonya Shelby is graduate program professor and advisor at Towson University\u2019s College of Education where she teaches undergraduate students and current teachers who are working toward a masters\u2019 degree.\n\u201cI tell my students that teachers with that master\u2019s level knowledge can bring so much perspective to a struggling school,\u201d she said.\nTeachers with master\u2019s degrees make better teachers and they also can help other teachers work through problems with their classes, Shelby said.\nDwayne, a Baltimore City school teacher who asked to use his middle name, because of privacy concerns, said the many issues Baltimore students grapple with unrelated to education are why it is important to have teachers with master\u2019s degrees.\n\u201cFor some of these kids, school is the last thing on their minds,\u201d Dwayne said. \u201cSome of them have a toxic home life and others can\u2019t even tell you the next time they\u2019re going to eat an actual meal.\u201d\nDwayne, who has his master\u2019s degree and has been a teacher for over a decade, said the extra challenges that come with teaching kids in Baltimore may be too much to handle for younger, inexperienced teachers. He said reasons like that are why teachers with master\u2019s degrees should be of high value to any school system.\n\u201cFor someone without that extra education or preparation, it can get very easy to just give up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you need the veterans around just to keep morale up on staff. You gotta keep those people around.\u201d\nDr. Thurman Bridges, a professor in the School of Education and Urban Studies at Morgan State University, agrees.\n\u201cIn Baltimore City and other struggling districts, there is a huge benefit to having (master\u2019s degree) teachers that have been there a while,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey have valuable relationships with the students, parents and have built that trust within the community.\u201d\nCapital News Service reporters Lyna Bentahar, Mythili Devarakonda and Abigail Zimmardi contributed to this story.\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled Cristina Duncan Evans.",

    "summary": "Bishop Walsh School in Cumberland, Maryland, faced closure due to declining enrollment but revived its future by establishing an elite boys\u2019 basketball team. This strategic move stabilized enrollment and transformed the school\u2019s reputation, making it a competitive force in national basketball.",
    "content": "One of the smallest Catholic schools in Maryland was fighting to keep its doors open.\nAt Bishop Walsh School in Cumberland, enrollment had fallen sharply over several years. And despite the support of a passionate and close-knit community, the future of the K-12 school looked bleak.\n\u201cThe school was going to close. We were in the last year of the school,\u201d said Joseph Carter, president of Bishop Walsh.\nBishop Walsh needed a rescue plan. The one that officials landed on was unexpected for a school that rarely distinguished itself in sports: It built an elite boys\u2019 basketball team.\nFour years later, there is no talk of closing Bishop Walsh.\nEnrollment has stabilized at approximately 330 students, principal Jennifer Flinn said. The high school level in particular has seen an increase in enrollment, boosted by the basketball players who have transferred to the school, according to Flinn.\nAnd the school has a basketball team to be proud of. It\u2019s the best in school history. And it aspires to be one of the best in the country.\n\nBuilding an elite basketball program\nThe school campus is located at the end of Bishop Walsh Road on a ridge overlooking downtown Cumberland, a once prosperous coal-mining and transportation hub.\nThe glory days of the \u201cQueen City\u2019 came in the first half of the 20th century. When Franklin Roosevelt was president, Cumberland\u2019s population was nearly 40,000. Today, it numbers less than 20,000.\nBishop Walsh opened in 1966, when five small high schools in the area merged. For many years, the school grew. A middle school was added in 1985, then an elementary school followed about twenty years ago. In recent years, though, enrollment had slipped, and concerns about the future grew urgent.\nWhile some Bishop Walsh officials said the decline had not reached a crisis, Carter recalled pressing concern: \u201cWe had to do something to get students in the building.\u201d\n(Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nSo the school brought in Dan Prete. A well-known high school coach. Prete had experienced big-time sports as associate head varsity coach at Montrose Christian School in Rockville. During his time at Montrose Christian, from 2001-2013, Prete and other coaches sent 36 players to NCAA Division I schools, including NBA star Kevin Durant.\n\n\u201cWe had to do something to get students in the building.\u201d\n\u2014Joseph Carter, Bishop Walsh president\n\nWhen Prete arrived at Bishop Walsh in 2018, few at the school could imagine a basketball team that would play against future pro basketball stars and recruit players from all over the world. But that was Prete\u2019s vision.\n\u201cThe school fell on some tough times, like a lot of schools in this area did [because] of the economy,\u201d Prete said. \u201cBut there\u2019s passionate people here that always wanted something more.\u201d\nPrete brought an international flair to recruiting. He has traveled internationally to coach basketball camps twice, to Morocco in 2013 and to Brazil in 2019, and he maintains an international network of coaching contacts.\nBishop Walsh guard Vilius Slanina hails from Lithuania, and he ended up at the school through one of Prete\u2019s connections.\n\u201cI moved to the United States in August [2021], two weeks before the start of school,\u201d Slanina said.\nThe 2021-22 roster featured several other international players, including Maor Nekrashevich from Israel and Myles Hosten from the United Kingdom. The international students live in a dormitory with the rest of their teammates and several other Bishop Walsh students.\nThe international players were drawn to Bishop Walsh because of Prete, but also because of where Prete brought Bishop Walsh: To the National Interscholastic Basketball Conference.\n(Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nCompeting against the best of the best\nLed by Prete, the Spartans joined the NIBC, a new scholastic super conference.\nBefore joining the NIBC, the Spartans\u2019 boys basketball team was good and sometimes very good in a schedule filled with local competition. Players grew up in the area. Few went on to play college basketball in Division I schools of the NCAA. The squad rarely was recognized beyond its hometown.\nIn their new conference, the Spartans play in arguably the most competitive league of private high schools in the country. Their opponents include powerhouses such as IMG Academy and Montverde Academy in Florida and Oak Hill Academy in Virginia. All NIBC games are shown on ESPN networks.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cHigh Stakes Hoops\u201d ]\nThe NIBC formed in May 2021, a collaboration of ESPN and Paragon Sports Marketing, whose president, Rashid Ghazi, is a pioneer in putting high school games on TV.\nThe first five teams to join the NIBC were Montverde, Oak Hill, La Lumiere School, Sunrise Christian Academy and Legacy School \u2014 all teams with histories of success on the court. Montverde has featured top draft picks including NBA stars Ben Simmons, R.J. Barrett, D\u2019Angelo Russell and Cade Cunningham.\nThat pipeline of court talent has continued since the launch of the NIBC. In 2021, there were nine McDonald\u2019s All-Americans across the eight teams that joined the conference.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the best of the best night in and night out,\u201d Bishop Walsh assistant basketball coach Lafayette Dublin said. \u201cThere are no nights off.\u201d\nWhile Bishop Walsh\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not match some of the other schools in the conference, Prete\u2019s coaching reputation and relationships with league officials were the points that got the Spartans invited to the party.\nThe move to the NIBC attracted more eyes to Bishop Walsh\u2019s basketball program and to the school. For the first time, alums from Cumberland and across the country were watching their team on their smartphones and TVs.\nOut of the 38 NIBC games in the inaugural 2021-22 season, seven were nationally televised on ESPNU while the remaining 31 were streamed on ESPN+. Eight of Bishop Walsh\u2019s games were streamed on ESPN+ while the Spartans\u2019 game against Sunrise Christian was on ESPNU.\nIn the first NIBC season, the level of competition clearly challenged Bishop Walsh. The Spartans finished 1-9 against NIBC teams. Their only win came against Wasatch Academy.\nStill, the slow start was not unexpected by NIBC officials.\n\u201cWe\u2026 recognize that every team\u2019s not going to be Montverde, IMG or Sunrise,\u201d Ghazi said. \u201cThere will be teams that are in the middle, teams at the bottom and teams at the top, and sometimes those middle or bottom teams may have a great year.\n\u201cI think Bishop Walsh is in a great position to continue in the league for a long time. We just have to see how they do over the next two or three years,\u201d he said.\nMaking their mark\nThe season ended on a high note at the Alhambra Catholic Invitational Tournament (ACIT), a local basketball tournament started in 1961. In more than 50 years playing in the ACIT, Bishop Walsh never had won more than one game out of the three played by each team in the tournament in a single year.\nThe Spartans rewrote history.\nWhile they lost their first game to national powerhouse DeMatha, they beat Bishop McNamara at the buzzer in the first round of the consolation bracket. Cumberland native Mikey Allen hit a 3-pointer as time expired to seal the win.\nIn the championship of the consolation bracket, Bishop Walsh again won at the buzzer, again on a 3-pointer by Allen.\n\n\u23f0 GAME WINNING 3 AT THE BUZZER FOR MIKEY ALLEN!!! \u23f0\nFor the second day in a row, @mikeyallen18 is @BWSpartansHoops hero with a DEEP 3 \ud83c\udfaf as time expires.

Experts support universal pre-K programs, noting they benefit all children while particularly helping disadvantaged ones, and also aid parents by providing affordable childcare options.",
    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Gov-elect Wes Moore, D, has a laundry list of plans for Maryland.\nMoore wants to give students an option to complete a year of paid service after high school, raise the minimum wage to $15 this year instead of the scheduled increase in 2025 and support small businesses through modernizing the regulation process. \nOne of his focuses, which he discussed repeatedly during his campaign, is to provide free pre-kindergarten for all of the state\u2019s three- and four- year olds in need. \nThe state\u2019s Blueprint Plan promises to expand free pre-K to all children in need in the next 10 years. Passed in 2021 and beginning in 2023, the plan promises to increase education funding by $3.8 billion each year for the next 10 years. \nMoore says it needs to happen sooner.\n\u201cOur children cannot wait 10-plus years for the plan\u2019s full implementation,\u201d Moore said in his \u2018Cradle to Career\u2019 education plan on his website.  \nMany states, including Maryland, have already launched programs or are in the process of doing so. \nExperts and academicians say there are numerous benefits to expanding pre-K access.\n\u201cUniversal programs are the only ones that ensure all children, especially the most disadvantaged, actually access quality programs,\u201d said Steven Barnett, senior co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research, an organization considered the lead expert on early childhood education. \n\u201cMany children not in poverty gain from pre-K as well, even if they gain less than those who are more disadvantaged.\u201d\nDoug Lent is communications director for the Maryland Family Network, a non-profit that advocates for quality childcare for children from birth to age five.\nLent said expanded pre-K would provide families with two benefits while also reducing societal poverty.\n\u201cIt would give parents access to childcare who could not normally afford that childcare, which means parents can go to work while kids are\u2026also receiving the skills that they need to then later on go into the workforce or into education,\u201d he said.\nIn Baltimore City, free pre-K builds on the teaching relationship between parents and their children, said Crystal Francis, director of Early Learning for Baltimore City schools.\n\u201cOur parents are a child\u2019s first teacher,\u201d Francis said. \u201cSo we always want to make sure that we are just kind of opening up and sharing experiences that our kids are having, and supporting families with what they can do at home. You know, we don\u2019t want families to feel like they are not a part of the learning that happens here.\u201d \nExperts say pre-K is important because by age five, 90% of the brain is developed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hyperbole to say that it is one of the most important decisions that a parent will ever make for their child,\u201d Lent said. \u201cThe first five years of a child\u2019s life quite literally set the stage for everything that comes after.\u201d \nBerol Dewdney teaches pre-K at Commodore John Rogers Elementary and Middle School in Baltimore. Dewdney is also the 2022-2023 Maryland teacher of the year.\nOn a sunny, but cold Tuesday morning, Dewdney\u2019s students start their day reciting affirmations, some greet her with a hug and all commit to help keep the classroom safe before learning begins. A fall-themed countdown timer plays in the background and helps students learn time management as they play with blocks and toys while their teacher finishes setting up for the day. \nDewdney said she focuses her classroom on brain-based learning \u2013 learning that teaches children to plan, focus attention, juggle multiple tasks and to memorize.\nStudents in the classroom can be seen moving between small groups, creating play plans and putting those plans into motion by using toys set up in the classroom. \nBefore the day begins, Dewdney talks with a student, part of a process in which the class can be found playing with blocks and speaking with peers.(Shannon Clark/Capital News Service)\n\u201cPlay is often thought of as this sort of cute thing, but it\u2019s not just cute,\u201d Dewdney said. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s the language of kids, and they are the experts. So, we believe in using a play-based curriculum.\u201d \nDewdney said she has seen the benefit of having accessible pre-K transcend beyond the classroom.\n\u201cStudents love learning,\u201d she said. \u201cThey love coming to school, but they feel empowered to take that learning wherever they go.\u201d\nBut the primary question regarding expanded pre-K for Moore and state legislators will be the issue of cost and how to pay for it.\nLent said there is no simple answer to estimating the cost of implementing universal pre-K, due to different factors on how to pay for it.\nAs of last September, 27,767 students were enrolled in free pre-K in Maryland. In 2021, Maryland spent over $7,414 on each child enrolled, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research.\nGeorgia became the first state to launch universal free pre-K. It started as a pilot program in 1992. It provides free voluntary pre-K to all of the state\u2019s four-year-olds. \nAround 72,000 children are currently enrolled, according to Susan Adams, deputy commissioner for pre-K and Institutional Support for the Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning.  \nDuring a typical day, Georgia pre-kindergarteners can be found participating in small group activities, playing with other children outside or learning in a classroom setting, Adams said.\nThe program has multiple benefits, she said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get families that are going to benefit from it because we have an enriching environment for children to participate in while they go to work or school,\u201d she said. \nEvery state but Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire and South Dakota have some form of free pre-K, either in development or operation, according to a NIEER 2021 research study. Wyoming and Indiana were also listed, but Indiana now offers grants to low-income families to pay for pre-K and a rural preschool in Wyoming in April 2022 received a community foundation grant for free classes. \nSome states like Georgia, rely on the state\u2019s lottery to fund their pre-K programs. Georgia\u2019s program received $400 million for the 2022-2023 school year from the state\u2019s lottery, Adams said, an amount equivalent to the pre-K budget.\nAlabama\u2019s First Class Pre-K program is funded through the state\u2019s education budget, which this year allocated around $174 million towards the program, said Barbara J. Cooper, secretary of the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education. \nMoore has said he will pay for Maryland\u2019s expanded pre-K program through taxes on revenue from \u201ccannabis, sports betting and record income tax revenue.\u201d Additionally, he said, he would use money in \u201ccapital from the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure bill,\u201d two federal programs Congress passed last year to help states with a variety of projects.\nImplementing free pre-K comes with a suggested list of national standards by NIEER that school systems have adopted as a trademark of a high quality program. Cooper in Alabama proudly proclaims that her state\u2019s program has met the standards for the last 16 years.  \nThe institute\u2019s guidelines include requiring all pre-K teachers to have a bachelor\u2019s degree, classes be capped at 20 students and schools have a \u201ccomprehensive, aligned, supported and culturally sensitive curriculum.\u201d \nThe National Institute for Early Education Research\u2019s ten standards for high quality pre-Kindergarten. (Courtesy of the National Institute for Early Education Research)\nBowie, Maryland, has a free pre-K program that it launched in 2020 after receiving a $400,000 grant from the state education department. The program, which continues to be state-funded, started at Reid Temple Christian Academy for children in Prince George\u2019s County, which already had a private pre-K program. \nBrenda Bethea, interim head of school, said Reid Temple applied to host the program at the request of the city\u2019s mayor, Tim Adams.  \n\u201c(The city was) very interested in seeing the same results that all of our children here at the academy show at any given time,\u201d Bethea said. \nThe academy\u2019s private and free programs represent the challenge for Moore and state educators as they expand the state\u2019s existing program.\nBethea said she feels the state-financed program\u2019s curriculum is inferior to that of the school\u2019s tuition-based program. \nThe tuition-based program uses Wonders curriculum, along with additional resources to \u201cmove children forward\u201d developmentally, Bethea said.  \nThe free program has many of the NIEER requirements, all teachers must be state-certified, the program must use state prescribed curriculum and 20 spots are allotted per classroom.\nIts teachers use Connect4Learning, a curriculum that Bethea calls a \u201cwatered down early childhood program.\u201d  \n\u201cIt is mediocre,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is much needed, but it is a mediocre product that has been offered to children.\u201d \nBack in Baltimore, Dewdney advises state officials to be mindful as they implement the expanded program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very pivotal moment in Maryland, but also in our country,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy around pre-K, but there is a difference between honoring and knowing that early childhood and high quality early childhood education matters and making that happen.\u201d",

The rise is attributed to advocacy groups targeting multiple books at once, often due to content related to LGBTQ individuals or people of color.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The number of books people tried to ban from schools and libraries nearly tripled between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the American Library Association.\u00a0\nThe ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom tracked 729 challenges to 1,597 separate book titles in 2021. That\u2019s up from 377 challenges to 566 book titles in 2019.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that I\u2019ve never witnessed in the two decades I\u2019ve worked for the Office for Intellectual Freedom and a real change in the nature of the demands to censor books,\u201d said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the organization.\nIn 2021, the ten most commonly banned books according to the ALA were Gender Queer, Lawn Boy, All Boys Aren\u2019t Blue, Out of Darkness, The Hate U Give, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Bluest Eye, This Book is Gay and Beyond Magenta.\nBook banning is not a new idea. In fact, Banned Books Week\u2014which promotes book titles targeted over the decades\u2014has been celebrated in libraries since 1982.\u00a0\n \nMost Banned Books By Year by Jonathan Hunter Donville\nBut the scope of efforts to ban books is new. Caldwell-Stone attributes the rise in book banning to advocacy groups calling for the removal of dozens of books at the same time.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to clarify that it\u2019s entirely appropriate for a parent to raise a concern about a book their student is reading and have discussions about that with librarians or teachers and even making a choice that the book isn\u2019t the right book for their child or their student,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing now is advocacy groups going to school boards and library boards with a list of 10, 25 or even 50 books, demanding their removal all at once, often based on claims that the books are either inappropriate because they reference LGBTQ persons, or reflect the lives and experiences of Black persons or persons of color.\u201d\nGroups like Moms for Liberty and No Left Turn in Education have been vigorous advocates for book removal. The groups have ties to conservative groups and donors.\u00a0\n\u201cUnfortunately, what we have found is that there is obscene graphic sexual content in books that are located in public school libraries across the United States of America,\u201d said Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAmerican parents are very concerned about the fact that their children have access to pornography in school, that it\u2019s being done under the supervision of adults who are okay with children having access to pornography in schools, and so we have gotten involved to ensure that school districts follow the law because apparently they are unable to do that on their own,\u201d she said.\nJustice declined to enumerate books Moms for Liberty disapproves of.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for a national organization to put out a list because we don\u2019t want parents to think that every book is in every single library,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to go and do the work to find what books are in their libraries, and what books and what the laws and statutes are in their state.\u201d\u00a0\nPEN America, a nonprofit that says it works to celebrate and defend free expression, identified at least 50 organizations pushing for book removals across the country.\u00a0\n[Book banning resonates as an issue in Maryland school board races]\n\u201cPreviously, you might have somebody objecting to a particular book because of a particular slur or offensive statement, or representation or content with something people don\u2019t like, but now we have this mass list of books or people going to databases and looking up with any book that has any LGBTQ content, or any book that touches on the history or contemporary commentary about racism,\u201d said Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education programs at PEN America. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an escalation of book banning, culminating in something that is really different from the banning we saw even five years ago.\u201d\nThe book challenges have been effective: According to data from Northeastern University, 15 states have passed legislation banning certain books in K-12 education, often on the grounds that they contain elements of critical race theory. An additional 16 states have proposed similar legislation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the distressing thing about this time,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing elected officials adopt the rhetoric that books dealing with race, racism and slavery are inappropriate for young people to read, or if they are available, can only reflect certain viewpoints\u2014a certain view of history that the elected officials and the advocacy groups approve of. And we\u2019re seeing elected officials also adopt the rhetoric that books dealing with gay, queer or transgender people are inappropriate for young people to read and demanding that such books be removed from schools and libraries.\u201d\u00a0\nPEN America found that about half of challenged books are intended for young adult readers, but they also include picture books intended for elementary schoolers.\u00a0\nBooks like Heather Has Two Mommies, This Day in June \u2014 a picture book about Pride parades \u2014 and Anti-Racist Baby have all been challenged or banned. The organization also found that 41% of banned books \u201cexplicitly address LGBTQ+ themes or have protagonists or prominent secondary characters who are LGBTQ+.\u201d\u00a0\nJustice says that the idea that the book challenge fight is about LGBTQ issues is a lie.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear about saying that parents being concerned about pornography in schools whether it\u2019s with heterosexual couples, homosexual couples, heterosexual children, homosexual children, their sexual orientation isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pornography. That\u2019s the issue and we need to be honest about that.\u201d\nCaldwell-Stone worries about this trend from both a legal and moral standpoint.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about public institutions, government-funded institutions, engaged in telling young people and telling families and telling adults what they can read and think about, which is repugnant to the First Amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a matter of addressing the dignity and humanity of others who live in society and their right to find their lives and experiences. reflected in the collections of a public library or school library that their taxes support as well.\u201d\u00a0\nFriedman agreed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s having an impact for students, teachers, writers, publishers and librarians, some of whom have been harassed or intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s highly concerning because if you start reducing the availability of books based on anything anyone might object to, you\u2019re very quickly going to run out of any kind of library or classroom book to have available to young people.\u201d\nCaldwell-Stone said she anticipates the number of challenged books this year will be about the same or higher than last year.\n\u201cThe end result is that books that do reflect the diversity of society, that reflect the lives of persons who attend that school or part of the community and that the public library serves, are being told that they don\u2019t belong and that their stories don\u2019t belong,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that is the ultimate tragedy here.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's NAEP test results show a decline in student performance across grades and subjects since 2019, with Baltimore City experiencing significant drops, particularly in fourth-grade math; however, eighth-grade reading scores remained stable in Baltimore City and showed no decline compared to other urban districts. The gap between white and Hispanic students' scores has widened over the past two decades, reflecting increased disparities in educational outcomes.",
    "content": "Maryland school test scores reflected a national decline in learning, according to newly released data from national tests known as the \u201cnation\u2019s report card.\u201d\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests are administered yearly to students across the country. The latest test was the first given since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fourth-grade and eighth-grade students across the country took the reading and math exams.\nMaryland\u2019s results give insight into the extent of learning loss in the state during the pandemic.\n\u00a0\nBaltimore City saw decreases in every test, except in eighth-grade reading\nBaltimore City participates in the NAEP\u2019s Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA), which is designed to measure educational outcomes in urban school districts, according to the organization\u2019s website.\u00a0\nThe school district experienced a 15-point decrease in average fourth-grade math scores from 2019 (218 to 203), tied with Cleveland for the largest decline among the 26 districts participating in the TUDA. The score to reach the NAEP Basic level\u2014 the lowest of the NAEP test\u2014 is 214.\nEighth-grade reading test scores were the only exception, holding at 241. Baltimore City was one of the few jurisdictions in the TUDA that didn\u2019t experience a decline in eighth-grade reading scores, along with Clark County in Nevada and Miami-Dade and Duval counties in Florida.\n\n\u00a0\nThe gap between scores for white and Hispanic students has grown in the past couple of years\nThe average score for Maryland fourth-grade Hispanic students in reading was 40 points lower than that for white students in 2022. In 1998, this performance gap was 18 points. The average score for Maryland Hispanic eighth-graders in reading was 30 points lower than their white counterparts in 2022, compared to 11 points in 1998.\nThis trend also persisted in math scores.\nThis year Hispanic fourth-graders in Maryland had an average math score 37 points lower than white students, compared to 20 points in 2000. Hispanic eighth-graders scored 39 points lower than white students in math, compared to 23 points in 2000.\n\n\u00a0\nRural students outperformed other students based on location\nThe NAEP assigns districts into one of four location types: city, suburban, rural, and town. On average, rural students outperformed students in the other location types.\u00a0\nFor fourth-graders, the average math score for rural students was higher than the lowest average city students by 20 points. In reading, rural students scored higher than city students by 22 points on average. Rural students were also the other location category that saw an increase in reading scores for this demographic.\nRural eighth-graders in the state scored higher on the reading exams than the lowest performing group, suburban students, by 11 points. City and suburban eighth-graders both had the same average math score this year. Rural students scored better than both groups by 14 points.\n\n\u00a0\nMaryland scored in the middle of the pack nationally\nIn 2022, the average score in Maryland (259) was lower than those in 7 jurisdictions, higher than those in 9 jurisdictions and not significantly different from those in 35 jurisdictions.\nThe state performed the best compared to other states in eighth-grade reading and lagged behind in fourth-grade math. The average fourth-grade math score of 229 was lower than 35 other jurisdictions.",

That $106,676.10 lien from 2016 was satisfied last year.\u00a0\nAt least 12 of Maryland\u2019s 155 school board candidates have had state or federal liens filed against them in the past two decades for not paying their taxes on time.\nCapital News Service reporters scoured the state court records of every school board candidate in the state, and tax liens were the most common court record found.\nCNS is reporting on the candidates\u2019 tax liens because they reflect the financial habits of individuals who could soon play a major role in deciding how school districts spend their money.\nBut April Christina Curley, one of the four candidates running for the school board in Baltimore City, said the lien that she needs to settle stems from the fact that she\u2019s poor.\n\u201cIt is public information,\u201d Curley said of the lien. \u201cBut at the same time, I think it\u2019s a good reflection of how this system was created to keep regular people out.\u201d\nA lien is a legal claim filed in court against the assets of someone who has not paid a debt.\u00a0\nREAD MORE:\nCourt records tie Charles County school board candidate to multiple arrests\n\n\u201cBy filing a lien, the Comptroller\u2019s Office essentially marks their place in line as a creditor\u201d to extract payment from someone who owes at least several thousand dollars in back taxes, said Nicholas Berger, a senior director at Frost Law, a Maryland-based firm specializing in tax law.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe individual or business with the unpaid tax balances and tax lien can then set up a payment plan or negotiate a settlement to resolve the unpaid debt,\u201d said Berger, who used to work at the state Comptroller\u2019s Office. \u201cIf the assessment remains unpaid and ignored, the Comptroller\u2019s Office can take more drastic action such as levies, garnishments or holds on professional licenses and driver\u2019s licenses.\u201d\nCourt records indicate, though, that that didn\u2019t happen with the Maryland school board candidates who had liens filed against them. In most cases, the candidates eventually paid their taxes.\nBelow, the candidates with past liens have been listed under the county in which they are running. The counties are arranged by the number of candidates with liens, the counties with more at the top.\nCharles County:\nCalvin Montgomery Sr., a candidate for the District 1 seat, has had several federal and state tax liens filed against him. In April 2011, a federal lien was filed against him in the amount of $44,691.54. Another federal tax lien was filed against him in April the year after in the amount of $11,245.85. There was no evidence in the court records about how or whether those liens were satisfied.\nMontgomery had both a state and federal tax lien filed against him in June 2015. On June 24, 2015, a state lien was filed in the amount of $3,328.54, and it has been satisfied. On June 30, 2015, a federal lien was filed for $12,296.57, and it was settled in July 2022.\nMontgomery did not reply to requests for comment on these liens.\nYonelle Moore Lee, who is running for the District 4 seat, has had three liens filed against her, each in a different Maryland county.\u00a0\nThe first was filed in the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court in December 2004 in the amount of $8,353.02. The second, which was filed in the Montgomery County Circuit Court in January 2005, was in the amount of $23,225.68. The two previously stated liens were settled in 2013. The final and most recent lien, in the amount of $1,079.41, was a state tax lien filed in April 2014 in Charles County Circuit Court and satisfied in February 2015. Lee did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\nJulie Brown, who is running for the District 2 seat, shares an address in Indian Head and a birthday with a Julie Lee Melton, who had $13,774.19 in state tax liens filed against her at that address on Jan. 25, 2022. Brown denied going by the name Julie Lee Melton and said: \u201cI don\u2019t have tax liens,\u201d but said Melton is her daughter\u2019s maiden name.\nThe liens were divided into four subsets: $2,402.87, $5,008.73, $4,879.62 and $1,482.97. The case was closed, but it is unclear whether Melton has paid.\nMontgomery County:\nGrace Rivera-Oven, a District 1 candidate, and her husband Mark J. Oven had a federal lien of $106,767 filed against them on April 22, 2016. That lien was satisfied on June 2, 2021.\nThis lien is listed in the names of Mark J. Oven and G.C. Rivera-Oven. The candidate used the name Grace Rivera Oven in her campaign filing with the Board of Elections, but the candidate confirmed on her campaign website that she is married to Mark J. Oven.\nCNS emailed the candidate for comment, but has not yet received a response.\nEsther L. Wells, running for the county\u2019s District 1 seat, had a lien filed against her in Montgomery Circuit Court in January 2020 in the amount of $8,708.66. After the lien was filed, Wells said she submitted proper documentation that took several months to process due to pandemic-related slowdowns at the Maryland Comptroller\u2019s Office. The lien was then satisfied in April 2021.\nKent County:\nTracy Cameransi has had three liens filed against her. In January 2008, there was a judgment lien filed against her in the amount of $73,468.96, which was then satisfied in September 2013. There was a second judgment lien filed against her for $10,596.79 that was released in June 2015. A third lien, recorded in December 2011, was in the amount of $14,171.19.\n\u201cAny lien that we had was due to an unfortunate situation many years ago,\u201d Cameransi stated in an email. She said she worked with a public accountant, and all of the liens have been satisfied.\nAretha Dorsey has had two liens filed against her and Samuel Dorsey. The first was recorded in February 2009 in the amount of $3,268.74, and it was satisfied in March 2011. The second, filed in March 2011 in the amount of $3,740.11, was settled in February 2013. Dorsey did not answer requests for comment.\nBaltimore City:\nSalimah Jasani had one state tax lien filed against her in November 2019 for $1,302.95 that was settled shortly after in January 2020.\u00a0\nJasani said she served as a member of Americorps, an independent agency of the federal government focused on community service work. As a member, she received an education award, or scholarship, about seven years ago that was sent to the Johns Hopkins University, where she was completing a master\u2019s degree in education studies.\nBecause the award was sent directly to the university, Jasani only saw a decrease in the amount that she owed the university. However, she later heard from the IRS that she was supposed to report that funding as income when she filed her taxes.\u00a0\nAfter communication with the IRS, Jasani said that they told her she owed more taxes because of this income, so she paid it off. After the issue was resolved, Jasani received a lien notice from the state of Maryland, which was the first communication from the state on this matter. She said she settled the lien as soon as she received it.\u00a0\nApril Christina Curley said her state tax lien of $16,418.60 reflects many Baltimore families\u2019 struggles with indebtedness and poverty.\n\u201cThe reality is I\u2019m poor,\u201d she said. \u201cI am absolutely poor.\u201d\nCurley said she works two jobs and financially supports her sister, five nephews, niece and mother.\nWhile Curley said she isn\u2019t sure what she owes taxes for, she thinks the lien has to do with living in multiple states in 2018. That year, Curley transferred from Google\u2019s office in New York City to Washington, D.C., and said she was taxed in Maryland, the District and New York. She plans to address the tax lien after the election.\nAllegany County:\nLori Lepley had a state tax lien filed against her in August 2022 in the amount of $8,159.02.\nLepley said she had included a Historic District Tax Credit in her filings after her accountant had recommended it because she owns a building in Cumberland\u2019s historic downtown district, but it was denied by the state. After many attempts to reach out and appeal the decision with no success, Lepley was instead notified of a tax lien. She said she has since entered a payment arrangement to satisfy the lien.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was disappointing that the state was denying tax credits for such an important part of our historic downtown because building owners like me invest that money in continuing to improve our downtown,\u201d Lepley stated in an email response. \u201cHowever, I will abide by their decision. I am glad it is resolved, even if I did not get a satisfactory answer to my own questions.\u201d\nFrederick County:\nCindy Rose had a tax lien of $2,685.73 filed against her and Jamie Rose in April 2003 that was settled in 2005.\n\u201cThat was a long time ago. To the best of my recollection we owed some sort of tax in 2003 but couldn\u2019t afford to pay it off until 2005,\u201d Rose said in an email statement.\nWashington County:\nMichael Guessford is an incumbent of the school board. He has had both state and federal liens filed against him. A state lien, recorded in August 2001 for $4,881.96, was settled in January 2002. There was also a series of federal liens filed against him in June 2012 totaling $69,782.17. They were satisfied in July 2014. Guessford did not respond to requests for comment on these liens.\u00a0\nCNS reporter Khushboo Rathore contributed to this report.",

    "content": "Resting on the shelves of some public schools nationwide are two memoirs from LGBTQ+ authors detailing the growing pains they lived through while growing up and finding themselves.\nThose books \u2013 \u201cGender Queer\u201d and \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d \u2013 and others like them have become flash points in school board races nationwide, including in Maryland. Conservative candidates argue that drawings and passages in such books qualify as pornography.\n\u201cAny book with pornographic material should not be on school library shelves,\u201d Frederick County school board candidate Olivia Angolia said in response to a Capital News Service survey of the state\u2019s school board candidates.\u00a0 \u201cThere needs to be a vigorous process to review library books that are already adopted, and any prospective books.\u201d\nBut Rae Gallagher, one of Angolia\u2019s opponents, offers a different take.\n\u201cI am not in favor of banning books within FCPS,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cThe primary purpose of our public education system is to expose students to a variety of resources, perspectives and experiences to help them develop critical thinking skills and teach them how to think for themselves.\u201d\nDisagreements like the one between Angolia and Gallagher can be found in school board races across the state. Conservative school board candidates who want to remove books dealing with gender identity, racism and other socially sensitive topics from school library shelves are running in at least 11 of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties, according to a Capital News Service survey of the candidates.\u00a0\nBut those socially conservative school board candidates are in the minority. About 25% of the 102 candidates who responded to the CNS survey said they favor banning some controversial books from school libraries \u2013 but about 41% opposed doing so. Meanwhile, about 30% chose a middle path, saying they trust the review process that screens books, or that they think that age should be a factor when deciding what is allowed in schools.\nThe scope of the debate\nSome of the books that are prompting the debate in Maryland and beyond are quite different from what your grandparents would borrow from their high school libraries.\u00a0\n\u201cGender Queer\u201d is a graphic novel by nonbinary author Maia Kobabe about finding one\u2019s gender identity and experiencing sex for the first time.\u00a0 \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d is the story of a queer Black kid, George M. Johnson, who describes their first intimate sexual experience after being assaulted by classmates in a high school bathroom.\nHundreds of schools have already banned either one or both of the books. Maryland\u2019s Wicomico County school board took action against \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue.\u201d\n\u201cWe found two copies in two high school libraries and removed them. We had no objections about their removal,\u201d said Ann Brittingham Suthowski, who is running for reelection in the county\u2019s District 4.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\n\u201cGender Queer\u201d and \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d are among the most banned books in the country, according to The New York Times and \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d author Johnson\u2019s website.\nHowever, the American Library Association this year released a survey that said 71% of voters are against any sort of book banning. The CNS survey shows plenty of Maryland candidates are against it, too.\n\u201cNo education has ever been furthered due to the banning of a book,\u201d said Emily Jackson, a Talbot County candidate.\n\u2018Education Not Indoctrination\u2019\nIn addition to voicing concerns about books with sexual content, conservative candidates complain about \u201cindoctrination\u201d in books that, they say, promote critical race theory: a college-level academic theory that examines the impact racism has had on American history, laws and policies.\nIn Frederick County, three board candidates \u2013 Angolia, Nancy Allen and Cindy Rose \u2013 are running together as the \u201cEducation Not Indoctrination\u201d slate. The 1776 Action PAC, a conservative group backing like-minded school board candidates nationwide, is backing the right-wing slate in Frederick County, as is Dan Cox, the Republican candidate for governor.\nRose said at an Oct. 14 school board meeting that she wants to ban 35 books from schools, the Frederick News-Post reported. The list, which can be found here, includes Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s anti-war classic \u201cSlaughterhouse Five\u201d and \u201cJesus Land: A Memoir,\u201d which details growing up in an interracial family, as well as several books with LGBTQ+ themes.\nThe conservative candidates object to \u201cGender Queer\u201d because it includes a drawing of an older man and a younger man with their legs intertwined, along with a drawing of two young males engaged in a sexual act.\n\u201cWe recently got \u2018Gender Queer\u2019 removed from one of our school libraries. It\u2019s not just vulgar, it meets the federal definition of \u2018pornography,\u2019 \u201d Rose said.\nStatewide, only 6.79% of school board candidate survey respondents mentioned LGBTQ+ content or one of the books \u2013 but 29.13% of candidates were concerned about sexually explicit literature.\nWorcester County candidate Katie Addis said such books have no place in school libraries..\u00a0\n\u201cMost of these books in question are meant for \u2018young adults.\u2019 I believe a young adult is someone 18-22 years old no longer enrolled in high school,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no \u2018young adults\u2019 enrolled at school, only minors.\u201d\n\u2018Regressive, myopic and detrimental\u2019\nCandidates like those on the Education Not Indoctrination slate have prompted a backlash, both from progressive activists and candidates who say that such conservative candidates want to take schools back in time.\nIn Baltimore and Frederick counties, the Marylanders for Freedom and Opportunity PAC has launched an ad series pushing back on candidates with \u201cdivisive, dangerous platforms.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOlivia Angolia, Nancy Allen, and Cindy Rose are pushing to censor our teachers and politicize our children\u2019s education. Don\u2019t let them take us in the wrong direction,\u201d the ad says.\nThat concern about removing school library materials is shared by many candidates across the counties, including Jonathan Briggs, a candidate from Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s District 2. \n\u201cI am a firm believer that any book that challenges a student\u2019s perspective is a good opportunity for them to ask questions and investigate the subject matter further to become more knowledgeable about it,\u201d Briggs said.\nSome candidates even said book banning is a blatant form of censorship.\n\u00a0\u201cBanning books is regressive, myopic and detrimental to society as well,\u201d said Leonard Arvi], a candidate in Wicomico County\u2019s District 3. \u201cBanning books is a fascism and has no place in democratic, open society.\u201d\n\u00a0A middle way\nOther candidates offered a more nuanced approach to selecting or rejecting school library materials.\nSeveral candidates surveyed said that school library books should be age-appropriate, as determined by the media specialists the district employs. Many candidates referred to either the Maryland Library Blueprint or the American Association of School Libraries, both of which have guidelines regarding which books should be included in a public school\u2019s library system.\nThe Maryland School Library Media Standards for Learners, Librarians and Libraries, from the Maryland Library Blueprint, does not explicitly state age minimums for certain genres or contents of books. Instead, the focus is on the overall curiosity and education level of the student.\nStill, several candidates said that what\u2019s right for older students may not be right for younger students.\n\u201cI never endorse banning books or free speech,\u201d said Steve Whisler, a board candidate in Carroll County. \u201cThat said, I do firmly believe that we should limit student access to books that parents and educators deem not age-appropriate.\u201d\nIn most counties, a book can be challenged by a parent or community member and it will be reviewed by the Board of Education. That\u2019s exactly what happens in Montgomery County.\n\u201cIn the event that a parent or staff question the appropriateness of a book, an ad hoc evaluation committee is convened to reevaluate materials whose appropriateness has been questioned,\u201d said Karla Silvestre , an incumbent at-large board member running for reelection in Montgomery County.\nBut that evaluation process should not strictly limit the kinds of books that students can read, said Jane E. Lichter, a board candidate in Baltimore County\u2019s District 2.\n\u201cIt is critical that books are available for students to read about the world in which they live, as well as books that help students understand lives that are different than their own,\u201d Lichter said.\nCNS reporters Danielle Hodes and Jenna Bloom contributed to this report.\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School partnered Thursday with K-12 schools across southern Maryland to host a question and answer session with astronauts aboard the International Space Station.\u00a0\nAstronauts Nicole A. Mann, Frank Rubio, and Josh Cassada of the Expedition 68 Space Station Crew participated live in the space-to-earth downlink call, aired on NASA Television.\u00a0\nTest pilots under instruction and students from seven Maryland schools pre-recorded videos at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, asking a variety of questions of the astronauts.\nLt. Erin Loft, a test pilot student, asked about the hardest part of adapting to microgravity conditions aboard the ISS, and Mann, the first Native American woman in space, showed off the strips of velcro sewn onto the astronaut\u2019s pants.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can imagine, you\u2019re such a mess when you\u2019re trying to get something done,\u201d Mann said, because the air flow and microgravity inside the station makes tools float away.\nThe astronauts gave Mann\u2019s niece, Brooklyn, a glimpse of daily life on the ISS, where Mann said the day starts with breakfast at 6 a.m. before an \u201cincredibly packed, but very rewarding\u201d 12 hours of work, including maintenance of the station and the science experiments aboard.\n\u201cNo day is like any other day, we get to do lots of different jobs. Sometimes we get to play chief medical officer, sometimes we get to play plumber or electrician, but above all things we get to play scientist,\u201d Rubio said.\nCrew members monitor space station research experiments from a wide range of disciplines. A third grade student at Leonardtown Elementary School asked what experiments the astronauts are most excited to work on in space.\nOn Expedition 68, Rubio said, there are efforts underway to develop organs in space, and to grow tomato plants.\u00a0\nRubio, who launched on the Russian Soyuz MS-22 last month, said he recently harvested the first tomato grown in space. Lt. Jordan Hernandez asked how involved the astronauts are in decision making with the experiments.\n\u201cUp here, we kind of find ourselves in the role of a grad student,\u201d Cassada said. Crew members follow guidance from scientists on the ground to further the experiments, but also lend their own insights from space.\nThe skills that Mann learned at test pilot school are \u201c100% applicable everyday,\u201d she told student Connor, because the astronauts have to be adaptable and learn quickly in order to execute their tasks and communicate results.\nCmdr. Jeremy DeBons, commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, said that nearly 100 graduates of the school have gone on to become NASA astronauts.\nBoth Mann and Cassada are graduates of the school, and served as test pilots in the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy before joining the expedition.\nIn their limited free time, Cassada said the crew enjoys playing with their meals in microgravity, making calls back to Earth to keep up with their families, and sneaking peeks out of the station windows.\u00a0\n\u201cLooking out that window, at Earth and looking at that atmosphere, you realize how lucky we are to live on planet Earth. It is quite a place and we need to protect it,\u201d Cassada said.\nIn addition to the test pilot school, the Maryland schools participating in the call were Leonardtown Elementary School, Hollywood Elementary School, Town Creek Elementary School in Lexington Park, Evergreen Elementary School in California, Dowell Elementary School in Lusby, and the Chesapeake Charter School and Esperanza Middle School, both in Lexington Park.",

    "summary": "Despite widespread deployment and support from school board candidates, there is no empirical evidence that school resource officers enhance safety in Maryland schools. Candidates also emphasized the need for improved mental health services to address school safety concerns.",
    "content": "Amid nationwide concern about school shootings and other violent incidents, all 24 Maryland school districts have employed school resource officers at some time since the 2016-2017 school year, and all but one retain them still.\nBut now, at least five years on, the state says it has no proof that resource officers make schools safer.\u00a0\n\u201cIn Maryland, we have no data on whether or not actual school resource officers are effective (or) work or don\u2019t work,\u201d said Michael Rudinski, regional training and certification specialist for the Maryland Center for School Safety.\nEven so, in a recent survey conducted by the Capital News Service, 34 school board candidates across the state cited school resource officers as the key to school safety. All 102 candidates who participated agreed that school safety is a problem that needs to be addressed, and many candidates suggested increased access to mental health services as another possible solution.\nThe survey also asked the candidates what the most important issue facing their school board is. Ten responded with school safety. The only issues that ranked more often as most important were pandemic-related learning loss, overall academic performance and the teacher shortage.\nSchool resource officers\nRudinski explained that before the state\u2019s Safe to Learn Act of 2018, there was no real definition of resource officers. The act defines school resource officers as law enforcement officers who have \u201ca memorandum of understanding between a local law enforcement agency and a local school system\u201d or who belong to the Baltimore City School Police Department.\nUnder the Safe to Learn Act, Rudinski\u2019s office at the State Department of Education had trained all school resource officers across the state by Sept. 1, 2019. The Maryland Center for School Safety trains officers to handle sensitive school situations, but school boards may put their own alternative training in place.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\nNot long after all that training concluded, though, the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered the schools. Rudinski said that\u2019s prevented his office from doing any long-term evaluation of how effective school resource officers really are.\nSchool resource officers remain valuable despite the lack of data about their effectiveness, according to Christopher Fraley, Region 2 director for the National Association of School Resource Officers.\u00a0\nHe stressed, though, that resource officers are located in schools to prevent trouble, but not to punish individual students.\n\u201cOne of the biggest things I think that sometimes comes into confusion is that SROs should not be used for disciplinary reasons,\u201d said Fraley, an Allegany County resident whose wife, Tammy Fraley, serves on Allegany County\u2019s Board of Education.\nSROs and the candidates\nSchool board candidates from across the state frequently mentioned school resource officers as the best way to keep schools safe. But those school cops do different things in different places, prompting some candidates to express concerns about how those officers are being used.\nA Baltimore County District 4 candidate, Samay Kindra, said he was concerned that the county leads the state in arrests by resource officers.\n\u201cThis highlights the problem of unclear delineation between situations where law enforcement intervention is appropriate and where school-based administrative procedures are appropriate,\u201d Kindra said.\nHoward County candidate Linfeng Chen, however, said resource officers play a vital role, especially now with the national concern about school staff shortages.\n\u201cSchool resource officers are important to maintaining a safe environment for students to learn,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt makes sense to have SROs now more than ever if we consider staff shortages and increased school fighting and acting out issues.\u201d\u00a0\nMontgomery County stationed officers in schools beginning in 2002, prompted by the Columbine High School shootings in 1999, but in 2021 \u2013 amid criticism that students of color were disproportionately subjected to discipline from SROs \u2013 the in-house school officer program was ended.\n\nDisparate Maryland school board candidates united on teacher shortage concerns\n\nNow Montgomery County has another form of school resource officers called community engagement officers. The engagement officers are not permanently stationed inside schools, but schools can make requests for them to come to schools when needed.\nBut some Montgomery board candidates suggested that may not be enough. Scott Joftus, an incumbent board member running for re-election in District 3, said more unarmed security officials may be needed in the county\u2019s schools. And Joftus\u2019 opponent, Julie Yang, also called for changes.\n\u201cRecent incidents have exposed the need to improve our schools\u2019 intercom system, training for staff on safety protocol procedures, and crisis communication with the community,\u201d Yang said.\nOther safety measures\nOther candidates stressed that school safety doesn\u2019t begin and end with school resource officers. Many board hopefuls suggested expanding access to mental health resources in the state\u2019s schools, while others suggested combining that with additional security measures.\n\u201cWe need to make sure our buildings are safe, but we also need to address the mental health crisis within our student population,\u201d said Karin Miller, a board candidate in Wicomico County\u2019s District 2. \u201cIt should not be a question of school resource officers OR social workers; they both have a role to play in creating a safe atmosphere within our schools.\u201d\u00a0\nRae Gallagher, a board candidate in Frederick County, agreed.\n\u201cSafety of school buildings is extremely important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most effective strategies to reduce school shootings include incorporating programming that addresses student mental health, training teachers and educators on recognizing signs that a student may be considering harming oneself or others, ensuring that school buildings are secure, and partnering with policymakers at the state level on common sense gun laws.\u201d\u00a0\nOther candidates stressed that school resource officers and mental health access are just parts of what should be a comprehensive approach to school safety.\n\u201cI will continue to advocate for funding for new clean energy school buildings that are built with the features of secure front entrances and modern doors and locks; improve safe walking paths to schools and advocate for a fully staffed crossing guard program; promote mitigating COVID-19 spread through a high vaccine rate; and, support budgets with increased services for bullying prevention and restorative approaches to conflict resolution,\u201d said Pamela Boozer-Strother, who is running for re-election in Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s District 3.\n\nSchool board candidates cite learning loss, student performance as biggest issues\n\nLuc Angelot, a candidate in Wicomico County\u2019s District 1, said school safety has been on his mind for half his life.\n\u201cI am very concerned about school safety,\u201d said Angelot, who\u2019s 18 years old. \u201cI was 9 years old when the Sandy Hook shooting took place. My generation grew up fearing a possible shooting happening at any moment.\u201d\nThat being the case, Angelot said, school safety has to be a top priority.\n\u201cFrom my plan to make mental health a priority to continuing to work with local law enforcement, retrofitting our buildings to be well secured, and taking social media threats seriously, we can do things to make sure students feel safe,\u201d he said.\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "summary": "Maryland's school board candidates across political spectrums agree that addressing the teacher shortage is a top priority, citing the need to recruit and retain quality teachers with higher salaries and improved working conditions. The issue is particularly pressing as an average of 10% of teachers did not return in the 2021-2022 school year, leaving many districts with significant vacancies.",
    "content": "From Maryland\u2019s western panhandle to its Eastern Shore \u2013 and from the political right to the left \u2013 Maryland\u2019s school board candidates agree that the teacher shortage is one of the key issues they will have to confront if elected.\n\u201cWe need to recruit and, especially, retain teachers and other staff,\u201d said Linda Murray, who\u2019s running in Washington County. \u201cPeople are leaving for higher-paying, less stressful jobs.\u201d\n\u201cThe greatest indicator for student success is the presence of a quality teacher in the classroom\u00a0 \u2013 this is the greatest challenge facing us in Talbot County,\u201d said Emily Jackson, an Eastern Shore candidate.\nThe nationwide post-pandemic teacher shortage is an issue throughout Maryland for a reason. The Maryland State Department of Education reported that in the 2021-2022 school year, an average of 10% of teachers did not return.\nThat statistic explains why Maryland school board candidates who replied to a Capital News Service survey largely agreed that they need to do something about the teacher shortage if elected. Many say higher teacher salaries are an obvious solution.\nA statewide dilemma\nIn Maryland and many school districts across the country, job postings for teacher positions are lengthy \u2013 and school board candidates said they worry the lists will grow longer still. Many school board candidates say teacher morale is running on empty following the COVID-19 pandemic, and pay often does not serve as motivation.\nAs of Aug. 15, almost every county reported at least one teacher vacancy. Prince George\u2019s County reported the most, at 900 vacancies. Baltimore City reported 240 vacancies.\nIn the Capital News Service survey, of the 21 Maryland counties plus Baltimore City in which candidates participated, 15 had at least one candidate that cited teacher retention/recruitment as one of the most important issues facing their school board.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\nApril Christina Curley, who\u2019s running in Baltimore City, said it is important to hire qualified educators and keep them on staff for the long term because it helps the city\u2019s students. If the district has a large number of experienced teachers, \u201cwe know that our children will reap the benefits in very tangible, measured ways,\u201d she said.\nDiane Alvarez, a candidate in Harford County\u2019s District F, said that when teachers decide to leave, it creates chaos in the classroom. To foster more stability, she said, the school board needs to improve teacher retention and figure out why teachers are leaving.\n\u201cFor me, looking for a position on the school board, that\u2019s one of the first questions I want to know,\u201d Alvarez said in an interview.\nCharles County reported 194 teacher vacancies at the end of the 2021-2022 school year, meaning that 10% of teaching positions were vacant. Four of the nine candidates from Charles County who answered the survey said the county needs to focus on teacher retention and increasing teacher salaries.\n\u201cWe need to make teachers and staff feel respected and motivated to teach and remain in Charles County,\u201d said candidate Yonelle Moore Lee.\nA variety of solutions\nWhile candidates are united in their belief that teacher retention and recruitment are problems, they offer a variety of ideas for addressing them. Some hope new state legislation will resolve them, but others have different ideas.\nThe state recently adopted the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, legislation that aims to improve the quality of education in Maryland by increasing funding $3.8 billion each year for a decade. Each Maryland county is responsible for locally implementing the policy, and the Blueprint\u2019s accountability board will oversee this process.\nThe Blueprint includes a section on teacher salaries that aims to incentivize existing teachers to remain in place. It also aims to make teacher compensation more comparable to other fields with similar education requirements.\nBy 2024, the Blueprint will initially increase teacher salaries by 10% before a minimum salary of $60,000 is required by July 1, 2026.\nAs a result, some board candidates saw the Blueprint as the be-all, end-all solution to the education issues facing the state.\n\u201cThe most important issue is the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future,\u201d said David Plotts, who is running in Wicomico County\u2019s District 4.\nYet for other candidates, the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future is not the end of the discussion on teachers\u2019 salaries. Some said that increasing salaries is the best way to retain staff, and the Blueprint only begins to address the salary issue.\nCurley, the Baltimore candidate, said school boards will have to make big-time investments to keep educators in the classroom.\n\nSchool board candidates cite learning loss, student performance as biggest issues\n\n\u201cBringing in qualified educators and working to keep them in the classroom will require a drastic and radical commitment from the school board to significantly increase the base salary for teachers with opportunities for achievable performance bonuses, offering a manageable workload with supportive administrators,\u201d she said.\nHoward County candidate Jacky McCoy said another potential solution is the \u201cgrow your own\u201d teacher program, in which schools aim to recruit current students and community members as future teachers.\nAlvarez noted that the state, in planning for the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s future, found that many teachers leave the profession after two years \u2013 \u201cwith no data as to why.\u201d\nShe said school districts need to do research to answer that question and to prevent teachers from leaving.\n\u201cInterview each teacher, administrators and staff to determine expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cEmploy expectation management (a management tool that aims to keep employers and employees in sync in terms of goals) in areas needed and monitor teacher needs in terms of resources and mental health.\u201d\nThe issue of teacher shortages transcends ideological lines. Alvarez worries that critical race theory is being taught in her county schools and that sexually explicit material should be removed from school libraries.\nAnd yet on the teacher recruitment and retention issue, she agrees with Montgomery County Board of Education Vice President Karla Silvestre, who praises the \u201canti-bias and anti-racist curriculum\u201d in the county schools and who trusts librarians to decide which books should be allowed in school libraries.\n\u00a0\u201dWe have to recruit and retain the best talent to work with our students,\u201d said Silvestre, who\u2019s running for re-election to an at-large board seat. \u201cGreat teachers and principals change lives and transform schools.\u201d\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "summary": "Despite differing views on cultural issues, many Maryland school board candidates agree that pandemic-related learning loss and academic recovery are the most pressing issues facing schools. This focus on learning loss reflects a statewide concern, impacting every child and taking precedence over social issues like critical race theory.",
    "content": "Steve Whisler and Jenni Pompi stand on opposite sides of the cultural divide roiling school board races in Maryland and nationwide. Whisler objects to what he called the \u201c1619 Project curriculum\u201d that focuses on the role of racism in America\u2019s founding, while Pompi praises schools that teach students about \u201cthe disenfranchisement and marginalization of Black, brown and indigenous people.\u201d\nBut Whisler and Pompi agree on one thing: The most important issue facing Maryland\u2019s schools isn\u2019t their approach to race or the kinds of books students can check out of school libraries.\n\u201cThe most pressing issue in our county relates to learning loss,\u201d Whisler, a Carroll County Board of Education candidate, said.\n\u201cThe most important issue facing our school board (is) student recovery from the pandemic learning gap,\u201d said Pompi, who is running for the school board in Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s District 2.\nThey are among some 102 Maryland school board candidates who responded to a Capital News Service survey on education issues \u2013 and 16 named learning loss stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic as the key issue facing schools in their district. Another 16 cited other academic performance issues as most important.\nMeanwhile, only 11 cited social issues, such as critical race theory and books about sexuality in school libraries, as the most important issues facing their schools.\n\nRead about local candidates\u2019 views in our Board of Education Voter Guide.\n\nThat may come as a surprise after tensions about critical race theory and library books erupted at school board meetings in many states last year. But the concerns about pandemic-related learning loss, and academic performance in general, come as no surprise to Susan Getty, vice president of the Maryland State Board of Education.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big issue for the candidates because it literally affected every child,\u201d Getty said in an interview.\nA statewide concern\nThe candidates\u2019 concerns about learning loss span the state as well as the political spectrum. Candidates in 10 Maryland counties, from Allegany County in Western Maryland to Wicomico County on the Eastern Shore, named learning loss as the top issue in the CNS survey.\n\u201cThe most important issue facing the school board is addressing the impact of school closures and remote learning on students\u2019 education and proficiency rates in math and reading,\u201d said Esther L. Wells, who is running for the school board in Montgomery County\u2019s District 1.\nThe focus on learning loss comes at a turning point for public education in Maryland and across the country.\nThe debates about the teaching of the nation\u2019s racial history, along with parental concerns about books about sexual identity, have energized school board races in Maryland as well as nationwide. The CNS survey responses, along with a review of the websites of candidates who did not respond to the survey, show that social conservatives are now running for board seats in at least 13 of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties.\nGiven the newfound intensity surrounding school board races, the new Local News Network at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism sent questionnaires to all 155 state school board candidates running in the Nov. 8 election for this Capital News Service project.\nCandidates were asked open-ended questions about the top education issue, the teaching of history, the removal of books from school libraries, school safety and other key matters. The candidates\u2019 answers are detailed in a voter guide published on the CNS website and available for republication by any news organization in the state.\nLearning loss and overall student performance emerged as the top issues in the survey even though it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how far behind students fell. Because of the pandemic, the State Department of Education did not release its county-by-county school report cards \u2013 its most comprehensive look at how students are learning \u2013 in 2020 or 2021.\n\u201cData on student achievement during those two years is not available to the public, and one can only guess how far our students have fallen behind,\u201d said Donna Nizolek, who is running for the school board in Talbot County\u2019s District 3.\nThe Department of Education said it plans to release test score results for the 2021-2022 school year in January. But Getty, of the State Board of Education, said a few measurements show that Maryland is following the national trend of learning loss due to the pandemic.\nAmong them is the 2021 Kindergarten Readiness Assessment, which showcased that there are more students than before the pandemic who need targeted extra support to be ready for school, Getty said. Fifth and eighth grade students also lacked proficiency in science, according to testing this year.\nNationwide, NWEA, a nonprofit school testing organization, reported that students in the 2021-2022 school year graded 5 to 10 percentile points lower in math than they would in a typical year, while grading 2 to 4 points lower in reading.\nGetty said the state is trying to address the learning loss issue by targeting students who need help the most. She said the state has received funding from the federal government for COVID-19 recovery, which is being spent on increased mental health services as well as tutoring and summer programs aimed at bridging the achievement gap.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to go back and recapture what we used to do,\u201d Getty said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to move forward and do a better job at educating the underserved students.\u201d\nWhat the candidates say\nMany school board candidates stressed, though, that pandemic-related learning loss is only part of a problem that emerged long ago.\n\u201cThe most important issue we face is the failing education system in place,\u201d said John Abbott, a social conservative running for the Board of Education in Worcester County on the Eastern Shore. \u201cHigh percentages of students in Worcester County are not proficient in math and reading.\u201d\nAbbott also expressed concerns about sexually explicit books in school libraries. But even candidates who are not making social issues central to their campaigns, such as Robin Harvey, shared Abbott\u2019s worries about what kids are learning \u2013 or not learning.\n\u201cStudent performance is the most important issue facing public education,\u201d said Harvey, who is running in Baltimore County\u2019s District 1.\nCandidates offered a wide variety of suggestions as to how schools in the state can help students perform better.\n\u201cStrategies to improve performance and close the performance gap include ensuring that schools have qualified/certified teachers, supporting thriving and active parent participation programs, using data to direct resources, supporting all students in their learning, and applying consistent standards across all schools for construction and renovation,\u201d Harvey said.\nKarin Miller, a candidate running in Wicomico County\u2019s District 2, said the way to solve this issue is by attracting and retaining quality teachers while also striving to improve the classroom atmosphere.\n\u201cCreating a safe environment where students are able to learn without distraction improves learning outcomes for all,\u201d she said.\nMiller was one of several board candidates who raised concerns about student discipline and its impact on academic performance.\nMike Lukas, who is running for reelection to the Charles County Board of Education, said: \u201cI have obligated funding for counselors and psychologists to help students deal with the effects of not interacting with students for over a year, which manifests itself in disciplinary issues.\u201d\nLukas also said special efforts need to be made to get students back to grade level in reading and math.\nMeanwhile in Howard County, candidate Dan Newberger said he wants the district to \u201cdevelop and implement comprehensive, tailored, data-driven pandemic recovery plans for every school.\u201d\nAnd Russ Johnson, who is running in Cecil County\u2019s District 5, said students have fallen behind and the district must refocus its efforts on a rigorous and high-standard program of instruction. Johnson said that this would require school employees to spend time in the classroom and tutoring students who need the most help.\n\u00a0\u201cAn all-hands-on-deck approach will be necessary,\u201d Johnson said.\u00a0\n\nMore Coverage\n\u2013 Board of Education Voter Guide\n\u2013 All Election 2022 stories",

    "content": "Campaign email: joshuahinebaugh@gmail.com\nAge: 45\nEmployment: Senior specialist in plant automation at Viatris, a pharmaceutical company.\u00a0\nEducation: Associate\u2019s degree in computer information management from a technical college called Computer Tech in Fairmont, West Virginia.\u00a0\nWhy are you running for school board?\nI think our school board and members need to have more transparency. Get the parents more involved. So, I have a 10-year-old daughter currently in the school system and kind of feel like we\u2019re on the outside looking in. \u2026 I\u2019m just running to help provide that transparency and try to make the best decisions for our schools.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the school board?\nI think I\u2019ll be a good candidate because I\u2019ll question everything. I\u2019m not just going to go with the status quo just because, let\u2019s say, the state or federal government will give us money for the program. I\u2019m going to ask questions as to why we\u2019re getting that money or why they decided to do that if it indeed would be the best fit for our students.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nRonald Reagan is probably one of the best leaders that I\u2019ve ever lived under\u2026. I was young whenever he was in office, but I just liked everything he stood for and how he handled himself, and he was just a good, cool-headed, calm president.\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nSo currently one of the biggest issues facing our school board is school closures in our area. Our school utilization is way down, and that\u2019s just due to the declining younger population. I\u2019d like to be able to somehow fix or keep the teachers that are here. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest issues as we lose our population, so then we\u2019re forced to close down schools. So if we can have better-paying either teacher jobs or just jobs in the area in general, that will keep the younger generation here in the area.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\nSchool safety is always an issue. I mean, you never know, you never know even with the safety resource officers there, you just kind of never know what can happen. I mean, there are a lot of crazy people in the world so what I\u2019d like to do is work more with local law enforcement officers or find a way to get more safety resource officers in the schools. Currently, we have a couple of areas where we only have one officer dedicated to two schools \u2026 trying to find funding for that for more resources somehow, some way \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that looks like at this point.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nI think we\u2019re going away from what everyone was brought up and taught, we\u2019re going more toward critical race. I think that\u2019s probably what this question was about, critical race theory. So, I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding of what critical race theory is, it\u2019s not white or Black, it\u2019s about the laws that were made pertaining mainly to the white man which is, I don\u2019t feel that that\u2019s the truth. Honestly, I think we need to get back to our roots and actually teach why, and how things went on. So, they always say history repeats itself. So how can we improve that to make that known?\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nI don\u2019t necessarily think that any books should be removed. If someone has a view and they want to read about it, that\u2019s fine. As long as they\u2019re age-appropriate, I\u2019m fine with that.",

It is appropriate for them to do a good and honest job and put every possible effort into their position.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI believe the most pressing and important issue facing our school board right now is the correction of the trajectory of our students\u2019 learning. We lost a lot of ground to the pandemic declaration and students have lost valuable time and experience in the classroom.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it? \u00a0\nI am intensely concerned about school safety. We very recently had at least two, major, violent incidents at our schools and one of those ended in a death. I am hearing more and more (directly from parents and students) that students are concerned to even visit restrooms for fear of physical harm. This needs fixed. We should involve experts who can guide our board toward solutions and take it to the parents for input.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nLike most parents, I have been keeping an eye on what is taught in our classrooms. I have noticed that groups from all sides of issues appear to be using our classrooms as a battleground to espouse their varied philosophies\u2026 and sometimes, that may mean that they want to modify, influence, or even censor historical accounts. I want a fair and open treatment of history, taught as reality and fact.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed? \u00a0\nThis seems to be a hotbed issue that arises now and then, and I do not think there is a simple answer to this. There are circumstances where books and topics have been considered inappropriate due to sexual content, violent content, and the like, and have been removed by schools and libraries. I believe that this all comes down to age-appropriate exposure to materials and perhaps that is where the real focus needs to be placed. Do we have a legitimate reason to ask these questions? Absolutely.",

    "content": "Campaign email: jlawlerheavner@gmail.com\nAge: 68\nEmployment: I am currently retired, but volunteer regularly in local food pantries, vaccine efforts, and literacy tutoring.\nEducation: Master of Science in Public Health from University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI believe that a strong public education is the foundation of a civil society. Upon retirement and upon moving back to my hometown, I began seeking ways to give back to the community that gave me a strong foundation. The Board of Education is a key backbone of a community. Allegany County Public Schools employ many talented and dedicated professionals and staff. The Maryland Blueprint for Education presents a unique opportunity to raise the bar for educating our future citizens and for bridging gaps in rural and lower income economic settings. I want to be a part of that change.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy background in public health, my dedication to raising the bar of civil conversations, my intention to set good examples for our youth, and my experience in working with individuals from varied backgrounds make me a particularly strong candidate for leading our local public schools forward as we continue to emerge from a global pandemic.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nFlorence Nightingale was a public figure who I continue to admire. She is the founder of modern nursing and also a statistician. She led a revolution in healthcare by proving that hospitals that were dirty and served poor food were just as dangerous (and sometimes more so!) than the injuries of the wounded soldiers that she cared for during the Crimean war! Data-based decisions can indeed lead to life-saving practices!\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe past two and half years have brought new challenges for coming together as a society to beat back a communicable disease that has threatened our health and safety. Both teachers and students have experienced losses as a result. Forging and improving community partnerships can help students recover from educational deficits that they experienced during this time. Likewise, providing educators, counselors, and safety officers with the resources they need can go a long way toward facing these challenges going forward.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSafety is a significant concern when school shootings have become so frequent. Children cannot learn when they do not feel safe. Allegany County has added security officers and School Resource Officers while simultaneously increasing the number of school psychologists and counselors, thus creating a safer environment for students to grow and learn about the world and themselves. Being \u2018different\u2019 need not lead to bullying and social isolation, which can then lead to low self-esteem, resentment, and harm. Increased presence of authority and mental health professionals will go a long way towards making everyone feel safer at school.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nAs long as history is taught in truth and in context, students can become critical thinkers and understand not only the past, but also the present and how history influences the future. I believe this is the current model in our county. When we know better, we can do better.\u00a0\nIt seems that this question is probing for an opinion regarding critical race theory. This is not a topic that is taught at the primary or secondary level, so this is not a legitimate concern.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nStudents should be encouraged to read from a broad palette of genres, authors, and perspectives. Banning books leads to limiting freedom of thought and, therefore, education. It is an authoritarian method leading to thought control, and is a dangerous practice. At the same time, students should be encouraged to discuss and question what they read. This is what learning is all about!",

I am running for school board to ensure (1) all students receive an equitable and quality educational experience; (2) educators feel supported, respected and prepared to deliver with and for families; (3) families feel proud and at ease sending their students to school, and (4) our education system prioritizes continuous improvement in teaching, learning, and leadership with excellence as the standard.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI believe that classroom context is a value-add to any board providing oversight of a system where successful cycles of teaching and learning is a core component of organizational success. My experience includes recent classroom and leadership experience, which is extremely important given the changes and challenges in the education landscape since the start of the pandemic. With multi-level experience leading as an instructional coach, managing a congressional education portfolio, serving on executive boards of local education councils and coalitions and currently managing collaborative work projects in learning and developmental sciences, I am well positioned for the board.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nI admire Congresswoman Alma Adams\u2019 lifelong commitment to education and how she has used those relevant experiences to help shape meaningful policy. (Adams is a North Carolina Democrat). She consistently promotes a quality education for all students.\u00a0 When I was managing a congressional education portfolio, I did not work for her office but was privileged enough to see her in action through committee and caucus work. Each time was inspiring. She proved to be a bold, consistent and unwavering leader and warrior for education, and the intersectionality of issues impacting education.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue facing the school board is school safety. I say this broadly because safety is the catalyst for a positive school climate that directly impacts academic performance and can include all issues ranging from nutrition to the school-to-prison pipeline. More narrowly focused, I would establish a school safety workgroup to work as a collaborative partner to the existing school safety task force to ensure consideration of ongoing problems of practice, strengthen multi-tiered systems of integrated supports to be used to inform comprehensive student-centered safety plans in partnership with targeted community school efforts, and root MCS\u00a0 (Managing Crisis Safely) training in learning & development sciences.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is one of my top issues on my platform. In addition to the aforementioned, I would ensure intentional emphasis and supports to ensure schools are on the pathway to reach Optimally Safe School Status, Common Sense Schools status, and increased district membership in the M.A.S.R.O (Maryland Association of School Resource Officers) to ensure co-creation of best practices with relevant context as a necessary stopgap to long-term approaches.\u00a0\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nBased on the descriptions of the Maryland State Standards and Framework, each standard emphasizes inquiry, and I believe that to be a positive approach to allowing students to become critical consumers and empowered learners.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nLibraries should include a range of books that allow students to explore, learn and make meaning of the world around them and/or reimagine a world.",

There are many parents so afraid to speak up, so I will be their voice.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI admire ALL of the parents who are standing up for their children and not backing down. I admire the teachers who teach a child how to think and not what to think. We as a society have lost the ability to think for ourselves because many were never taught critical thinking skills.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nTwo words, Parental Rights.\u00a0\nA parent should be the voice advocating for their child, not a teachers union. Politics and indoctrination of any kind need to be removed from the classroom. Our children are too far behind and schools should be teaching academics, not broadcasting their political affiliations to their students. The No. 1 question I get asked by parents is my stance on CRT (Critical Race Theory) being taught within the classroom. My response is NO I do not believe, along with the majority of parents, that CRT does not belong in our schools.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it? \u00a0\nSchool safety is a major issue. We need to be proactive instead of reactive. Parents, police and school officials need to sit down and work out issues that are noticed at different schools. I am also NOT for police reform that wants to allocate the money given to SROs into \u201cother areas.\u201d We need more officers within our schools, not less.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy concern is that not all history is being taught and major gaps are either being left out or rewritten. Parents also want access to their children\u2019s curriculum and want to know why everything is so secretive. Bottom line is they want to know what their children are learning in school and how to find that information without going down a rabbit hole that leads nowhere.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, there are oversexualized books that do not belong in our schools. For example \u201cGender Queer\u201d is an inappropriate book that illustrates sexual acts and is highly inappropriate for minors. Parents should be made aware of what books are entering their children\u2019s libraries instead of them being kept in the dark of what books their children has access to.",

However, improving third grade reading proficiency is highly important as it determines a child\u2019s life trajectory. Third grade reading proficiency is correlated with high school dropout, continued poverty, criminal activity, and behavioral concerns. In order to increase third grade proficiency, we must improve kindergarten readiness. This entails improving community educational programs, child care center, Head Start. Once students arrive in kindergarten we must improve teaching and learning from grades K-3 to ensure students are proficient by the spring assessment window.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is the utmost important in education. We need to ensure that as a district we open the lines of communication about any possible threats to the school. All threats should be taken seriously, in addition (to) practicing safety drills, and deploying safety mechanisms to reduce the chances of violence occurring, will be key.\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe that all aspects of history should be taught, the good and the bad.

In my tenure on this board, we have successfully secured all school entry vestibules, air-conditioned the remaining schools (which allows all doors and windows to remain closed and locked) and provided many hours of safety training for all school personnel.

I also have visited classrooms and seen firsthand what we are teaching.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nIf we are apprised of a book that a parent or other citizen believes is in a school library and should be removed; we have a policy and process in place to review said book. The policy states the book is reviewed by a committee of parents, teachers and other citizens and they make a recommendation to the superintendent and the board of whether it should be removed.

There needs a better balance of representation for parents and educators using common sense approach to creating good education policy.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbraham Lincoln is a leader that I have admired for many years. Reading \u2018A Team of Rivals\u2019 showed his ability to navigate the political landscape during the Civil War. Lincoln dealt not only with insurgents but also those within his party with different political philosophies. Without his brilliance of knowing when to shove instead of push in the face of public opinion, it\u2019s truly admirable.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nTwo major issues facing Harford County Public Schools: funding and support staff. Harford County has consistently been underfunded for many years even though it ranked among the best in education in Maryland. The pandemic and lack of equitable pay for support staff has resulted in losing support staffers for students with special needs. It has placed a heavier strain on teachers with large classroom sizes and are unable to give as much time needed for special needs students.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nWhile I don\u2019t support the idea of guns on school grounds, I do support school resource officers as a measure of defense against school shootings. Funding and access to mental health professionals is a subject that needs serious discussion.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a student of history, I do not find it comforting how people disregard events in the past. My biggest concern is historical facts being ignored solely because it\u2019s not comforting or easy to understand. History is meant to be a tool to understand events, why they occurred, and the ultimate result of the events. To prevent proper teaching of history is to minimize society\u2019s understanding of the past.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nThe dynamics of school libraries has changed over the years to include not only academic materials, but also diverse coming of age stories that allow people can connect to. I do not support censorship of reading materials so as long as such materials are instructional. I do not believe books should be simply removed just because it contains instances that some people might not be comfortable reading.",

With the nationwide mass exodus from education, we must retain our excellent educators and also recruit their equally excellent peers. We can address this by being the most competitive in terms of pay and benefits, providing our teachers support in the classroom (including increasing instructional assistants), and empowering our teachers with more time to plan, prep and collaborate. We need to take an out-of-the-box look at how to creatively support our teachers and ensure every student in TCPS has a quality teacher leading their class.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nAs a parent of four TCPS students I am, and will always be, concerned about school safety. I am proud of our partnership with local law enforcement to bring more SROs into our schools over the past four years. Reaching each student and giving them connections to the school, a feeling of ownership, and a sense of belonging goes far to create a more connected and safe school community. In order for students to feel and be safe at school we need to attend to all potential safety risks \u2013 from physical security of the buildings, to mental health and wellness, to appropriately addressing bullying, to effective discipline measures.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nHistory needs to be taught accurately and dispassionately. We cannot take sides with history, we just have to be honest about it. We have to acknowledge events that happened and how they shaped what came after. Then that information needs to lead our students to critical thinking, high-level classroom discussions, and greater knowledge. My time in our history classrooms tells me our teachers are doing that, and our AP history scores bear that out. We need more rigorous and engaging material and class options to continue that. What there is no room for in our schools is turning our classrooms into political battlefields to advance or demonize our neighbors.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nNo. First, our librarians are professionals who curate their libraries to reflect age, curriculum, cultural, and content-appropriate books for the students at their schools. Second, books are keys that open minds and need to be accessible to do their job. No education has ever been furthered due to the banning of a book. That said, some students do need guidance to select books that reflect the values and beliefs of their own home, and it falls on parents to help their children understand what their family considers acceptable when it comes to library choices. Not everyone\u2019s choices will be the same, and in removing a book as an option for all, it limits the choice of other students and families.",

I know education opens doors to opportunities that would not be available otherwise. Our education is on the decline, proficiency is down, teachers do not stay in the career, and children\u2019s mental health is suffering.\u00a0 HCPS needs a strong analytical team that has the tenacity to correct the course. I am a mother of two adult boys and a grandmother of two inquisitive toddlers. I want to make sure they get an education that is rich with academic challenge that gives them a path to a vocation. This will secure their future and makes a positive contribution to our country.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am a good candidate because I know how to work collaboratively, identify the variables, solve complex problems, ask good questions, and have integrity that can be trusted. I have 32 year\u2019s career experience as an engineer in testing and evaluation for the Army. I was assigned the number one program in the Army to lead the analysis effort, we were successful. Also, I have worked with young mothers in need of life skills to overcome the challenges of parenting. I taught a course in the Harford Detention System entitled \u201cBecoming a Responsible Mother.\u201d This evolved into a non-profit, Powerful Parenting, offered to parents who desire better skills and want to network with other parents.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nGov. Ron Desantis, because he stood up to Disney for their \u201cwoke\u201d practices. Disney has always provided a world of fantasy and creativity that appeals to children. As such they should be responsible to create an environment free from sexualization. Instead, Disney encouraged free expression to their design team who admitted, intentionally adding inappropriate sexual content. This content was being made available to our youth at all age levels, to include toddlers. Standing up to Disney showed integrity, that he cares about future generations, and he is not in politics for the money. So many politicians go along with big business despite the effect it is having on our country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nMost important issue is teacher retention. Dr. William Kirwan\u2019s proposal (in the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future) is to increase salaries to attract higher quality teachers. I say we need to respect the ones we have and create an environment with decreased toxicity. Dr. Kirwan stated that many teachers leave after two years in the profession, with no data on why. To understand and correct this situation, I would develop a strategy using the Balanced Scorecard Method. Interview each teacher, administrators, and staff to determine expectations. Employ expectation management in areas needed and monitor teacher needs in terms of resources and mental health. Use a volunteerism approach from within school and community to fill needs.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSafety is a number one priority. HCPS has done a good job working with local police for opening and dismissal monitoring, but I am concerned about hallway monitoring and verifying that protocols are being followed. I would like to create hall/entrance monitors that could be fulfilled by volunteers, schools staff, or technology. HCPS has developed an app to alert parents and community of issues at the school, which I think will be helpful in preventing interference with professionals responding to incidents close to school zones. That said, schools need to inform community of this new capability and provide training when needed.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nSince I am not a parent, obtaining specific curriculum is not possible. I am working with the school to obtain a sample of curriculum. That said, I am concerned about a cancel culture that exists both in schools and society. I am concerned that critical race theory is being taught in the schools, creating division rather than assimilation. I am also concerned about the ideologies students identify with, that are counter to the American dream. Many graduates support a socialistic government and no longer have that drive to own a piece of Americana.\u00a0\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes, if a book contains content that is not appropriate for students that have access to the library it should be removed. Any book that is sexually explicit or writes about sexual ideations should be removed. I strongly believe that the over-sexualization of our children is problematic and all attempts to limit exposure are necessary.",

I have been active in our community since high school, and I am committed to the advancement of my community. I have a unique and valuable perspective to bring to the board as a Sikh-Indian American who graduated from BCPS in the recent past and is now a young professional.

Thus, creating my vision for Baltimore County Public Schools, where all students are successful post-graduation and are supplied with the tools to build a better future from an equitable and forward-thinking school system.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI admire former President Barack Obama because I have found inspiration in the way he broke barriers and persevered through great challenges and obstacles to achieve his goals while helping others in the process. He showed that no matter what you look like or where you come from, you can achieve your dreams even in the face of prejudice. Finally, I admire the way he stuck to the issues and policy while fighting the good fight and helping others instead of being torn down by the low-bore attacks that he faced. Everyone can look to President Obama to find an example of how one can carry themselves with grace while persevering through adversity.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most pressing issue within the county school system is ensuring that the school system\u2019s primary focus is on student success after graduating, whether that is through college or other avenues. To accomplish this, we need to do everything we can to ensure Baltimore County Public Schools lives up to the promise of quality education for all by focusing on student well-being, which includes addressing financial literacy within the curriculum and providing adequate mental health education. If we teach students how to manage their wealth and their health, we are setting them up for success no matter their path.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nIt should be a top priority for BCPS to ensure that all students and staff find themselves in a safe and healthy learning environment. BCPS has led Maryland in school arrests by student resource officers (SRO), with the largest arrestable offense being \u201cdisruption.\u201d This highlights the problem of unclear delineation between situations where law enforcement intervention is appropriate and where school-based administrative procedures are appropriate. The board needs to create new, clear policies that dictate what situations are to be addressed by SROs and what offenses are to be dealt with solely by the administration and clearly communicate these changes with SROs, parents and administrations.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nHistory must be taught in the way that it happened. We must teach our students all of our history\u2014good parts and the bad parts. It is essential that we do so, so that we are teaching our kids how to solve the problems of today and tomorrow by learning and understanding the successes and the failures of the past. We can not shy away from issues that make us uncomfortable. It is a disservice to our students and is detrimental to their future. We should not waver in the face of challenges, we need to tackle them head-on and provide a world-class education for our students.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nBooks should not be removed from schools. It is important that all views of the world are represented and available for students to learn about in an educational setting. Banning books runs the risk of compromising a student\u2019s development and stunting their learning and curiosity about the world. Removing books is denying students the chance to understand values and ideas that may not be readily apparent in their daily lives and shying away from issues that make us uncomfortable is contradictory to the goal of setting our students up for future success.",

He admires public leaders like John McCain and Colin Powell for their leadership qualities.",
    "content": "Ethan Loewen\nCampaign email: e.loewen25@yahoo.com\nAge: 47\nEmployment: I am. I don\u2019t want to give out more personal information than what\u2019s on the file. You know what the Board of Elections has.\nEducation: I have some college. I\u2019ve technically I finished three years of college and it was in health care administration.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\nI have a fairly unique set of experiences and skills that are well-rounded for the school board. One, as a manager,\u00a0 I deal with what it is that is needed: the character traits, the skills for people coming out of school in order to be good employees. And I am a financial advisor. So, part of what that deals with is being aware of the changing economy and the skills of the future. And then the other thing is, I was a child with learning disabilities and also some behavioral issues. And then my children were on the exact opposite end of the spectrum: they were in the gifted and talented programs. And the largest portion of my family actually are Hispanics. I have family members that have dealt with coming to America not speaking English as they entered the schools, another hot button topic.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\nWell, the other thing is over the years, I dealt with a lot of teachers and administrators throughout Maryland throughout various states. For years, I\u2019ve been doing that. And so, I get kind of a regular set of feedback from those individuals. And so, I also have a wide perspective, in that regard, with what\u2019s going on in the industry, in different school districts, in different states. And, you know, so I have a constant concern about that. So, it\u2019s really all of those skills combined.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nWell, there are many I do like, but my personal favorites are (the late U.S. senator from Arizona) John McCain and General Colin Powell (the late Secretary of State under President George W. Bush). Obviously part of that is because when a lot of my social and political identity was being developed, they were very prominent, but those are probably the two that I would say the most. And it\u2019s because they had standards. I\u2019m also a veteran, they obviously are veterans. They were very strong leaders. They were very flexible thinkers. And they also understood\u00a0 the American ideals. And they did a very good job of guiding America in the right direction.\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nEquity is the biggest issue. The problem with equity is that it\u2019s very much misunderstood. They divide everyone up into groups based on race, gender, sexual orientation. Certain groups are portrayed as being victims, while other groups are portrayed as being, quote, \u201cprivileged.\u201d With my learning disability, they have a name for me called neurodivergent. I received the assistance I needed. It wasn\u2019t easy. Over a period of a couple of years, it worked very well. The thing is that when I read how equity ideology is applied to the children with my problems of this generation, it would not have helped me at all. It actually would have hurt because it\u2019s discouraging, because it deprives kids of being in control of their destinies. That classification of individuals is very problematic.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\nObviously, the physical safety of children is the number one priority of the Board of Education. So in that sense, you know, it\u2019s my number one priority. There\u2019s a lot that is already being done. There are cameras all over the schools and there\u2019s a command center so if ever there is an event, all the cameras come on and there\u2019s immediate communication with the police. No doors are left unlocked. This is one of the first things I would educate myself on, but at the moment, I would say that I feel confident that a good job is being done. The biggest thing is to make sure that we don\u2019t do what other school districts have done and remove Student Resource Officers from campus.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nThe statement that equity ideologists make is children need to see their ethnicity, their groups, represented and presented. They need to see X number of African Americans or X number of Latinos mentioned. The problem is that\u2019s not what history is about. History is about the events that shaped our culture, that shaped our legal system. So you\u2019re primarily going to be talking Western Europeans for a good part of American History. So what equity ideology does is it basically ignores one of the fundamental reasons of why history is taught. And it tries to replace it with what they believe is psychologically helpful \u2013 but it\u2019s not helpful at all. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s tons of parents, even non-white parents, showing up to school boards saying you can\u2019t teach this stuff to my child.\u00a0\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\nYes, it\u2019s age old and and and is expected to be done. In this county, there are books that parents want to be removed. I believe there\u2019s a list that various parents have put together of like 40 books. I don\u2019t have a view on those books, per se. but we should initiate the process to review the books. What the complaints from the parents revolve around is two items. One is that there are books in the libraries that are blatantly pornographic. There\u2019s even a couple of books that have pictures as X rated as you can get. And the other thing is some of the books portray pedophilia in a sympathetic light. If how the parents present them is shown to be true, then yes, they should be removed. There\u2019s plenty of phenomenal books that can replace any number of books that may need to be removed.",

    "content": "Campaign email: jonathan@votejonathanbriggs.com\nAge: 34\nEmployment: Policy manager, America Forward.\nEducation: Master of Science in Education, Johns Hopkins School of Education\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nI am running for the school board because I believe that every child deserves access to a fair, equal and transformative education experience. What I learned while in the classroom was that if we want to see real change in our education system, then it will take dedicated leaders with the knowledge and \u201cknow-how\u201d working as strong champions for change. I believe our education system is broken in many ways, and I would like to bring my unique experience \u2013 both as a classroom teacher in some of our nation\u2019s toughest schools, and as a policy professional \u2013\u00a0 to represent members of my community, including parents, teachers, students and schools.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nAs a former teacher and near-peer mentor, I have committed my life\u2019s work to becoming a strong champion and advocate for education equity, including being integral in spearheading Illinois\u2019 first ever Children\u2019s Advisory Council, crafting equitable legislation that addresses the opportunity gap that persists in public education (while working for a member of Congress), and developing sound recommendations for the DC Mayor Education to improve its Safe Passage Program. I believe these experiences will support me in representing students, parents and teachers, and in being a sounding board for change.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nI most admire the great (former South African president) Nelson Mandela. I believe his strength of character, and his ability to persist despite insurmountable odds, is truly inspiring. It was clear that in many ways the odds were stacked against Mr. Mandela; he was even a political pariah at one point \u2013\u00a0 with an over-27-year prison sentence that would cause the toughest of us to quiver in fear. Despite all of that, he took every setback and made it a comeback, and that is the type of leader that I aspire to be. Most importantly, he didn\u2019t do this alone, but with a community that\u00a0 supported him and fought alongside him.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI think the biggest issue facing the school board is addressing the learning gap that persists in Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools. The pandemic has exacerbated an already strained learning environment, and students\u2019 academics have been most impacted. If I were elected to the school board, my first day in office would be taking stock of our budget. There is a surplus of funding that is coming down from the Biden-Harris administration to address learning loss at the state and local level. I would want to ensure that we were addressing students\u2019 learning needs by identifying where the steepest gaps exist and then allocating funding to address those needs in partnership with the CEO.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am very concerned about school safety. The steady uptick of gun violence in schools is alarming, and it is having a significant impact on student mental health. I believe a proactive step to begin to address school safety in the long run is investing in more mental health resources for students, that includes school psychologists, social workers and partnerships with local organizations that provide mental health resources. Additionally, addressing the teacher shortage can ensure that there are reasonable class sizes, which will help teachers develop more engaging relationships with students.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI think history should be inclusive of many different perspectives, which includes the perspectives of marginalized groups. This will support students\u2019 ability to think critically about the implications that historical events have had on different communities and how it impacted them. This also provides students with a richer and fuller understanding of our shared history. I believe students should be exposed to diverse perspectives, authors, and content, and it is schools\u2019 and educators\u2019 responsibility to provide students with a well-rounded education. Ultimately students should be challenged to think critically in the classroom, which will prepare them for the rigor of our future.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI think books that provide students with a better understanding of the world around them, in an academic sense, should be largely available for students to consume. If I were to disagree with any book being in a school library, it would be a book that does not serve to provide students with an academic and well-rounded understanding of the world around them. I am a firm believer that any book that challenges a student\u2019s perspective is a good opportunity for them to ask questions and investigate the subject matter further to become more knowledgeable about it.",

My husband and I owned and operated an animal hospital for 35 years.\nEducation: M.S., Yale University, and D.V.M., Cornell University\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI believe that a solid education in the fundamentals \u2013 reading, writing, and basic math \u2013 is essential to the success of all individuals. Based on my own experiences working with graduates, and on the statistics provided by the Maryland Department of Education, a large percentage of Talbot County graduates are not \u201cproficient.\u201d More must be done in the first few years of school to be sure that all students have the basic tools to succeed. I am also concerned that students are ill-prepared to take a responsible role in our democracy because they are not taught civics, and I would like to see Maryland join the other 15 states that require students to pass the High School Civics Test.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nMy family and I have a passion for education, and we have raised our two children accordingly. I attended public school through high school and then earned two advanced degrees at private universities. I would like to see public schools join together with parents to provide the kind of excellent education in the fundamentals that enabled me to have a successful career and be a life-long learner.

I will dedicate my time and energy to ensuring that all children reach their maximum potential.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nI admire Florida\u2019s Gov. Ron DeSantis for his practical and science-based handling of the COVID pandemic, his courageous stance against political correctness, and his effective governance which promotes the prosperity of his state.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe greatest challenge schools face is how to make up for the huge learning and social deficits that were created by the COVID lockdowns. Data on student achievement during those two years is not available to the public, and one can only guess how far our students have fallen behind. I am hopeful that some of the government funds allocated for COVID can be applied for tutoring and special classes. Students need help in developing good study skills. Every effort must be made to rebuild the connections between groups of students, and between students, teachers, and other mentors. \u201cSchool spirit\u201d has never been more important!\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchools should be havens of nurture and education, and we must do everything we can to protect students, teachers, and staff from outside threats. At this time, not all the schools in our county have school resource officers on duty. Arrangements must be made to extend that security blanket to all schools. The school environment can also be damaged by internal disruption. Students and faculty cannot feel safe or perform well if order is not maintained. Unruly and threatening behavior benefits no one.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI do not know the specifics of the history courses taught in Talbot Schools. In principle, I recognize that history is not just a string of dates and events, and that all texts weave them together to tell the story of our past. When reviewing the curriculum, I would hope to find that facts are presented accurately, interpretations are discussed, and different viewpoints are debated. Only by studying the past can we improve our future and avoid repeating past errors.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool libraries should be stocked with books that are age-appropriate, build on the curriculum, and inspire our children. Books that proselytize a certain religion, morality, political or social agenda do not belong in public schools.",

I am running to return their voice, board transparency and parental inclusion. Education is suffering and we need to return to traditional learning.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am the strongest candidate for Board of Education because I am the parent of two Worcester County Schools graduates. I am very familiar with the unnecessary politics in the education system and have dealt with them over the years. I am not a former educator who can be influenced by teachers unions and school administrators. My constituents are my friends and neighbors.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI personally feel like choosing one particular public leader creates bias. Board of Education seats are nonpartisan, and part of why I am running is to get politics out of the schools. I admire hard working, honest and transparent public servants.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue we face is the failing education system in place. High percentages of students in Worcester County are not proficient in math and reading. When elected I will work to make resolutions\u00a0 to the curriculum and teaching methods to a more traditional style, which have proven successful.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSchool safety is a high priority that with communication and cooperation of local police agencies, school administrators and commissioners can be easily\u00a0 improved. I can not be specific with some of these issues here for fear of exposing some of the vulnerabilities of our schools and classrooms.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nYes, I do have issues with the way history is taught in our districts. History should be taught in its original and unchanged form. We are teaching very little history and in a biased form. Although some of history may be dark,\u00a0 we can learn from it and not make those mistakes again. When history is changed, it is no longer there to learn from.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI absolutely believe books pertaining to sex, sexuality, anti-America and anti-police should be removed from school libraries. Students do not go to publicly funded schools for those types of education. This is for families and students to decide at home and there are public libraries for these types of materials.",

During the lockdowns and mask mandates I also saw how many of them suffered from not being in the classroom. The social isolation and loss of academic learning took its toll. The data now coming out is revealing significant delays for our students in academics, cognition, speech and language, as well as social skills. Student mental health has also been impacted. I jumped into this race, though I am not a politician, because I really care about kids and want to make sure this never happens again. I also believe we need to start having our schools focus on education without politics.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nAs a former school psychologist, I have spent 25 years advocating for students and plan to do that on the school board as well. Our children deserve academic excellence, including graduating with the necessary skills needed so that they can be productive citizens as adults. Supporting programs that focus on students\u2019 strengths and providing them with opportunities to do that, whether it be volunteer opportunities or learning to play a musical instrument or participating in sports etc.,\u00a0 are wonderful ways to address and increase positive mental health and wellness. Finally, I will fight for bringing back common sense policies and transparency to create positive and safe school environments.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI always admired Dr. (Martin Luther) King\u2019s message to judge a person by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. I think he would be saddened today to see that there is a movement that is being pushed in our schools to polarize children instead of unite them.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nThere are several issues that I am passionate about, but I will focus on the most important ones to me, including providing transparency to parents, including curriculums that respect their values, promoting safety policies in our schools that work, and let our teachers teach and our children learn, and making sure there are no more lockdowns and mandates.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nYes, I am a big advocate for school safety. Over the past decade we have seen a culture of lax discipline policies that were politically driven. I will advocate for policies that protect our teachers and students and get students whose behaviors are out of control the proper consequences and supports, such as alternative placements so that they can be helped as well.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe in curriculums that promote unity and not division. We have enough polarization in our society and it is not helpful to push school pedagogy that focuses and creates groups of victimhood. We can still teach history appropriately without focusing on identity politics. Public schools should be transparent about their curricula and teach content that fosters a civil society where everyone can flourish.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes, I believe that the sexualization of our children is inappropriate and robs them of their childhood and innocence and that books that do that have no place in our schools. Protecting our children is key.",

My platform focuses on four pillars: Equity for all students (including mental health services and special education services implementation); Teacher Advocacy & Support; Community & Family Engagement; and Transparent & Open Communication. I intend to be accessible, transparent, and accountable as a public servant should be to its constituents.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg.\u00a0 As only the second woman in history to become a Supreme Court justice, she defied many odds and overcame many obstacles. Most importantly, she was a champion for equality and equal rights for all. For this, I admire her and her work, which left a lasting legacy in our country and the world.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nImpacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including learning loss and mental health needs, are the most important issues facing our school community.\u00a0\nI would like to focus on added supports to ensure that our special education students are receiving the services that they need to succeed. I would also advocate for additional programs including summer enrichment, accelerated learning courses, partnerships with tutoring centers, etc. to help students get back on grade level or beyond.\u00a0\nIn addition, I would like to focus on hiring more mental health professionals, including school counselors, mediators, etc. to address the increased mental health needs of both the students, teachers, and school staff.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nAs a parent, school safety is always in the back of my mind, as I am sure it is for many parents.\u00a0 In order to ensure our schools are safe from threats and individuals that seek to harm our students, we must take a multi-layered approach to include comprehensive screening and reevaluation of teachers, visitors, volunteers, and anyone who enters our school building. We must also foster a culture of ownership with our entire school community to encourage \u201csee something, say something.\u201d\u00a0 Finally, we must continually evaluate and test our safety mechanisms working closely with our Director of School Safety to ensure that the processes in place continue to be effective.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nStudents are in school to become educated.\u00a0 My only concern is that history is taught as accurately as possible at an age-appropriate level, and that the curriculum is culturally competent and responsive and includes the contributions and lessons from all groups of people in our communities.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nIn most cases, I do not feel that there is any reason to remove a book from a school library. There may be topics that are not age-appropriate and in those instances, the librarian does a good job of directing students to the kinds of books that are appropriate for their age and grade. This would have to be addressed on a case by case basis, of course, and something that as a board member, I would have to consult with my colleagues on.",

We are not where we need to be, our students have suffered academic, social, and emotional losses during the pandemic and they need our support and quality instruction with a challenging academic curriculum now.\nOur high school students should all have the opportunity to participate in career and technology education.

My friendship with Cathi Forbes goes back almost 20 years. Throughout this time I have witnessed what an outstanding community activist she has been. She spearheaded Towson Parents United to work toward a new elementary school, was instrumental in obtaining renovations and additions for other schools. She has worked with the Students Support Network, particularly during the pandemic. She collected food, delivered it to the site, and volunteered. Cathi works tirelessly in the community and the state legislature. She is always ready to listen and help.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nWe have several issues, however one is the inability of board members to work together in a civil manner as a group. As a board, school facilities, retaining teachers, and providing a challenging academic curriculum for all students would be top priorities. Building a more efficient school system so that we are making the best use of our funding and our employees is critical also.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am concerned about school safety, I believe we all are. It is too easy for individuals with mental health issues to obtain weapons. There are steps that we can take. Let\u2019s make it clear to teachers, students, and parents that if they have a concern or see something they need to report it immediately. Identify students that we may have concerns about and reach out with assistance. We need to look at laws that would limit access to weapons for individuals that are under twenty-one, especially automatic weapons. Individuals have a right to own a weapon, that is not the issue, the issue is protecting our students and staff.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe that we should teach history as it actually occurred. We need to acknowledge historically what we did right and where we made mistakes. We need to do this for other countries as well. We need to look at the accomplishments of all our citizens as our students need role models and often it is difficult to find them in history books,\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes there may be circumstances when books should not be allowed, however I believe that the school systems do an excellent job of reviewing books and placing them at appropriate grade levels\u00a0 Books that promote hatred of people, cultures, and religions should not be allowed.",

There is room for expansion of more inclusive experiences for Hispanic students who are now more than 36% of the student body, such as the inclusion of the history and culture of Latin America.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not agree with book banning. However, school library catalogs should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they include content that represents the diversity of the students of PGCPS and the commitment to culturally responsive teaching.",

Graduate studies at George Mason University and Naval Post Graduate School.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nOpportunity. That\u2019s the answer I have given throughout my tenure as a board member. Providing every child, regardless of socio/economic background, the opportunity to succeed after graduating from CCPS. I represent all stakeholders in the system (teachers, parents, students, taxpayers) and hold myself accountable to them by maintaining high academic standards and fiscal accountability. I marched, lobbied and testified for the Blueprint for Maryland schools, which is a transformational tool that will provide resources for: full day pre-K, areas of poverty, increased CTE (career and technical education) programs and incentives to hire and retain highly qualified teachers and administrators. I will continue to push these efforts.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a current board member, I have the experience and leadership that is vital, given there will be seven new members. I am passionate about providing opportunity to ALL children having grown up in poverty and understanding the obstacles many families have. I retired after 38 years working for the Navy as an engineer and Branch Head, and my wife is a former educator (CCPS and CSM) and our son is a CCPS graduate. I am involved in numerous community organizations and desire to incorporate these nonprofits to help our school system continue to move in a positive direction.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nSteve Jobs. As an engineer I admire his tenacity and desire to make the world a better place. He left us too soon. Oprah Winfrey. Her work ethic and philanthropic endeavors speak for themselves. She came from a less-than-ideal childhood and captured the American dream.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nLearning loss and social/emotional health due to COVID. As a current board member, I have obligated funding for counselors and psychologists to help students deal with the effects of not interacting with students for over a year which manifests itself in disciplinary issues. Academically, extra resources have been (and I will continue this) provided for programs to get kids back on grade level in reading and math. Parental and community involvement is also necessary and I will continue to implement programs that involve our parents and community organizations in our learning process.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it? \u00a0\nI am always concerned about student and staff safety. We have a \u201csee something, say something\u201d program, which has proven effective in preventing unfavorable events before they occur. In our school system, we have taken many measures to keep our schools safer, including guided vestibule entries for visitors, background checks for all volunteers and employees and the hiring of a director of school safety and security.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nIt needs to be factually accurate. We have expanded offerings and will continue to do so in order to be reflective of the community we represent.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nBooks need to be age-appropriate. As long as they are not illegal or violate COMAR (annotated code of Maryland) then they are choices for students.",

Received my diploma from Thomas Stone High School\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nTo get our public schools back to the basics of having a strong academic curriculum that challenges our youth. We are still severely behind and some real changes need to be made.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI have the time to dedicate to the board. I am always trying to talk and listen to the students as they are who I\u2019m fighting for. They deserve a strong academic education so they have a better opportunity for a successful future. I\u2019m also an advocate for parental rights. I LISTEN and I\u2019m not afraid to speak out on serious issues and will fight for the education these kids are entitled to.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nRight now I admire Glenn Youngkin in Virginia for standing strong to improve his state\u2019s school system in spite of some of the backlash he gets from some other politicians. He\u2019s staying true to what he said he would do. I admire anyone who doesn\u2019t play the political game to get votes and continues to follow through on their word. I think character is very important. (Maryland Gov. Larry) Hogan proved he didn\u2019t have much of that.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI believe the system as a whole is failing our youth. I\u2019m watching kids graduate high school that can barely read. It is unacceptable. I\u2019m seeing parents pulling their kids out of the public system to either home school them or send them to private schools. Politics DO NOT belong in schools. We are lowering the required GPA to 2.25 when that\u2019s the worst thing we can do now. Again, get a strong ACADEMIC base back and begin to challenge these kids. EDUCATE THEM. They deserve better and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll fight to give them.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nVery concerned. I have spoken with MANY kids and they are afraid within their own schools. Kids are bringing in weapons and nothing is done. It is impossible to learn if a kid is constantly\u00a0 in fight or flight mode. We have allowed it to get this far so I would be in favor of metal detectors to help ensure safety. The lack of holding kids responsible for their actions is a huge part of the problem.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nTeach ACCURATE history. Tell them the whole truth. Show them the progress that has been made and stop promoting victimhood. Let us learn from the past and move forward. Kids are STILL being taught how different they are and defined by their skin color. It\u2019s not natural and it needs to stop. But I think the constant attempts to divide them is not by accident.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nAny books that can be deemed as pornographic should have never been put in schools.. Kids aren\u2019t allowed to bring in Bibles yet books pornographic in nature are ok? (A spokesperson for the Charles County Public Schools said the district has no such policy barring students from bringing Bibles to school.) As I have said, they should not be in schools to begin with, especially in the library, accessible to any age student. GET POLITICS OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS!",

Board of Education should not be a politically charged position nor should it be a stepping stone for future political aspirations. It should be about improving the opportunities and outcomes for children of Baltimore County.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nThe largest single issue facing the school system in Baltimore County is student performance, and educational outcomes are below expectations. The core job of the schools is to educate.\u00a0 Before we can fix the issue we have to identify what components are going into these outcomes. Having 60% of third grade students reading at below grade level is unacceptable. With a per student allocation of over $15,000/student annually we need to do better.\u00a0 Between teachers, bus drivers, support staff and overall facility conditions, much can be done. We have to reverse the attitudes. Getting students to buy into their own education and retaining teachers who are engaged are both critical to outcomes.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSchool safety is obviously a major concern. With recent events of weapons in schools and incidents we cannot be blind to issues. One thing that is a major concern is the appropriate use of discipline. Without consistent enforcement of school policies, up to and including removal of problem students, students find no consequence and teachers find no recourse for disruptions of class. Actual consequences for actions must be understood by students and consistently applied by administrators.\u00a0\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nMy focus is on the physical state of the schools. My experiences are not in curriculum development. I would need to evaluate specific instances of \u201cHow history is taught.\u201d I believe history should be taught from a factual and neutral perspective.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nBooks must be age-appropriate. Sexualized materials do not belong in Elementary School Libraries. Parents should be allowed to have a voice in the materials that are used in the classroom.",

Less than 42% are proficient in Math and less than 46% are proficient in English Language Arts (HS less than 59% proficient in ELA). We must fix this. To improve student achievement, we need to refocus our efforts on what should be our core mission: Providing a rigorous, high standards-based academic program of instruction, and hold all parties involved accountable. To fix, an all-hands-on deck approach will be necessary, requiring staff, administrators, and supervisors to spend time in the classroom teaching, as well as tutoring students who are behind. Getting discipline under control will also be a critical piece of the student achievement challenge.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nWe should always be concerned about school safety, and it should remain a top priority. CCPS has done a good job focusing on safety at our schools.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI currently do not have concerns.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nYes, books that contain sexually explicit or age-inappropriate content that kids can access without parental consent. A good test would be if you can\u2019t read excerpts from a book during the public comment slot at a school board meeting, because the language or subject matter is too vulgar or inappropriate, then perhaps that book should not be in the school library for minors to read.",

For far too long, education has been the Achilles of this great county. Two of the biggest detractors for direct investment into our community have been 1) crime and 2) education. Both are directly correlated; an educated population creates a stronger labor force, and sound employment mitigates crime. So, essentially if we focus on building stronger schools we can elevate our whole county. My goal is to use the skills I\u2019ve gleaned from the private and public sector to help elevate the overall school system. As a leader, organizer and a financier I want to implement standards, accountability and key performance indicator to offer a world class education to our community.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI help raise my brother and nephew. One attended a private school and the other attended public. I quickly saw the disparity in education. So, I know firsthand the great things about our school system and its challenges. More importantly, as the executive director for a program at Prince George\u2019s County Council, I developed relationships in PGCPS and with elected officials. Those relationships are critical to advancing the county forward, because we have to operate as one big team with one agenda elevating our county. Lastly, I have the skills and passion. I\u2019ve taken the time to cultivate myself at great institutions of learning, and I have worked in the community for years. I have a heart to serve and a proven track record. Serving is my purpose in life, politics aside.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNelson Mandela. I have an affinity for Africa and the stories of champions of equity and equality. Mandela\u2019s mission was to create equality and equity in South Africa by first abolishing apartheid. I too want to be a champion of equity and equality for our nation and more specifically our school system. Standing on the shoulders of a giant, I too want to pick up that mantle. I believe that every child should have access to a world class education and resources. Those are the keys to social mobility. We must make sure we look at everything with an equity lens and meet families where they are.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board and what would you do about it if elected? (150-word limit)\nSafety. As I knock on doors during the campaign, I hear the same thing. Parents are afraid their kids won\u2019t return the same way they left. Securing our schools and community is the most important issue for me. Safety is the foundation of vulnerability, and without vulnerability learning can\u2019t take place.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSafety. Parents are afraid their kids won\u2019t return the same way they left\u2026.My plan to secure our community/schools: 1) Discussion with community stakeholders about organizing and creating actionable solutions around securing our community. 2) Developing a pipeline of educational professionals that can help the teachers in the classroom. i.e. teachers assistants. 3) Give teachers access to a standardized classroom management course to help deal with post-COVID classroom management. 4) Update the student conduct code and handbook.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nI think that we should focus on giving our students access to all the information available and not try to create a narrative that shies away from the actual abuse or occurrences that have happened in history.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI think that libraries are a microcosm of the world. There are differences of opinion and thought all inside the library. I believe that we should equip our kids with the tools to understand what propaganda is and how narratives can be shape to curate certain perceptions. Critical thinking skills are key to becoming a functional adult. Children need to understand that there may be information out there that can be misleading. I\u2019m more inclined to equip our kids with research and critical thinking skills, so they can go through the process of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not on their own. We wont always be there to help. As the saying goes, teach a person to fish.",

We can teach the children that these people made some mistakes which we can all learn by but they also did a huge amount of good. We also need to be teaching children about other amazing people who helped form our country who came from different cultures.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nAbsolutely, we should not allow pornography in our school library shelves.

No one else on the board or running for the board has the system-level experience and perspective needed for effective transformation.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI have been dedicated to improving outcomes for all students\u2014but especially those who have been traditionally underserved \u2014 my entire career as a teacher, public education advocate, researcher and evaluator, professor, adviser to school boards and superintendents, and\u2014most recently \u2014 school board member. This experience and my perspective makes me uniquely qualified for the Montgomery County Board of Education.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nCongressman Jamie Raskin (D-Takoma Park) is my political hero. He has the intelligence, people skills, and tenacity needed to protect against our current threats to democracy. And here is what he said about my campaign: \u201cScott is doing a great job for us on the Montgomery County Board of Education. We are benefiting from his work with school districts across the country and his significant insight as a professor of educational leadership. We\u2019re lucky to have him where he is using his expertise on behalf of our students and our schools.\u201d\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I teach my graduate students, coherence is the foundation of any effective school district. Coherence is the alignment of strategy, systems, resources and culture to a clear philosophy about how student outcomes will improve. Without coherence, MCPS has struggled to provide high-quality supports to school leaders and to effectively engage community stakeholders.\nTo address this, I have:\n\nEmphasized the need for coherence in improving student outcomes with the board\u00a0 and\u00a0 administration.\nOffered ideas to promote coherence.\u00a0\nAsked questions at the board table to reinforce the move toward greater coherence across the system.\n\nIf elected, this will be the ongoing focus of my work.\u00a0\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nEnsuring the safety of students, families and\u00a0 staff is the top priority for schools, the administration and board. We must also ensure that BIPOC (Black, indigenous and people of color) students are not unfairly disciplined or arrested, which has been the case in MCPS and across the country. Therefore, I support:\n\nMaintaining a close, coordinated relationship with MCPD but removing police offers from having a permanent presence in schools. The key will be to carefully monitor the CEO 2.0 program.\nAdditional (unarmed) security personnel. As a current member of the board, I supported funding for 12 additional positions that can be allocated to schools based on need.\nSignificant budget increases for mental health services.\u00a0\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nIn general, I believe that the teaching of history too frequently fails to address the experience and perspectives of races and cultures other than White males. The board will soon be receiving a draft of an anti-racism audit, which will address this topic, and the board and administration are ready to consider recommendations for changes.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nMy general stance is that books should be included in the library and students should be taught to make decisions about what they read based on their interest, reading ability and values. That said, there is a process by which students, parents or staff can submit concerns about and request removal of a particular book. I think this process is important but needs careful supervision by the board to prevent overuse and abuse.",

My children also went to Tilghman Elementary, which we fought hard to keep open.

He has battled unjust corporations and questioned government corruption, never once wavering in his beliefs.

I think in politics that is a rare quality.\u00a0\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nThe most important issue I see facing me is political polarization. It\u2019s hard to believe that there are political sides in a non-partisan elected role. If we are going to be of true service to our children we will have to put our political egos away and focus on what\u2019s best for the student.\u00a0 We have to understand there will be give and take, and as long as the give or the take is not on just one side, then I think we are accomplishing something and ultimately so will the students.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is very important to me, as I have two children in TCPS. I think they do a great job keeping doors locked and knowing the comings and goings. I think drills are another great tool as well. Making sure everyone knows their roles and can instruct the students calmly and efficiently is key. It is something that will always need to be monitored. Whether it is upgraded equipment or a new manner of drills. I think we are pretty safe and just hope we can keep it at the level we have right now.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe that all of us have learned a lot over the years about our history. Even more in the past 10 years. Some good, some bad. These are public issues that need to be addressed. There comes a time when we have to do what\u2019s right and teach the truth. Not rewriting history but righting history. In a public school, I believe public issues need to be taught or at least addressed in some way. If our public schools are for everyone, a one-sided history seems unfair.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not!\u00a0 There is no reason to remove books that have already been accepted into TCPS.\u00a0 Censorship is not going to keep the students safer or make them smarter. Reading will, and with everything going digital \u2026 if they have a book in their hand, I say leave it.",

I witnessed and learned up close and personally the strengths and weaknesses of our small school system. We still have a way to go, but we are on the right track. However, I\u2019m running to drive the school system to become more effective, efficient, and unified in all its core value areas. Attention to this work will be critical as we move through educational changes and challenges. I aim to make Kent County one of the leading school systems, and we are already on that path.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI bring different lenses to the school board service as an educator,\u00a0 consultant, caregiver\u00a0 and community member. As an educator, I understand the needs of my fellow education professionals. The tools and resources they need to be successful in their craft. As a consultant, I see the need for solid operational structures and strategic planning. Caregiver for siblings and relatives in the KCPS system, I know the struggles and successes they have faced in such a rural school system. Being in the community has helped me understand how to bridge the gap between school and community. I know what it means to listen and discern the needs of the county population and student population.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nSarah Johnson Brown. She was a teacher for 44 years and served on the Kent County School Board for 18 years. She believed in education and meeting the needs of the education professionals and children of the school system. After she served as an educator and public official,\u00a0 she worked as a substitute. She has overcome many odds, not limited to racism, the first time reaching the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1970. She has persevered through life challenges, including domestic violence, the death of a son and granddaughter, and raising her four grandchildren after she parented for 18 years. She continues to serve through all her life changes, putting service above herself. That is why I chose her.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nOne of the major issues is the implementation of \u201cBlueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future.\u201d Several moving parts include salary changes, curriculum implementation and accountability measures. This is will be a heavy lift both for school board and the county commissioners. Advocate for the creation of ongoing implementation advisory teams with students, parents, citizens and teachers. These stakeholders would review the systemwide changes and progress of the Blueprint. Hold monthly town halls to inform all stakeholders on progress. We need to work and meet monthly with the county commissioners, to ensure that we are all on the same page with the understanding implementation of the Blueprint.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nThis year I helped the school board propose a resolution to fund school safety initiatives. I have advocated for making sure safety procedures for drills are posted in the classroom to ensure that all educational professionals and scholars understand the drills. I ensured that employees from our school\u2019s operational department were part of their emergency management teams. All KCPS employees received active shooter training, known as ALICE. KCPS needs more training on social-emotional crises and bullying and harassment identification. These are issues that are becoming more prevalent in the ever-changing educational climate. The training needs to be given to all educational professionals.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nNo, I am not concerned about how history is taught in our school system. KCPS believes in an inquiry-based approach to teaching history. It\u2019s not teaching scholars how and what to think about history but investigating primary and secondary sources and making conclusions. I would love to see our educational professionals and school administration help teach scholars about their local history. How do we connect the history taught in class to the surrounding community? History is an ever-changing concept; history and social studies curriculums must be regularly updated and supplemented to ensure that the knowledge and information are current.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nNo, books don\u2019t need to be removed from school bookshelves and school libraries. It is up to curriculum teams to vet books and literary texts to ensure they are up to date. If a book needs to be removed, it must be by a criterion set with precise removal guidelines. Guidelines must be centered around school system policies and procedures. If a parent feels that a text is inappropriate, give the parent an option for their child to receive an alternative text or independent study.",

Even though she is not a current public leader, I have been inspired by her story and continue to be inspired by her true grit of a candidate.

She ran one of the most successful write-in campaigns for her husband to get on their local Kent County school board, and she continues to be a champion for children\u2019s education.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue facing our school board is not being honest and transparent with what is being taught in our schools. Social Emotional Learning, a damaging health framework and constant political agendas are being pushed. We are not spending enough time on the core, classical subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, science and history, an, unfortunately, it shows. Our school board needs to do what is best for the children of the county, not what is best for the teachers unions.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am extremely concerned with school safety. The tag line \u201cGun Free Zones\u201d does not help our schools. We need to focus on making sure our school safety system is checked on a regular basis and staff and students need to be held accountable when rules are broken in regards to safety measures. We need to make sure children and staff feel safe and secure. If new safety measures are found to be needed, we must work together as a community to make sure those measures are met.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nYes, I am very concerned with the way history is being taught. When looking at the curriculum, our history classes are always being taught through a \u201clens.\u201d Students don\u2019t always need to be taught through the \u201clens\u201d of a minority to understand their struggles. History is exciting because we get to learn from those who came before us that have made us who we are today. Historical events are not always meant to have a happy ending. Much of our U.S. and world history is ugly and gruesome, but if we don\u2019t learn about these events in their entirety, we are doomed to repeat them. We need to stop \u201cdumbing down\u201d our history education. Our students deserve better, because our future deserves better.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nA book removed from a curriculum is not a banned book. A book removed from a school library is not a banned book. A book that is illegal to own, possess or distribute IS a banned book. Most of these books in question are meant for \u201cYoung Adults.\u201d I believe a young adult is someone 18-22 years old, no longer enrolled in high school. There are no \u201cYoung Adults\u201d enrolled at school, only minors. This is a family decision, and if a family deems these books appropriate for their child, then they are able to access them at the public library or bookstore. Protecting our children from sexually explicit books is not bad parenting, it is the opposite.",

She has endured so much of the same strength that is needed to succeed. I can relate to her struggles and want every child to understand that doing your best is necessary in any field of endeavor and strive to be the best in whatever field you choose.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nLack of trust in the system. I would listen, learn, and show compassion whatever the topic is. I would encourage the BOE to address all of the issues brought before them in the next meeting.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSafety is an issue for all facets of today\u2019s society, homes, and elsewhere. We need to talk less and listen more to problems people have; empathy is needed.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nYes, this is a real problem in the United States. History is history no matter where you are and unless we acknowledge this, we are destined to repeat mistakes of our past. All nationalities have contributed to these United States. History should not forget this no matter whether it is good, bad or ugly.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI think the field of library science should be given the respect as any other field. In today\u2019s would of automation and access to the internet, students have access to virtually anything. We need to trust those with the knowledge to establish the reference materials for the library.",

    "content": "Campaign email: dorothyandrewsschoolboard@gmail.com\nWebsite: https://www.dorothyandrews4smcboe.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DorothyAndrewsSchoolBoard/\nAge: 66\nEmployment: None.\nEducation: Associate Degree, St. Charles Community College.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nMy perspective on education comes from being a mother of seven, the grandmother of 11, a paraeducator in a Christian school, and a business owner. During the unwarranted closure of the schools, I home schooled two of my grandchildren, one who had attended private school and the other public school. What I quickly observed was the private schooled child was well advanced compared to the child in public school. There are variables that could explain this inconsistency, including different learning abilities. However, I find it of concern that an academic achievement gap reportedly exists between the public and private schools.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am seriously concerned about the educational welfare of children.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nNone. Public policies endure well past the public leaders\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\nThe most important issue is the achievement of literacy \u2013 grade level reading and writing proficiency \u2013 by the completion of the third grade. If elected, I will focus strongly on traditional education and literacy.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am very concerned. If elected, my policy on school security will be that the school administration must strictly adhere to the requirements of the Maryland Safe to Learn Act and the memorandums of understanding with the sheriff\u2019s office and the state\u2019s attorney regarding school security, especially the initiative pertaining to gangs.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\nMy only concern about the teaching of history is that it adheres to historical facts. Rather than the rote memorization of who, what, when, and where, the focus should be on imparting a factual understanding of \u201cwhy\u201d events occurred.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nAll school library books must be age-appropriate to the subject matter or otherwise removed.",
