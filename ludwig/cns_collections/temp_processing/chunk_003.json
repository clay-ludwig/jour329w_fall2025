    "summary": "Division III football players at Salisbury University often face challenges balancing academics and athletics, with strict academic requirements and less glamorous conditions compared to Division I. Despite these challenges, many players appreciate the focus on education and see it as a more authentic college athlete experience.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 For the third time in four weeks, the Division III football team at Salisbury University was making final preparations for a trip to face an opposing team.\nFriday mornings before a trip to another school are busy affairs for college football teams, but two defensive starters for the Seagulls had an extra item on their checklist: they had to take an exam for one of their classes they would miss that day. \n\u201cTheir instructor said they either take the exam today, or they get a zero,\u201d Salisbury head coach Sherman Wood told Capital News Service. \u201cTheir final (exams) will make up for their worst score. Well, if they missed today, their final would make up for a zero.\u201d \nThis is a common occurrence with Division III football programs, and it\u2019s an example of the stark contrast between how those division\u2019s schools handle student-athletes and how higher-profile Division I schools tackle the balance between the classroom and the playing field. \nAll three division of the NCAA stress high academic standards, but Division III is the only one branded with academics as the primary focus for student-athletes. While the athletic association\u2019s description of Division III highlights putting the student before the athletics, its promotion of Division I includes sponsors, football championships and a \u201cwide range of opportunities for athletics participation.\u201d\nThe pitch from Division III football coaches to high school recruits is simple: they will have the chance to get quality educations while receiving the experience of being a college athlete.\nBut being a football player in Division III does not have the glitz and glamour that comes with playing for a Division I team. The lower division teams take buses to away games instead of flying; professors are more strict when it comes to missing class; and uneven levels of funding for programs create irregular conditions for game preparation.\nMany players enjoy their time in Division III, though, and some believe it is the truest form of the student-athlete.\nCatholic University of America offensive lineman Kevin Zimmerman sets back in a pass block against an opposing defensive end. (Photo courtesy of Joey Gardner/ FotoJoe)\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Division I players are very athletically gifted,\u201d said Catholic University of America sophomore Kevin Zimmerman. \u201cThat\u2019s what got them to the next level. But I know their schedules are very maneuvered to focus on their athletics and not as much on their academics.\u201d\nRecruiting with a wide net and high standards\nDivision III has the largest number of student-athletes playing college sports in the NCAA. According the association\u2019s website, about 39 percent of all student-athletes compete in Division III in 443 active-member schools.\nAs a result, each team is a mixture of players of different backgrounds and talent levels. There are some who are talented enough to land on the fringes of Division II but felt more comfortable playing Division III; others have limited options or are just happy to be on a college roster.\n\u201cWe can have athletes who are high-end, and we can have some who really need a lot of work before they\u2019re ready to step on the field,\u201d said CUA head coach Michael Gutelius. \u201cBut because we\u2019re not worried about a roster cap, we can\u2026take a lot of guys.\u201d\nBut institutional requirements carry more weight when evaluating players. Coaches at Salisbury look at a student-athlete\u2019s high school grade transcripts almost immediately after determining they might be a fit for their program.\n\u201cIt has to be at least within our range,\u201d Wood said of the transcripts. \nIf a student\u2019s transcript fits the university\u2019s qualifications, Wood and his staff evaluate the player\u2019s character, talent and work ethic. \nBut schools don\u2019t always have a large recruiting budget, meaning coaching staffs have to find alternative ways to save money, like staying with family on out-of-state recruiting trips.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of for us to say\u2026\u2019Okay, you got family in Northern New Jersey, so you cover Southern New Jersey and Southern New York,\u201d Gutelius said.\nDivision III coaches search for the best available athletes like higher divisions, but those athletes can come from other sports. Salisbury senior defensive lineman Isaac Johnson spent most of his time playing basketball at Parkside High School in Washington and didn\u2019t consider switching to football until his senior year.\n\u201cIn Division III recruiting, you cast a wider net to see who fits,\u201d Gutelius said. \u201cAnd you have to\u2026whittle it down to a tighter group.\u201d\nStudent first, athlete second\nProfessors at Division III colleges don\u2019t usually make exceptions for student-athletes when it comes to attendance, and when they do, it has to come with a written excuse.\n\u201cIt\u2019s academics,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWe have to work around them. And we don\u2019t complain. That\u2019s why (the athletes) are here.\u201d\nWood had to stay after practice and a team meeting on Thursday to write excuses to 12 of his players\u2019 instructors for them to miss class on Friday.\n\u201cI get replies from instructors saying they received the letters and the kids are excused, so you get a few who are OK with it,\u201d Wood said.\nBut Wood added there are some professors who want to make sure important grades like exams are taken the day they are scheduled. For his players who had to take an exam before they left for Southern Virginia, their instructor allowed them to take the exam with her 9 a.m. class to make up for missing class that day.\nDivision III athletes have limited control when it comes to picking their classes; they have the ability to register like other students, but they have few options on choosing which semester the class falls in. \nSo, if a more difficult course is only offered during football season, they have to take it.\n\u201cI think the academics in general make the Division III experience a little tougher, especially during the season,\u201d CUA sophomore quarterback Brady Berger said. \u201cI have to go listen to lectures, go to classes to prepare me for internships. And you have to make sure you go to the athletic center for a two-hour practice, film study and weight-lifting.\u201d\nCatholic University of America quarterback Brady Berger is poised to make a pass as he looks downfield during a game. (Photo courtesy of CUA Athletics)\nAlthough they do have access to tutors to help them in class, passing the class is completely on the players.\n\u201cAs far as getting the grades, you have to be a man, get them yourself,\u201d Johnson said.\nZimmerman said he is currently enrolled in a class that has regular quizzes on Fridays, so he\u2019s had to miss \u201ca handful\u201d of them over the course of the season. Those quizzes don\u2019t account for a large total of his grade, but Zimmerman said that his teammates advise taking any easy class that can balance out the workload in the fall semester.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to play football\u2026you need to take classes you can afford to miss,\u201d he said. \nBus rides and wedding tents\nThere are Division III schools that have well-funded facilities. Salisbury\u2019s Seagull Stadium cost $21 million and CUA recently opened a new weight room.\nBut there are some schools that don\u2019t have new facilities like locker rooms for visiting teams. Johnson recalled a situation in his sophomore season when the team had to dress in a wedding tent and had to walk to a high school to take a shower after the game.\nNow in his senior year at Salisbury, Johnson said he got used to those conditions eventually.\n\u201cAfter the first year or so it doesn\u2019t really bother you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tend to like it.\u201d\nSalisbury University offensive lineman Isaac Johnson (38) makes a move against an opposing lineman and closes in for a sack. (Photo courtesy of Joey Gardner/ FotoJoe)\nMost Division III schools don\u2019t have the budget to allow teams to fly to every game, which means they take buses.\nMany schools play in a localized conference, meaning they rarely have to travel long distances. As a member of the Capital Athletic Conference, Salisbury plays teams in Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nBut sometimes schools have to make longer treks for games. For example, CUA traveled 15 hours to play a game against Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine, in 2017.\n\u201cWe started driving that Thursday, made it halfway, then drove the rest of the way on Friday,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThen we drove the whole 15 hours back after the game. I think we got back around 5:30 the following morning.\u201d CUA won the season finale 33-14.\nThe trick to making such a long ride depends on getting as comfortable as possible, Zimmerman said, but he added that it doesn\u2019t have too much of an impact on performance.\nThe other aspects of Division III football that aren\u2019t as flashy as Division I don\u2019t seem to bother the players, either. They may not get as much national television exposure or looks from NFL scouts, but most of them are just happy to play the sport they love and thankful for the coaches who gave them a chance.\n\u201cI still love this program even though we don\u2019t have all the things they get in Division I,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt teaches me what the true sport of football is. I never thought I would be who I am today.\u201d",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan believes University of Maryland head coach DJ Durkin, athletic director Damon Evans and president Wallace Loh will be fired for mishandling an abusive culture that resulted in Jordan McNair\u2019s death by heatstroke.\n Brennan said she feels the removal of the three individuals seems likely based on her experience covering similar incidents. She was part of a panel Wednesday organized by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland\u2019s Philip Merrill College of Journalism that discussed media coverage in the aftermath of the McNair tragedy.\n\u201cI just think this is so bad,\u201d Brennan said of the situation. \u201cI think Maryland is better than this.\u201d\nThe communications office for Loh had no comment on Brennan\u2019s remarks. The Maryland athletics department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMcNair\u2019s death and the coverage surrounding it has resulted in a dissection of the culture of Maryland\u2019s football program. The aftermath included the resignation of strength coach Rick Court; the placement of Durkin and two athletic trainers on administrative leave; and two investigations, one of which is ongoing.\nMcNair, a sophomore football player, was hospitalized on May 29 after collapsing during a summer practice and died June 13. More than a month later, it was confirmed by multiple reports that McNair died of heatstroke.\nJames Crabtree-Hannigan, sports editor of Maryland\u2019s campus newspaper, The Diamondback, told the panel the university\u2019s missteps in caring for McNair had been clear since late July.\n\u201cThe fact is if someone dies of heatstroke, they weren\u2019t properly treated,\u201d Crabtree-Hannigan said.\nResults of an independent investigation presented to the University System of Maryland Board of Regents showed that McNair did not receive proper care after collapsing on the field. The university medical staff wrapped McNair in cold towels instead of giving him cold water immersion therapy, which is a common treatment for heatstroke.\nIt took 34 minutes before McNair was removed from the field and was placed in an ambulance 1 hour and 39 minutes after he began to suffer seizures. \nOn Aug. 10, ESPN released article by Heather Dinich detailing what she called a toxic culture under Durkin and spearheaded by Court. The report described a culture based on \u201cfear and intimidation\u201d with verbal abuse and the endorsement of bad eating habits. \nDurkin was placed on administrative leave the following day. Two days later, Court announced his resignation.\nBrennan said the ESPN report hit \u201clike a ton of bricks.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the nation said, \u2018woah, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen it became a national story. You know when you get calls from CNN Headline News that this has left sports and gone into the culture in a big way.\u201d\nWhen Dave Ziren, sports editor for The Nation and also on the Povich panel, first heard of McNair\u2019s death, he said he speculated whether there were any signs of a toxic culture that could have prevented the tragedy.\n\u201cI wondered if there had been letters sent, emails sent to say\u2026there is something with the culture of the way practices are happening here,\u201d he said. \u201cI wondered if there would be that tragic correlation.\u201d\nBut according to Crabtree-Hannigan, the signs were there. He recalled Durkin bragging during press conferences that practices were held when it was hot because the head coach wanted his players to be prepared to play in the heat.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking that way and using cavalier language (the coaching staff) was using about changing the culture\u2026it\u2019s rather damaging,\u201d Crabtree-Hannigan said. \nAnd according to a Sept. 30 Washington Post story, there was also an unsigned letter hand-delivered to Loh in December of 2016 that was written to warn the university president of a \u201ccalamitous and abusive behavior in the football program.\u201d\nLoh denied hearing of any abuse at Maryland before the ESPN report was released.\nLoh also denied a proposal one year before McNair\u2019s death that would have altered the medical care for athletes at the university, according to an article published by The Washington Post in August. The plan would require athletic trainers to attend the university\u2019s school of medicine in Baltimore and to be independent from the athletic department.\nBecause of the negligence from the university and abuse from the football program, Brennan believes there will a complete change of leadership at the university.\n\u201cMy sense is that they will all be gone,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cJust from covering a lot of these things over the years and not being born yesterday, this is what this looks like.\u201d",

Larry Hogan signed an executive order Tuesday forming an Office of Education Accountability, an independently appointed investigator general, to look into allegations of corruption, abuse and other improprieties in the public education systems across the state.\nThe governor\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of several high-profile scandals in Maryland school systems.\nIn Prince George\u2019s County, school board members last year accused county school system leadership of artificially inflating graduation rates by altering students\u2019 grades, and in March cited unapproved pay raises for some school system staff.\nHogan highlighted former Baltimore County Schools Superintendent Dallas Dance\u2019s recent jail sentence after he pleaded guilty in March to perjury as an example of the need for more oversight. Dance failed to disclose income he received from a company that he helped to obtain a no-bid contract with the school system.\n\u201cAfter repeated allegations of wrongdoing, mismanagement and corruption, citizens have lost confidence in the leadership of their local school systems,\u201d Hogan said at a State House news conference. \u201cOur children cannot and should not have to wait until the Legislature returns in January,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThey deserve action beginning right now.\u201d\nThe newly formed office \u201cwill act as a liaison between local boards of education, the state Board of Education and Maryland\u2019s concerned citizens,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThis new unit will be responsible for analyzing, coordinating and providing recommendations on matters including procurement improprieties, abuse, neglect, safety, grade fixing, graduation requirements, assessments, educational facilities and budgetary issues.\u201d\nA bill Hogan, a Republican running for re-election, spearheaded earlier this year to establish an investigative oversight office for schools failed in the Democrat-controlled Legislature.\nThe governor\u2019s executive order will be followed by the introduction of the Accountability in Education Act of 2019 to the General Assembly after the legislative session begins Jan. 9, Hogan said. The act would establish the Office of State Education Investigator General, an independent part of the Maryland State Department of Education, and would be appointed by Hogan, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., D-Prince George\u2019s, Charles and Calvert and House Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel.\n\u201cThis new office will be charged with investigating complaints of unethical, unprofessional, improper or illegal conduct in our schools,\u201d Hogan said, and \u201cwill be able to make inquiries, have the ability to obtain information by subpoena and hold hearings in order to get to the truth.\u201d\nJohn Woolums, the director of governmental relations for the Maryland Association of Boards of Education, said his office has previously opposed similar legislation to create a statewide inspector general, and their position would not change with the governor\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not reflective of any reluctance to be subject to accountability but in fact it\u2019s because there is ample authority residing with the state\u2019s superintendent of schools and the state Board of Education to provide oversight and enforce state laws and regulations that they determine are not being followed or adhered to by local school systems,\u201d Woolums said. \u201cThere have been bills in the past introduced to create an inspector general and we\u2019ve traditionally and consistently opposed those.\u201d\nHogan appointed Valerie Radomsky to be the director of the newly formed office. Radomsky, a former Baltimore County school teacher, is a Board of Public Works coordinator in the Maryland comptroller\u2019s office.\nThe new office would be responsible for responding to complaints and referring them to the State Board of Education or other public school agencies. The complaints, and their resolutions, would be maintained in a database, Hogan said. An annual report of the findings and recommendations would be submitted to the General Assembly, he added.\nHogan\u2019s gubernatorial opponent, Democratic candidate Ben Jealous, criticized Hogan\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cA political investigator run out of the governor\u2019s office won\u2019t change the fact that our schools are underfunded by billions of dollars and our teachers are underpaid. As governor, I will fully fund our schools, not blame our hardworking teachers and support staff.\u201d\nHogan maintains he has spent record amounts of money on education in Maryland, in excess of the Legislature\u2019s mandated funding formulas.\nJealous announced a piece of his own education agenda Tuesday, promising the creation of a Teacher School Supply Fund. The money would come from other Marylanders choosing to donate a portion of their tax returns.\nMaryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost voiced her disappointment at Hogan\u2019s decision to sign the executive order.\n\u201cOn what should be an exciting first day (of school), to hear Gov. Hogan highlight failures when he, for the past three years has underfunded our schools\u2026\u201d Bost said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s office already has agencies available to look into claims of fraud. This is a diversion of resources, and campaign rhetoric.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 A bill that aims to ensure young, undocumented Maryland students referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d can pursue higher education by giving qualified individuals access to in-state tuition is advancing in the Maryland General Assembly.\nThe circumstances under which Dreamers and residents with temporary protective status are exempt from paying the out-of-state tuition rate at public institutions of higher education will be altered under House bill 1536, which is cross-filed as Senate bill 546.\nUnder the legislation, qualified students would soon be able to pay the in-state tuition rate at any Maryland public higher education institution or the in-county rate at any community college, regardless of whether they live in that county.\nThe current state Dream Act, passed in 2012, says that an individual who attended a Maryland high school for at least three years and graduated or received the equivalent of a high school diploma pays the same tuition rates that resident students pay. \nCurrent law also states that students are required to begin at a Maryland community college in the same district as the high school they graduated from. Once the student completes 60 credits, they may enroll at a public four-year institution and pay in-state tuition. \nThe new bill removes the credit requirement and would allow students to directly enter any public state college or university, and extends the period of eligibility from four to six years after graduating from high school. It would go into effect on July 1.\n\u201cCountless students who qualify (for in-state tuition) are more than ready to begin higher education at a four-year university right away. This bill will allow these Dreamers to continue their academic career at the college of their choice,\u201d said sponsor Delegate Sheila Hixson, D-Montgomery, in a statement to Capital News Service. \nHigh school senior and advocate for CASA, an immigrants-rights advocacy group, Jesus Vicu\u00f1a, 18, one of the 9,700 Dreamers under protective status in the state, worries that his time will run out before he is able to pursue his dream of running track at Coppin State University, which just sent him an acceptance letter.\n\u201cI started to feel a sense of stability, I no longer had to live in the shadows. \u2026 For the first time I started to picture myself at a university and I finally had the opportunity to make my parents\u2019 sacrifices worth it,\u201d said Vicu\u00f1a, who lives in Baltimore and attends Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, a public high school, about receiving DACA at the age of 15 after immigrating from Mexico with his family at 9 months old. \nHis DACA waiver runs out in April 2019, he said. \nVicu\u00f1a got involved in CASA and his high school\u2019s Hispanic club to promote legislation that helps students like him and testified in front of the Maryland House Ways and Means committee in favor of House bill 1536. \n\u201cThis is a big step towards progress because everything is so unsure at the federal level,\u201d he said. \nThe Trump administration announced Sep. 5 it was phasing out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and gave Congress six months to figure out a solution. It was further delayed by rulings from federal judges in California and New York, who both ordered the Trump administration to resume processing DACA renewal applications.\nWhile the deadline has passed without a fix from Congress, the case is still going through the federal appeals process, leaving DACA recipients in limbo. \nA recent Supreme Court ruling has given DACA participants a reprieve. \nThe University System of Maryland is monitoring this legislation and will continue to welcome qualified students as they have since the Dream Act was enacted, according to a representative for the University System.",

Physical education teachers Matt Slatkin and Shannon Spencer support the bill, arguing that current practices in some counties, like counting recess as part of physical education time, do not ensure adequate student movement.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 The majority of jurisdictions in the state set aside fewer than 90 minutes per week for physical education.\nBut for the past eight years, legislation introduced to require a higher physical activity and education standard in the state has still not seen progress. \nThe sponsor of the legislation, Delegate Jay Walker D-Prince George\u2019s, called it \u201ca bill that we\u2019ve seen too many times over the years.\u201d\nThe proposal requires all public elementary schools to set aside a maximum of 150 minutes per week for physical activity, including a minimum of 90 minutes per week for physical education.\nFor required minutes not spent in physical education, elementary schools would have to designate a physical activity leadership team to plan and coordinate extra opportunities for activity, the bill states.\nThe biggest issue remains what the school districts would cut from their academic curriculums to provide more time for physical activity. \nWalker said he \u201ctalked to people that work with Boards of Education in the state (who) said if it\u2019s mandated they would find a way to make it work.\u201d \nDuring the bill\u2019s hearing on Feb. 8, Delegate Carolyn Howard D-Prince George\u2019s, asked how to incorporate more physical education.\n\u201cThe question has always been, what do you remove or delete in teaching in schools so that we can get the 90 minutes?\u201d asked Howard.\nNewport Mill Middle School physical education teachers Matt Slatkin and Shannon Spencer have supported this legislation \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d because, they told Capital News Service, lack of elementary school physical education affects students when they attend middle school. \nSlatkin told the Capital News Service that Montgomery County Public Schools, where Newport Mill is located, \u201cskirt\u201d around the term physical activity by counting physical education with recess. \nWhile the county includes the 30 minutes a day for physical activity during recess, students may not even move at all, Slatkin said. He added that recess is often held indoors during the winter and in times of bad weather. \nSlatkin said physical education is taught by a professional teacher, whereas recess does not require a curriculum or standards, and does not teach anything. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t try to compare recess to physical education,\u201d said Slatkin. \nAccording to the Maryland State Department of Education, as of January 2018, Montgomery County has the lowest minimum amount of required physical education per week at 30 minutes, followed by Prince George\u2019s with 40 minutes per week. \nAccording to a state analysis, 18 of the state\u2019s 24 jurisdictions do not meet the 90-minute standard under the bill; at least four of those would need to hire additional staff \u2014 at a total cost of $13.7 million \u2014 to meet that requirement if the legislation passes. \nThis includes $1.1 million for Allegany, $1.2 million for Cecil, $10.9 million for Montgomery, and $542,000 for Queen Anne\u2019s; these amounts are expected to increase marginally over the following few years, according to the state analysis. Allegany would need 14 teachers, Cecil would need 17, Montgomery would need 133 and Queen Anne\u2019s would need eight to meet the bill requirements, according to the fiscal analysis.\nThe other 14 jurisdictions that don\u2019t require at least 90 minutes may also need an increase in funds to meet the standard, but they have not been assessed in the fiscal analysis.\nThe remaining 10 jurisdictions would not need additional funding because they already meet the proposed standards.\nThe bill would take effect on Oct. 1, but a local school system may apply for an extension until July 1, 2021 to ensure compliance. \nThe federal No Child Left Behind Act in 2002 altered allotted time for certain school activities, according to the state fiscal analysis.\nFollowing the No Child Left Behind Act, a national study on curriculum by the Center on Education Policy found that schools prioritized time on tested subjects, including math and language arts, and spent less time on other subjects and activities, including lunch, physical education and recess. \nWalker said during committee testimony on Feb. 8 that the bill\u2019s cost has decreased over the years and that \u201cit is possible to implement this program.\u201d\nPatricia Swanson, legislative aide for Montgomery County Public Schools Board of Education, told Capital News Service the board opposed this legislation because it is a large unfunded mandate and does not believe this issue should be decided at a state level. \nSwanson also said \u201cMCPS has taken action to clarify physical education time with schools beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, and is taking steps to gather information directly from each school on current schedules and class time.\u201d\nIn the 2018 to 2019 school year grades K-5 will be required a minimum of 45 minutes of physical education per week, she said.\nChildren between 5 and 12 years old should get at least an hour per day of physical activity, according to The National Association for Sport and Physical Education. The activity should be intermittent and a mix of moderate and vigorous exercise, the association said.\nWhile the bill is not expected to progress in the legislative session, Slatkin told the Capital News Service that he believes that as the public\u2019s knowledge grows, so will support for the bill. \n\u201cNobody knew about this bill the past eight years and now it\u2019s finally getting out,\u201d said Slatkin. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the parents want, the students want, and the teachers want.\u201d",

These actions follow audits and indictments that revealed significant issues in school systems, including unqualified graduates and undisclosed earnings from private firms by educators.",
    "content": "THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED*\nANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Prompted by alleged grade-fixing in Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools and perjury and theft allegations in the Baltimore area, a pair of bills in the General Assembly would establish investigative offices to oversee schools in Maryland. \nRepublican Gov. Larry Hogan and a Democratic lawmaker each are attempting to get their own education accountability bills passed this year. \nThe bills come after state Department of Education officials hired a Washington-based firm, Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services, to audit graduation rates in the Prince George\u2019s County public school system, following a letter that several school board members wrote to Hogan citing \u201cwidespread systemic corruption.\u201d\nThe audit used sample groups taken from the 2016 and 2017 graduating classes and found that, on average, nearly 5 percent of the students had been ineligible to graduate. An additional 24.5 percent, on average, were lacking documentation to verify that they were qualified to graduate. \nBecause it was based on a sample, the audit report did not identify system-wide fraud in the Prince George\u2019s County school system. \nBaltimore County Superintendent Dallas Dance was indicted earlier this year on four counts of perjury following an investigation that concluded he failed to disclose almost $147,000 from private consulting firms. His successor, Verletta White, was also reported to have failed to disclose money earned from private firms. \nFormer Baltimore Community High School principal Leslie Lewis pleaded guilty to stealing more than $58,000 from the school. \nHogan\u2019s response was the introduction of the Accountability in Education Act of 2018 (Senate bill 302 and House bill 355) to create an independent unit, the Office of the State Education Investigator General, within the Maryland State Department of Education. \n\u201cThis lack of accountability in education systems all across our state cannot and will not be tolerated by our administration,\u201d said Hogan in a statement. \u201cNot addressing it would mean that we are failing Maryland taxpayers, and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 failing our children who need help the most.\u201d\nUnder Hogan\u2019s plan, the Investigator General, as a part of an Education Monitoring Unit, would be charged with investigating complaints of unethical conduct in Maryland public schools. \nA representative of the state teachers\u2019 union said he is concerned that the majority of the members \u2014 five \u2014 are appointed by the governor with the other four \u2014 two each \u2014 by the Senate president and speaker of the House. This group then evaluates candidates and makes a recommendation to the governor for a new Investigator General.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think the answer is to politicize the schools,\u201d said Steven Hershkowitz, press secretary for the Maryland State Education Association. \nAnother bill, sponsored by Delegate Alonzo T. Washington, D-Prince George\u2019s, puts power in local hands by authorizing county commissioners or the city or county to establish an Office of the Investigator General in a local school system. These local offices would be able to conduct their own investigations without the need for state involvement under this legislation, House bill 1492. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary to have a statewide inspector,\u201d Washington told Capital News Service Tuesday. \u201cOur local jurisdictions can handle this issue.\u201d \nThrough a third bill, House bill 184, Washington is also working to establish an Inspector General solely in Prince George\u2019s County. \n*Story has been udpated with the following changes: In a paragraph quoting a Maryland State Education Association spokesman, the quote has been shortened. The preceding two paragraphs are new and include clarifying information. The two paragraphs preceding those have been moved.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Legislation that would expand funding for pre-kindergarten and special education and encourage students to become teachers topped the list of priorities a state panel announced on Thursday.\nThe legislation, House bill 1415 and Senate bill 1092, also would create an early-literacy initiative and other resources for students living in poverty, and promote career and technical education. \nFormed in 2016 by the General Assembly, the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education is often referred to as the \u201cKirwin Commission\u201d after its chair, William English \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, former president of the University of Maryland and chancellor of the University System of Maryland.\nThe commission brings together representatives from across the state to review the findings from past educational aid formulas and hear from national experts on world class school systems to address education policy issues Maryland is facing. \nAlong with the new bills, the commission has proposed: creating a way for teachers to earn more; providing free or low-cost pre-kindergarten to every 4-year-old in the state; giving more resources to at-risk students; and reinstating vocational training in many high schools, according to the preliminary report it released Thursday.\nThe goal is to prepare Maryland students \u201cto meet the challenges of a changing global economy, to meet the State\u2019s workforce needs, to be prepared for postsecondary education\u00a0and the workforce, and to be successful citizens in the 21st century.\u201d \nDelegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore, told Capital News Service the recommendations would be \u201ca great first tiny step\u201d toward looking at areas in need of reform.\nThe recommendations would be implemented in small grants\u2014likely over the span of 10 years or so\u2014and allow students to be tracked so the benefits can be assessed later, said McIntosh, who sits on the commission. \nThe Kirwan Commission, tasked with focusing on education funding, was told by a consultant that state and local governments need to increase education funding by about $3 billion, in addition to the approximately $6.5 billion the state spends now. \n\u201cThe budget this year is going to meet the requirements for an outdated funding formula, created in the early 2000s, which never anticipated students coming from poverty or speaking English as a second language,\u201d Steven Hershkowitz, press secretary for the Maryland State Education Association said last week.\n\u201cAs enrollment climbs our schools don\u2019t have the resources they need to stay on top,\u201d Hershkowitz said. \u201cThere was $2.9 billion found to be underfunded (by the commission), the schools need it desperately.\u201d \nGov. Larry Hogan, R, recently criticized the commission for the time it took to put together the report, saying that he might need to \u201csend out a search party.\u201d \nDelegate Adrienne A. Jones responded to the comments during a press conference Thursday saying she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Hogan\u2019s words. \nThis year\u2019s package of legislation is a \u201cprecursor of a bill coming next year,\u201d according to Kirwan; a final report of the commission\u2019s findings is scheduled to be issued later this year.\n\u2013CNS Correspondent Sean Whooley contributed to this report.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 A significant spike in juvenile crime from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. on school days has led to a push by the state\u2019s juvenile justice agency to shift school start and finish times.\nThe department is advocating for a later opening and release to limit the amount of time kids spend unsupervised in the evening. The thinking goes, the more time teenagers are congregated in one spot, the greater chance of delinquency.\n\u201cIf you think about it, especially in environments that are urban, you usually have a large number of teenagers getting released from school at the same time,\u201d said Jay Cleary, chief of staff to Sam Abed, the secretary of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. \u201cEverybody is in one place, at one time. It just tends to be sort of a natural result.\u201d\nThe proposal got some positive responses among members of a House committee last month.\nDelegate Curt Anderson, D-Baltimore, told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service that he is enthusiastic about the start-time idea. He said he had previously supported longer days on an academic basis, though the department\u2019s proposal is to simply shift hours, ideally 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., not to extend the day.\n\u201cIf (later or longer hours is) also talked about in relationship to public safety, I think that gives it another push,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cMr. Abed talking about it in terms of the juvenile system, I think, was very timely.\u201d Abed presented his findings to the House Judiciary Committee on Jan 17.\nAccording to 2014 data from the U.S. Justice Department, roughly 19 percent of juvenile violent crime \u2013 which includes murder, sexual assault, simple assault, robbery and aggravated assault \u2013 happens during the hours of 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.\nFifteen percent occurs during the standard juvenile curfew hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. But because \u201ccurfew\u201d times are 8 hours long, every day of the year, the rate of crime during the four after-school hours is much higher, the report found.\nAnd even though the number of school days and non-school days in a year are essentially the same, 63 percent of violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days, the Justice Department reported.\nIn Baltimore City, the vast majority of middle and high schools release at 3:30 p.m. or later. City Neighbors High lets out the latest, at 4 p.m. and starts at 9 a.m.\nAmy Krulak, a special educator at City Neighbors High School, said the later hours have benefited students from an academic standpoint \u2013 they are more alert at 9 a.m. \u2013 but isn\u2019t convinced that a later release would affect public safety.\nIt\u2019s a nice idea, she said, but students would still, at some point, be together at a bus stop.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re getting out (together) at the same time, just later, I don\u2019t know if that solves anything,\u201d Krulak said.\nKrulak also said it wouldn\u2019t be ideal for students to walk home in the dark. The key to improving conduct in her view is for the school to \u201ccreate a healthy environment\u201d during regular hours.\nThe department of Juvenile Justice Services doesn\u2019t see a downside.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to completely eliminate young people getting into trouble at those times,\u201d Cleary said. \u201cBut the spike is fairly large as it is right now (at the) 3 or 4 o\u2019clock timeframe. If you\u2019re able to push that out a little further, it can only help.\u201d\nThe Baltimore City School Board said in an email to Capital News Service in January that it doesn\u2019t have any thoughts or ideas regarding the secretary\u2019s recommendation.\nThe bulk of Abed\u2019s presentation was aimed to show the department\u2019s progress in providing services and refining its methods, from addressing racial inequity to connecting released youth to community service.\nDelegate David Moon, D-Montgomery, said he came away from the briefing particularly interested in the school-start time idea.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIf you believe the data (from Secretary Abed\u2019s presentation), basically this is an issue about after-school supervision, to the extent that kids are getting out at 3 o\u2019clock and then committing violent crimes until dinner time.\u201d\nMoon noted, however, that it\u2019s precisely these types of specifics that show that more information is necessary in all facets of juvenile services to form legislation and pass effective solutions.\n\u201cThe more data you have \u2013 and you can tease out little items like that \u2013 it might give you pause, to say \u2018Okay, maybe the solution isn\u2019t so simple as let\u2019s add 10 years to someone\u2019s jail sentence,\u2019\u201d Moon said. \u201cIf there are other factors in play, I\u2019d like to see us take a more evidence-based approach.\u201d\n\u201330\u2013",

    "summary": "Maryland legislators are proposing a bill to expand tuition grants for former foster youth, allowing those who were at least 13 years old and later adopted or reunited with parents to receive free in-state college tuition. The bill aims to remove barriers to adoption and higher education by extending the eligibility period from 5 to 10 years.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS,Maryland \u2014 Verging on adulthood, Shalita O\u2019Neale faced a big decision: college or family?\n\u201cI had a family member who wanted to adopt me but they felt it would be best if I stayed in the foster care system because of the gift of post-secondary education,\u201d O\u2019Neale told a panel of Maryland lawmakers last week. \n\u201cThis was a barrier for adoption for me\u2026I did stay in foster care and I aged out at age 21,\u201dsaid O\u2019Neale, foster youth ombudsman for the Department of Human Services. \nMaryland legislators want to make that decision easier with a proposed expansion of tuition grants to help more teens who have gone through the foster care system get a higher education.\nThis bill would extend free in-state tuition for public institutions to students who were 13 or older in foster care for at least a year, but later reunited with their parents or adopted.\nSenate bill 85, requested by the Department of Human Services and approved by the Maryland Senate on Tuesday, also extended the time frame for foster youth to obtain their degrees from 5 to 10 years. \nThe bill is expected to go through the House of Delegates, which would have to approve it before it would become law.\nCurrent law requires an individual placed in foster care after age 13 to stay in out-of-home care though their high school graduation, GED completion or their 18th birthday in order to keep their college tuition-free. If they are adopted or placed into other guardianship, they lose their eligibility. \nThis discourages \u201colder foster youth to achieve permanency, if it means they will not be afforded the same privilege of attending college \u2014 tuition free,\u201d said the Advocates for Children and Youth, a charity based in Silver Spring, Maryland, in testimony presented to the committee. \u00a0\nCollege hopeful \u201cCameron,\u201d \u2014 a pseudonym to ensure confidentiality \u2014 was placed in foster care after age 13 due to his parents\u2019 substance abuse and domestic violence, according to Erica LeMon, Director of Advocacy for Children and Families at Maryland Legal Aid. \nHis father attended counseling and substance abuse treatment to become a suitable parent for Cameron, allowing the two to reunite over a year later, said LeMon. \n\u201cThis (new) measure would make Cameron eligible for the waiver and enable him to access a college education which otherwise may be out of reach,\u201d LeMon told the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee. \nA study done by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 84 percent of 17- and 18-year-old foster youths report wanting to go to college, but only 20 percent of those who graduate high school attend college, and only between 2 percent and 9 percent actually earn their bachelor\u2019s degree. \nOnly 26 percent of youth in foster care who attend a 4-year college or university will obtain their degree in 6 years, the study found. Almost 57 percent of students who enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities in the fall of 2011 completed school within six years, according to the National Student Clearinghouse, an education non-profit.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have an adopted family,\u201d O\u2019Neale said. Instead, she went to college. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked to have both.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's Juvenile Services Education System faces ongoing challenges in providing quality education comparable to state schools, with issues identified by an independent monitoring unit. Despite a structured program aligned with state standards and the potential for reducing recidivism, individualized educational needs of students pose significant barriers.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Various systematic issues within the Maryland\u2019s Juvenile Services Education System have consistently interfered with students receiving instruction at the same quality as that available to pupils in state schools, according to quarterly reports from an independent monitoring unit. \nThe Juvenile Services Education System, more commonly referred to as JSES, was established in 2004 by the state Legislature in effort to provide a comprehensive education program for children within the state\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services. \nUnder the supervision of the state\u2019s Department of Education, all offenders are required to have six hours of education daily, with lesson plans stemming from the state\u2019s College and Career Readiness Standards, including core courses like language arts, mathematics and sciences. \nInmates who participate in correctional education programs are 43 percent less likely to return to prison than those who did not, according to a study released in 2013 from the RAND Corp., a research organization in California. \nA more individualized structure within Maryland\u2019s juvenile detention and placement centers could be beneficial to the education system, the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit housed in the Office of the Maryland Attorney General found.  \n\u201cWe conduct unannounced visits, but we tend to prioritize facilities that we think are struggling,\u201d Nick Moroney, the director of the monitoring unit, said. \u201cKids are coming in off the street and they have different needs educationally.\u201d\nThe Juvenile Services Education System is a year-round program, unlike a traditional public school that is open for around 10 months with vacation time. Average time for a youth within a detention center is about 30 days, but can vary from a few weeks to six months, according to the Department of Juvenile Services. \nIn FY 2016, the number of youths in detention before conviction was 2,033, while the number of youths awaiting placement in a treatment facility was 742. \nThe three most common offenses for children in detention are second-degree assault, robbery, and burglary, and the age of youths average between 14 and 19 years old, with more than 70 percent between 15 and 17, according to the Department of Juvenile Services. \nAll detention facilities within the Juvenile Services Education System are organized by living unit, which is based on individuals\u2019 charges and the relationships the youths have with one another, rather than by grade level, according to the monitoring unit.  \nGrace Reusing, an assistant public defender within the Public Defender\u2019s Office, has been filing complaints on behalf of families in the Juvenile Services Education System since 2014, all of which state that practices within the program, including failure to provide Individualized Education Programs for those with special education needs, are in violation of federal law. \nWhen a violation is found, the administrative staff of the Juvenile Services Education System is required to address the complaint and document the reparations, according to Deborah Grinnage-Pulley, executive director of the system. \nIn one-and-a-half-hour classes, with about 12 students per classroom, teachers are expected to teach curriculum that fits the needs of each student, regardless of the skill level of each individual. \nIvor Mitchell, the former principal of the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, one of the 13 facilities, served as an employee of the Juvenile Services Education System from July 2015 to July 2017 and was the third administrator at the Baltimore center in four years. He quit his position, he said, because he constantly found himself disappointed with how the system was run.   \n\u201cThey take curriculum from the public school system, and therefore is based on a 10-month scale,\u201d Mitchell explained. \u201cThere are things like spelling bees and math competitions, which is okay, but it really is academic babysitting versus giving them a chance to gain traction.\u201d \nAnother issue accounted for in the monitoring unit\u2019s reports is retaining the teachers, who are hired by the state Department of Education.  \nThe areas in which there are difficulties finding certified teachers include technology education, special education and math, according to Sylvia Lawson, deputy state superintendent for school effectiveness and chief performance officer. \n\u201cOne reason for the issue of (staff) retention is that the surrounding school systems just pay better in the metro area where many of the facilities are located,\u201d Margi Joshi, a monitor of several facilities, said. \nThe state\u2019s Department of Education, with help from the Office of Human Resources, offers a sign on bonus and retention bonus as incentives to hire certified teachers who will continue employment with the Juvenile Services Education System, according to a written response from the Department of Education to a monitoring unit report. The response also states that administrators of the Juvenile Services Education System have recently hired a human resources liaison who is dedicated solely to finding staff for the program. \nMoroney also explained that teachers and principals who work for the Juvenile Services Education System see working year-round as a major issue in terms of their wanting to stay in the system. \nFunding for the program comes from three places: $16,602,385 from the state, making up 83.1 percent of total funding, $1,013,311 from the federal government, with 5.1 percent of total funding and $2,365,221 from local system reimbursement, contributing 11.8 percent of total funding, according to the state\u2019s Department of Education. \nMaryland state Sen. Dolores Kelley, D-Baltimore County, has advocated for an increase in funding for JSES programming in order to attract and retain teachers and other staff.\n\u201cI was really trying to get them to agree to a bill that didn\u2019t get anywhere because I was asking for comparable pay and standards,\u201d Kelley told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \u201cMany things that are very basic that any public school would be taken to the woodshed for not doing, haven\u2019t been done. The vision is just not there on part of the department.\u201d \nThe Maryland Department of Budget and Management determines salary based on a variety of factors, including years of service and regional location of the school, according to the state Department of Education. While annual wages can be similar for teachers in the Juvenile Services Education System and teachers in local public schools, educators who work in the Department of Juvenile Services\u2019 facilities do not get summers off. \nAll facilities are equipped with computer labs, smart boards and iPads for student use, but there are several factors that prohibit the children from benefiting from technology, according to Kelley and agency monitors.  \n\u201cOur observation on that is that technology is not consistently available to kids and teachers in MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) JSES (Juvenile Services Education System) schools,\u201d Moroney told Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service in an email. \u201cStuff breaks and takes forever to get fixed.\u201d \nThe state\u2019s Department of Education provides professional development to teachers on the most effective ways to integrate technology into their daily lessons, according to Grinnage-Pulley. \n\u201cThe kids are very aware of the fact that one really promising way to get back on track is school, they very much understand that,\u201d Eliza Steele, one of the monitors from the Juvenile Justice Monitoring Unit, explained. \u201cBut they\u2019re stuck in a system that doesn\u2019t represent a fair opportunity to get out of it.\u201d \nMitchell, as well as the team of monitors, explained that many educators and principals will have ideas for how to introduce programs that they feel will be meaningful for the kids, but they\u2019ll be shot down by the administration for not following the current system. \n\u201cAdhering to (the Maryland College and Career Ready Standards) is critical to the future success of those students,\u201d Grinnage-Pulley told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service in an email. \u201cThere is plenty of room for teacher creativity within the parameters set forth.\u201d\nGrinnage-Pulley noted that following the standards set in place, which are used by Maryland public schools, are designed to make certain students who return to school do not fall behind. \nAccording to a 2012 study from the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, 66 percent of youth do not return to school after they are released from juvenile services facilities. \n\u201cYou come in thinking that you are going to be a change agent and what you quickly realize is that what they want you to do is be a soldier and implement bureaucratic strategies that you know don\u2019t work,\u201d Mitchell stated. \nCheltenham Youth Detention Center, which was renovated and reopened on Nov. 16, 2016, prides itself on having a computer lab, smart boards in every classroom and elective courses, such as pottery, available in its education hall. \nThe facility is in Prince George\u2019s County and has the capacity to fit 72 male inmates; as of Nov. 17 this year, 42 boys were housed in the facility.\nThe principal of Cheltenham, Michael Dodson, requires his teachers to submit a semester schedule, as well as weekly lesson plans to ensure teachers from the state Department of Education and employees from Maryland\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services are on the same page. \nAs of last month, there were 11 teachers \u2014 six dedicated to core courses, four for classes geared toward special education and one resource teacher \u2014 who work at the facility. \nWhen Dodson arrived in July, he made an effort to transform the designated classrooms into real workspaces by asking the teachers to decorate the white, cinder block walls with things that would typically sit in a public school classroom. The math classroom is filled with colorful posters, while the social studies room has a map on the back wall. \n\u201cThe atmosphere is very important because if a classroom looks like the schools these kids used to go to, they\u2019ll be more engaged and willing to learn,\u201d Dodson explained. \u201cOur kids have great relationships with their teachers, and the ones who have been here longer are very protective of their teachers.\u201d \nHe also requires teachers to incorporate technology \u2014 either the computer lab or iPads \u2014 at least once a week. Programs such as office skills management and career research development are also offered for the young men at the facility. \nWhile Dodson is having success at Cheltenham, the system in its entirety is not promoting the best solution for children in the juvenile justice system, according to the monitoring unit. \n\u201cIt seems to us it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep doing the same thing and seeing the same result,\u201d Moroney said. \u201cMSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) itself really needs to advocate in a much better way for the JSES (Juvenile Services Education System) to be properly resourced.\u201d \nThe state should evaluate the feasibility of the Department of Education Juvenile Services Education System continuing to maintain responsibility for education services within the facilities, monitors wrote in their most recent report.  \nMoroney told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service that he suggests some laws and regulations be revisited, or that pilot programs and charter schools could be the better route for these children. \n\u201cIt should be the most direct, high-impact program because you have an audience that is captive until their release for a lack of a better word \u2014 they want to learn,\u201d Ivor said. \u201cTheir back is against the wall, life has moved on without them and they know it. They want an opportunity not just to learn but to progress their educational futures.\u201d",

    "summary": "Belding High School in Michigan and other schools that have dropped the \"Redskins\" mascot face financial challenges in removing all related imagery and names due to a lack of funds. Some schools have received donations or state assistance to facilitate the transition, but Belding awaits funding from the state and a Native American group to complete their changes.",
    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 On Fall Friday nights, students at Belding High School in Michigan flock to the school\u2019s stadium to cheer on the Black Knights football team. \nOn the way in, they pass by a granite slab with \u201cHome of the Redskins\u201d and a Native American themed logo engraved in the stone.\nThough the school dropped Redskins as their official mascot a year ago, the school district lacks the funds to re-engrave the small stone monument. School officials told Capital News Service that they\u2019re waiting on funds from the state and a Native American group to make the change, along with other necessary alterations in the school district.\n\n\nReturn to \u201cMore than a Mascot\u201d: a Capital News Service examination of Redskins high schools\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re frustrated,\u201d said Michael Ostrander, principal of Belding High School. \u201cWe made a commitment to our community that we were not going to spend any general funds on this change, and we haven\u2019t. But we are really hopeful that that group will come through in the way that they said they would.\u201d\nAt some of the 13 high schools that have dropped the name over the last four years, the moniker and Native American imagery lingers on uniforms, gym floors and in hallways, forcing schools to find the funds to make changes. \u00a0\n\nAt Port Townsend High School in Washington, a donation from a local Native American tribe helped the school transition to the Redhawks.\nA state law that mandated four California schools drop the name also made it possible for the state to reimburse the schools for any necessary changes. \nAt Lamar High School in Houston, Texas, the school district covered the cost of making the switch. \n\nBelding officially dropped the name in December 2016. \u00a0But it began phasing out the term a decade prior in a conscious effort to separate the school from what some consider a racially insensitive mascot. \nWhen it replaced athletic uniforms, it replaced a Native American logo with the letter \u201cB.\u201d And when they renovated parts of the building, they no longer used the name on school structures.\nIn March 2016, a group of parents voiced concern over a T-shirt with a Native American headdress and a skull worn by students at a school wrestling match. They asked the administration to either embrace the current name or select a new one, kicking off a nine-month community dialogue. \n\u201cA group of parents approached the school board and their concern was we either need to use it on uniforms, use it all over the place or move on and have a different mascot,\u201d Ostrander said.\n\nAfter dropping the name, the public chose the Black Knights as its new mascot in March 2017.\nIn addition to re-engraving two granite fixtures, the school district still needs to replace several athletic and band uniforms, as well as some permanent signage throughout the district. The entire district \u2014 which includes two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school \u2014 used the mascot in some manner. \nAccording to Belding Area Schools Superintendent Brent Noskey, Belding needs between $150,000 and $175,000 to make required changes at the schools. They hope to pay for it using a pool of state funds set aside by the state and a Michigan-based Native American group.\n\u201cI have said we are not going to use tax dollars,\u201d Noskey said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s imperative that dollars go towards our students\u2019 education and I don\u2019t want to see money taken away from the kids to fix a logo thing.\u201d\n\nIn January 2017, the Michigan state government and the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi announced that they had jointly agreed to set aside up to $500,000 each year to provide \u201cMichigan schools, colleges and universities with the funds needed to improve curricula and resources related to Native American issues and mascot revisions,\u201d according to a press release.\nBelding still expects to receive a grant from the fund, called the Michigan Native American Heritage Fund, but the process is taking longer than anticipated. The fund is waiting to fill vacant board member positions before distributing money, said Jamie Stuck, Tribal Chairman of the \u00a0Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi.\nAccording to the January press release, the board will consist of two people appointed by the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, two people appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder and the director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights or a designee.\nBut until Belding receives third-party funding, the removal or alteration of symbols associated with the old name will not happen, Noskey said.\n\u201cWhether I\u2019m depending on (the Michigan Native American Heritage Fund) grant or some other grant, it would still take outside dollars to make that happen,\u201d Noskey said.\nWhile schools like Belding await compensation for making the name change, others had no issue getting financial assistance. \nFor Port Townsend high school, the cost of the changing the name from Redskins to Redhawks in mid-2013 totaled $94,235, which included new uniforms, gym floor graphics and other revisions. \nThe school paid $7,694, and the district added $61,541 to make the change. The local Jamestown Tribe of S\u2019Klallam, which supported the name change, kicked in the remaining $25,000. \n\u201cWe just extended an open hand to anything we could do to encourage (them) to make that decision,\u201d W. Ron Allen, travel chairman and CEO of the Jamestown S\u2019klallam Tribe, said. \u201cWe knew that it was going to require a cost.\u201d\nPort Townsend was happy to accept the contribution.\n\u201cThat was solely based on their decision and not any kind of negotiated amount from or by the district,\u201d Port Townsend Principal Carrie Ehrhardt said. \u201cThey said that they wanted to put something towards the mascot change, and we appreciated that.\u201d\nAlthough the tribe provided assistance with the funding, Port Townsend was ready to undergo the name change regardless. It took the school a calendar year to complete the transition.\nThe changes transformed the look of the school, said Athletic Director Lysa Falge.\nSanding the basketball court, painting a new logo, redoing the bleachers and replacing the gym scoreboard were the most expensive changes the school needed to make, about $52,000 in total, Falge said. \n\u201cThere was also the decision to have anything with the Redskin name on it be removed from the school, so older artifacts that had been hanging around, all of those were removed,\u201d she said.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Either publish the word Redskins or don\u2019t print the paper at all.\nThat was the choice school administrators at Neshaminy High School in Pennsylvania presented to student newspaper Editor-in-Chief Gillian McGoldrick when the newspaper balked at using the name of the school\u2019s official mascot. \nMcGoldrick and the paper\u2019s staff went rogue. They printed the paper without using the name, prompting the principal to seize copies of the paper and later suspend McGoldrick as editor-in-chief for a month.\n\u201cI knew that there would be backlash,\u201d McGoldrick said of the June 2014 decision. \u201cI mean, we were defying a directive from the superintendent and the principal.\u201d\n\n\nReturn to \u201cMore than a Mascot\u201d: a Capital News Service examination of Redskins high schools\n\n\nAt several high schools that have dropped the name Redskins in recent years \u2014 or, like Neshaminy, schools that are debating whether they should continue to use the name \u2014 students were deeply involved at every step of the process. In some towns, they led protests against changing the name. At others, they pushed for change and helped select a new team moniker.\n\nAt Goshen High School in Indiana, at a time when the community sentiment about the nickname was split, a committee of 24 students helped lead the move away from the use of the name. The effort was successful, at least in part because \u201cadults get (angry) at other adults, but they don\u2019t get mad at kids,\u201d according to Principal Barry Younghans.\nAt Paw Paw High School in Michigan, athletes opposed to the change showed up after practice, some wearing Redskins apparel, at a board of education discussion about changing the name. The board voted 4-3 to keep the name.\nAt Conrad Schools of Science in Delaware, students were asked to vote on new nicknames after the decision to abandon the name had already been made. They became the Red Wolves, a reference to the local Lenape Indian Tribe\u2019s \u201cwolf clan.\u201d\n\nAt Neshaminy, a school of about 2,500 students in southeast Pennsylvania near the New Jersey border, the debate over the student newspaper\u2019s use of the name has been deeply intertwined with a parallel effort to change it.\nThe seed for the battle between the student newspaper and school administrators was planted when Neshaminy parent Donna Fann-Boyle began denouncing the nickname at school board meetings in 2012. \nFann-Boyle, whose youngest son entered Neshaminy High School in the fall of 2012, spoke at over a dozen meetings, but she failed to convince the school board to stop using the name. \nSo in 2013, she filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, an agency that enforces state laws prohibiting discrimination, setting off a legal battle that continues today. \n\u201cTo have non-native students dressing up in headdresses and painting themselves, it\u2019s a stereotype,\u201d Fann-Boyle, who is part Choctaw and part Cherokee, told Capital News Service. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re saying, \u2018This is what we see Natives as, we don\u2019t see them as modern, productive citizens and a part of modern society.\u2019 They\u2019re stuck in this time warp.\u201d\nFann-Boyle\u2019s actions caught the attention of the editors of the Neshaminy monthly school newspaper, the Playwickian, a name related to a local Native American tribe.\nA Neshaminy High School event board. Photo courtesy Donna Fann-Boyle.\n\u201cWe started listening to (Fann-Boyle), and then we started having debates about (the name) and like, if it was racist,\u201d said McGoldrick, a Temple University junior who was editor-in-chief from 2013 through her graduation in 2015. \u201cWe would have debates after school and one side of the room was for the mascot name and the other was against it.\u201d\nThe debates led to the paper\u2019s editorial staff deciding in the Fall of 2013 \u2014 by a 14-7 vote \u2014 to edit out or redact the \u201cRedskins\u201d name in future editions of the paper. The Playwickian ran side-by-side editorials \u2014 one for the change, one against \u2014 to explain the decision.\nThere was significant backlash from the student body, said Tim Cho, a 2016 Neshaminy graduate who became editor-in-chief after McGoldrick graduated.\n\u201cThere was a lot of criticism over whether or not we liked the high school, whether we felt as if Neshaminy High School was a good place to be,\u201d said Cho, who supported the decision to stop using the name. \u201cBecause a lot of students equated the high school with the mascot itself.\u201d\nA few days after the editorials ran, principal Rob McGee emailed the newspaper\u2019s faculty adviser that he would \u201cban the ban\u201d of the name, as McGoldrick put it.\nMcGee did not return several phone messages and emails from Capital News Service. \nIn November 2013, McGee told the Associated Press he considered the editors\u2019 motives in refusing to use the name as \u201cvaliant\u201d but saw the situation as \u201ca First Amendment issue running into another First Amendment issue.\u201d\nChris Stanley, the school district\u2019s community relations coordinator, declined to comment. \nFor several months, the paper\u2019s editors got around the ban by simply editing the word out. \u201cIt was such an easy switch\u201d changing the \u201cNeshaminy Redskins\u201d to the \u201cNeshaminy football team\u201d, \u00a0McGoldrick said. Then, in June 2014, Neshaminy student Stephen Pirritano submitted an editorial to the Playwickian denouncing the paper\u2019s policy, calling it \u201cStalinesque.\u201d\n\u201cNo student has the right to censor another; in our paper, every student has an equal right to expression allowed under the First Amendment,\u201d Pirritano, who died in 2016, wrote in a letter published by The Morning Call newspaper. \u00a0\nThe Playwickian decided to publish Pirritano\u2019s editorial, in which the word \u201cRedskins\u201d appeared several times, redacted to read \u201cR\u2014\u2014-\u201d. When it submitted the issue to school administrators for review, McGee and then-Superintendent Robert Copeland made clear that the paper had just two choices, according to McGoldrick: publish the paper with the editorial and the word intact \u2014 or don\u2019t publish at all.\nCopeland, now superintendent of the Lower Merion School District, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. McGoldrick said it was a staff decision to print the paper with the letter from the editors, but she personally sent the final go-ahead to the printer with an email.\n\u201cI knew that this was the best decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI made sure to sign my name on the email (to the printer) because I didn\u2019t want anybody else to get in trouble.\u201d\nMcGee initially confiscated some copies from the school\u2019s hallways. He later relented and allowed the paper\u2019s staff to hand out copies of the paper at the 2014 graduation, according to McGoldrick. Copeland called the confiscation of 40 copies of the paper \u201cprudent,\u201d according to a story in the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nMcGee eventually suspended the paper\u2019s faculty adviser, Tara Huber, for two days, and suspended McGoldrick from her editor-in-chief duties. Huber could not be reached for comment. McGee also cut funding to the paper, at the approximate cost of the June issue.\nAround the same time, the district amended its policy that regulates the student newspaper. The policy now requires editors to submit the paper for prior review earlier than before and gives administrators the right to prohibit publication of material \u201cfor any reasonable reason.\u201d\nThe new guidelines also provided some protection from discipline for student editors for editorial decisions, including \u201cthe deletion of the word \u2018Redskin\u2019 from any article or editorial or for objecting to its use in any advertisement.\u201d\nWhile the Playwickian controversy was playing out, Fann-Boyle continued trying to get Neshaminy High School to change its name.\nFann-Boyle resolved to push for a change when she saw the word and Native American imagery everywhere on Back to School Night before her son\u2019s freshman year in 2012. \u201cI had to speak up, I had to say something,\u201d she said.\nThe legal division of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission found probable cause in May that the use of the name in the Neshaminy School District violates the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, which prohibits discrimination because of race or ancestry, according to David Dickieson, an attorney at Schertler & Onorato, who is working with the human relations commission on the case. \nThe human relations commission declined to confirm the finding of probable cause because the case is open, said Christina Reese, a commission media representative.\nNeshaminy School Board member Stephen Pirritano, the father of the student who wrote the editorial arguing against the newspaper\u2019s policy, told Capital News Service in an email, \u201cNeshaminy has always and will continue to be supportive of and display our heritage in a prideful and dignified manner\u2026Neshaminy is a place (where) all peoples\u2019 come together, where the bonds of community make this a special place of growth and opportunity for all.\u201d\nThe case will next go to a public hearing, likely next year, where each side will present expert testimony on the impact of the name on students, according to Dickieson. \u00a0\u00a0\nAt the student newspaper, the debate over using the name has continued. \nIn April 2016, then-co-managing editor Jessica McClelland submitted an article about the school\u2019s annual male beauty pageant, called \u201cMr. Redskin.\u201d\nThe paper\u2019s editors voted to redact the word, against McClelland\u2019s wishes. She appealed to the principal, who upheld her appeal. He directed Tim Cho, the new editor-in-chief following McGoldrick\u2019s graduation, to publish the article on the paper\u2019s website with the word.\n\u201cI was always taught to stand up for what I thought was right, not for what was the easy way out. \u00a0The easy way out would have been to redact the word,\u201d McClelland said in a Facebook message to Capital News Service.\nCho, now a student at New York University, published the article with the name redacted. That \u00a0prompted school administrators to revoke the editors\u2019 access to the website and change the article to include the word. \u00a0\n\u201cIt was my belief that the editors have the authority to determine what the guidelines for editing and publishing are, whereas the principal\u2019s role is more of a watchdog,\u201d Cho said of his decision, in a Facebook message to Capital News Service. \u201cIf we had complied with the principal\u2019s directive without challenging it, I feared it would have set a dangerous precedent.\u201d\nThis time, the consequences were different. No one was suspended and the paper didn\u2019t lose any funding, but the story remained online in its unredacted form. A month later, Cho graduated and then-junior Grace Marion succeeded him as editor-in-chief. School administrators returned access to the website to Marion, but it was a conditional return.\n\u201cI had to be completely supervised by my adviser at all times and the adviser had to change the password after each login so there could be no tampering,\u201d Marion said.\nA year and a half later, the issue is still not completely settled. Marion said she\u2019s told the staff to go back to writing around it, as they had in 2014-2015. \u201cI\u2019ve told the writers to avoid (the name) like the plague.\u201d\n-30-",

    "summary": "Kemp Mill Elementary School in Maryland implements a dual-language program requiring all students to learn in both English and Spanish, with the goal of expanding this approach school-wide by 2022. Fifth-grade teacher Edwin Amaya challenges his students with advanced math lessons in both languages, helping some, like Quenia, develop skills that extend beyond the classroom.",
    "content": "SILVER SPRING, Maryland \u2013\u2013\u2013 Step into Edwin Amaya\u2019s fifth-grade math class at Kemp Mill Elementary School and you may find yourself overwhelmed, a la \u201cAre You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\u201d\nIt likely won\u2019t be the mathematics that gives you trouble, but the language \u2013 unless you speak Spanish.\nAmaya\u2019s students are in the midst of a \u201cSpanish week,\u201d in which they are required to speak the language all day, every day. In Thursday\u2019s class, a small group is instructed at a round table as the others stroll around the room, solving problems taped to objects \u2013 a math scavenger hunt, if you will.\nSince 2001, Kemp Mill has offered dual-language education in English and Spanish. Students enrolled in that program receive half of their instruction in English and half in Spanish.\n\nThe language of choice alternates by week, but is limited to language arts, math, science and social studies classes. All special classes \u2013 physical education, art, music and STEM \u2013 are taught only in English.\nUntil fall 2016, the dual-language education was an optional enrichment program.\nFor the past two years, however, the school has been in the process of requiring the program for its entire student body.\nLast fall, all kindergartners were required to take English-Spanish classes, and this year, first graders joined that cluster as well. Subsequent grades will be added each year until the entire school\u2019s curriculum is taught in English and Spanish for the 2021-22 school year.\nAlthough Kemp Mill is one of three Montgomery County public schools with dual-language education, it is the only school that offers it for all students.\nAmaya teaches his fifth-grade students sixth-grade level math, in both English and Spanish, but his students have much bigger aspirations than being in the advanced math group.\nQuenia, for example, translates for her El Salvadorian mother who doesn\u2019t speak English, which makes her feel \u201clucky.\u201d\nQuenia wants to be a soldier when she grows up because of the opportunities she\u2019s been afforded.\nDual-language education, she says, has given her a glimpse of some of the sacrifices she\u2019ll be making in the military. She explains how her mother offers to take her out for ice cream and to a local park, but she often must stay home, instead opting to work to have a better grasp of English and Spanish.\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si hago esto?\u201d Quenia dreams. (\u201cWhat would happen if I did that?\u201d)\n\u201cThis country has given me food, it\u2019s given me clothes, it\u2019s given me life,\u201d Quenia explains. \u201cAnd I want to fight for this country.\u201d\nHer classmate Daniela, an 11-year old who also speaks Spanish at home, wants to be a lawyer to help those who have been wrongly imprisoned due to language barriers. She says she wants to learn French in middle school, so that she can talk to even more of her peers.\nDaniela has even noticed connections to French, given her English-Spanish background.\n\u201cWe have a French student in our class, who came last year and it was a hard time for him to communicate,\u201d Daniela says. \u201cHe\u2019s learning a lot in English and Spanish. We all helped him, and he\u2019s learned a lot of things.\u201d\nThere are 19 students in Amaya\u2019s class and according to school administrators, no class exceeds 22. Amaya asserts that the smaller classes allow for a more intimate and compassionate environment \u2013 one in which the students are encouraged to help one another acquire secondary language skills.\n\u201cThis develops these students socially,\u201d Amaya says. \u201cIt\u2019s tighter-knit when you\u2019re in dual language.\u201d\n\u201cI feel proud not just of their hard work, but for them to be thinking about that: helping others,\u201d Amaya says with a smile.\nPrincipal Bernard James echoed Amaya\u2019s sentiment, calling the program \u201ca gift.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing our students to be advocates for themselves, their families, others,\u201d James said. \u201cOur world goes far beyond Montgomery County and we\u2019re preparing them to take it, to seize it.\u201d\nJames feels that this \u201c50-50\u201d English-Spanish divide is the best way to bridge the achievement and opportunity gaps.\n\u201cWe have students from all over, so we really look to see if our potential staff are those who can come in and make an authentic connection,\u201d James says. \u201cChildren can tell whether or not you\u2019re authentic.\u201d\nAs of last year, Kemp Mill\u2019s student body was 75 percent Hispanic. That contrasts to Montgomery County Public Schools system-wide, which are 30 percent Hispanic.\nJames bedphasizes the significance of having teachers who are culturally competent and reflect their classroom\u2019s demographic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing our students to be advocates for themselves, their families, others,\u201d James says. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be so prideful to think that the only language that matters is English.\u201d\nSeveral of Amaya\u2019s students understand that, the math teacher asserts.\nHe tells of a student who just arrived from Mexico who doesn\u2019t speak English. His peers have helped him access the class\u2019s online materials and showed him how to line up in between class periods and where to put his backpack.\n\u201cThis is an amazing program,\u201d Amaya says. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely humbling to be a part of it.\u201d",

    "summary": "A state panel in Maryland is reviewing a revised bill aimed at addressing school construction needs and reducing overcrowding, with an estimated $23.3 billion required for statewide improvements through 2023. The legislation seeks to prioritize funding and streamline construction processes to eliminate the use of temporary classrooms and repair aging facilities.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Building additional schools and pushing for more up-to-date, efficient and innovative design proposals is under review by a state panel charged with examining school construction.\nToday, an estimated 65,297 students in Maryland public schools are in temporary classrooms such as trailers, and there is $23.3 billion in estimated statewide school construction needed through fiscal year 2023, according to the Maryland State Department of Education and local schools.\nMaryland Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Anne Arundel and Prince George\u2019s, discussed a revised version of an earlier bill, the Maryland Overcrowding Reduction Act of 2018, at Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the 21st Century School Facilities Commission in hopes of combatting school overcrowding problems across the state.\nThe legislation did not pass last spring, however Rosapepe said he is confident in his revisions and efforts for the upcoming session.\n\u201cFacilities are one thing \u2014 we need them. I don\u2019t see us educating in cornfields. They\u2019re just as important as the programs taught,\u201d said Martin G. Knott Jr., chair of the commission.\nRosapepe explained that this $23 billion construction estimate is unaffordable, and the state and local governments will not significantly boost borrowing for schools in order to pay for all of the projects. All 24 jurisdictions have the ability to build and repair schools at much lower costs, Rosapepe told the commission.\nSchools prioritize their money in different ways, he said, and one school might spend more on a building\u2019s upkeep and another on hiring a new math teacher.\nAccording to the state\u2019s Department of Legislative Services, the average cost for a new public school is $46,000 per student, however recent construction costs in Maryland have ranged from $19,000 to $87,000 per student, a large gap that Rosapepe wants to narrow.\nThe goals of the legislation are to reduce overcrowding, repair old buildings and to end the need for portable classrooms. By designing, approving and building schools faster, reducing costs per student for new schools and incentivizing 21st century construction methods, Rosapepe said, change can be made.\nFor example, Rosapepe said, there no longer is a need for computer labs in schools now that students can bring their own devices. By cutting out an entire room, this is demonstrating 21st-century development techniques and is just one way that schools can be more cost-effective.\nSimilarly, old buildings can be converted to save money. Baltimore\u2019s Monarch Academy, which enrolls 990 students, was formerly a Coca Cola Bottling Plant.\nAccording to Rosapepe, with these strategies, the number of school construction projects can increase by 50 percent at no additional cost by just reducing the average cost per student. However, there would be no mandated changes for local school systems and governments who do not opt in to these recommendations, under the bill.\nAdditional recommendations dealt with setting funding goals and reviewing school designs. Recommendations in discussion included conducting statewide facility assessments and streamlining the review process for projects.\n\u201cThese recommendations are spot on, they are a great step forward and we support the senator\u2019s recommendations,\u201d Stephen Baldwin, a commission member, said.\nBefore the final meeting in December, Knott said, the commission will hone their recommendations and are expecting members of the commission and others to weigh in on them.\n\u201cIf anyone thinks we\u2019re stuck in the past, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re moving forward. We\u2019re taking bold initiatives,\u201d Knott said.\nAt a meeting Wednesday, Maryland\u2019s Board of Public Works unanimously approved $426 million for Baltimore City public schools\u2019 construction and revitalization \u2014 a 21st Century Schools project.\n\u2014Capital News Service correspondent Julie Depenbrock contributed to this report.",

(Georgia Slater/Capital News Service.) \n\t\t\t\t\n\nIn 2016, there were 97,857 students in Maryland enrolled in career and technology education programs across the 237 schools that offered them, according to the Maryland State Department of Education. There were 148 different continuing education programs of study offered and about 38.7 percent of high school students in Maryland participated in these programs.\nA state education commission, helmed by former University System of Maryland Chancellor William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, is weighing these programs as part of its broad look into improving Maryland schools.\nSome commission members said at last month\u2019s meeting they would like to alter the misconception that only students who do not excel in traditional academic subjects should enroll in career and technology programs, and instead that these programs should continue to develop.\nTo do so, commission members want more funding, and more involvement from businesses, said Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore.\n\u201cEvery time we can couple our programs with an industry-related certification or credential, we do,\u201d Karen B. Salmon, state superintendent of schools, told the commission.\nCareer and technology programs throughout the state, like CAT South, measure their success based on the students\u2019 successes. The carpentry program, for example, has had a 100 percent graduation rate, carpentry teacher James Turek told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\nThis year, the school offers 14 different pathways, or career programs, such as cosmetology, automotive technology, carpentry and even marine repair technology, the only program of its kind east of the Mississippi River.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of diverse kids that come through our program with a lot of different needs and wants, and we have many different programs so we can satisfy those needs, which is outstanding,\u201d Turek said.\nAside from learning the \u201chard\u201d skills that are needed for employment, commission members said, all students, including those not enrolled in a career program, should learn about the \u201csoft\u201d skills, including professionalism, attitude, problem solving and cooperative team-building skills.\n\u201cWe get them prepared for employment. They get prepared very differently than kids who go through non-CTE programs because we do offer the competitive edge when it comes to employability: We focus on those skills specifically,\u201d Turek said.\n\u201cWe have a lot of fun here, as stressful as it is,\u201d Jessica White, a junior in the information technology networking program, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different experience and I like it. It\u2019s hands-on and you get to know the material so much better than if you were reading it from a textbook.\u201d\nOnce a student completes a Maryland career program, they also have the option to earn college credits or certifications and licenses.\nMany students at CAT South have already earned certifications or are expecting to earn several by the time they graduate.\nCJ Catner, a junior in the auto technology program, said he has already earned eight certifications, and Olivia Carhart, senior cosmetology student, said she is expecting to receive her state board certification at the end of the school year.\n\u201cThe way that the teachers lay out the curriculum is how to do everything according to state board, so that we know we\u2019re doing everything safely, which has definitely prepared us for the exam,\u201d Carhart said.\nWhite said that CAT South has done a great job preparing her for the computer science field.\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely ready to go into the workplace right away but I want to go to college first to get more degrees under my belt. I have two certifications and working on getting two more,\u201d White said.\nBased on the success of these \u201ccareer and technology education\u201d programs, commission members are seeing the need for even more support.\n\u201cI like the idea of expanding (the program),\u201d said Assistant State Superintendent for the Division of Career and College Readiness Lynne Gilli. \u201cAnything that adds resources to the initiative would help.\u201d\nState aid to local jurisdictions for career and technical education statewide totaled $14,074,309 in the 2015 fiscal year. This fiscal year, the total was $13,677,310.\nIn Maryland, each local jurisdiction determines the total it will allocate for career and technology education, said Bill Reinhard, director of communications for the Maryland State Department of Education.\nTotal federal grants to states nationwide in 2016 topped $1.1 billion for career, technical and adult education.\nFor many students, the program is more than just learning their trade \u2014 it\u2019s about forming relationships.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different type of classroom, you\u2019re not required to be here, it\u2019s a choice. You elect yourself to be here so with that mindset it does make us closer and I probably spend more time with these people than anyone else\u2026I would say it\u2019s like a family,\u201d Carhart said.",

That\u2019s why we come to work everyday,\u201d said Joe Rose, principal at Center of Applied Technology-South, a public magnet vocational trade school in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.\nRose also said his school is \u201cbreaking down roadblocks and barriers\u201d in the technology field, with \u201cquite a few young women\u201d enrolled in their computer science programs.\n\u201cBased on current trends, women will hold only one in five of these \u2018jobs of the future\u2019 in America by the year 2025,\u201d said Hogan, emphasizing the lack of women employed in computer science jobs.\nThe governor also announced a partnership between the state of Maryland and Girls Who Code, creating a Governor\u2019s Club Challenge where the 23 Girls Who Code clubs in the state will compete to present their computer science projects to Hogan.\nThis first-of-its-kind challenge will also create partnerships among education and community stakeholders in the state to launch new Girls Who Code clubs and promote gender equality in the field, according to Hogan.\nHogan said the \u201cACCESS\u201d initiative grew from his membership in a group of nine governors aiming to expand access to K-12 computer science. He joined the group, part of the National Governors Association, in July.\n\u201cWe must spark the interest of students \u2013 particularly girls \u2013 beginning at an even younger age, and we must inspire high school and college students to pursue careers in computer science,\u201d Hogan said at the news conference.\nAlso on Thursday, Hogan signed an executive order directing the state\u2019s Task Force on Cybersecurity and Information Technology, part of the Governor\u2019s Workforce Development Board, to research pathways to grow the Maryland technology sector, as well as propose innovative ways to promote gender and minority equity in the STEM field. A report is due to the governor\u2019s desk by June 2018.",

The Knight Commission expresses deep concern over these issues, emphasizing the need for fundamental changes to ensure integrity and self-governance in higher education athletics.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The president of the NCAA said Monday that the public is losing confidence in his organization\u2019s ability to regulate college basketball and other sports, suggesting that the problem needs to be fixed quickly.\n\u201cI believe strongly today that we cannot go into the next basketball season without seeing fundamental change in the way college basketball is operating,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert told members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics at a meeting in Washington. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t have sufficient confidence in any of us. And I\u2019ll take that on myself, in terms of our ability to solve these issues.\u201d\nCollege basketball has come under special public scrutiny since federal prosecutors brought charges of bribery and fraud last month against 10 men connected to Division I basketball, including four assistant coaches. The charges connected to the University of Louisville led to the firing of basketball coach Rick Pitino.\n\u201cAll of those things are distortions of what the fundamental mission of higher education is all about,\u201d Emmert said of the bribery allegations that led to the indictments. \u201cWe need to be paying very close attention to it. And then we need to make sure that we can demonstrate to the world that we in higher education are capable of self-governance.\u201d\nKnight commission co-chair Arne Duncan said the commission was, \u201cdeeply troubled by the mounting evidence that the NCAA seems to be unable to ensure a level of integrity that has to be a priority in the education and treatment of college student-athletes,\u201d adding that the relevancy of the NCAA was at stake.\n\u201cThese threats to the integrity of college sports compel us to act in a very different way,\u201d Duncan said at a press conference following the meeting. \u201cThe status quo simply isn\u2019t working.\u201d\nThe commission was formed in 1989 to make recommendations to the NCAA to promote student-athlete well-being following a series of scandals. The commission has no formal oversight authority.\nAsked by a commissioner whether the NCAA can survive, Emmert said he believed that his organization was the best possible model for regulating college athletics.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just do the mental experiment and eliminate the NCAA. OK, then what?\u201d Emmert said. \u201cDo we create a federal ministry of sport and let the federal government run it?\u2026Do we create a new commission on college sport in America?\u2026So it really begs the question, sort of the Churchillian notion of it being the worst possible solution except for everything else.\u201d\nCo-chair Carol Cartwright, president emeritus of Bowling Green State University and Kent State University, said at the press conference that the commission was not giving up on letting higher education self-regulate, but \u201cthere need to be some more checks and balances.\u201d\nDuncan, who was education secretary under President Obama, asked whether schools found in violation of NCAA rules should be denied a portion of the billions in federally-backed grants and loans that flow to NCAA schools.\n\u201cIf that money is going out to places where there is academic fraud being perpetuated, is it worth considering?\u201d Duncan asked at the press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s viable and I don\u2019t know if the current administration would be interested, but is there a way to recoup some of that money that went to coursework that wasn\u2019t real?\u201d\nAt the meeting, Emmert also said he had problems with a system that encourages the country\u2019s top basketball talent to enter college and stay for only one year before departing for the NBA draft.\n\u201cIt makes no bloody sense\u2026If someone wants to become a professional athlete and develop the skills of becoming an athlete, they shouldn\u2019t have to go to college to do that,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cOur business is educating and developing young people. It\u2019s not giving them basketball skills.\u201d\nBut commission member David Robinson, a former All-American at the Naval Academy and NBA MVP, said the NCAA should make an affirmative case for the best players to attend college, regardless of how long they plan to stay.\n\u201cWe should be doing a better job of telling these kids, or presenting to them the opportunity of coming to college and the benefits for the long term that they will have,\u201d Robinson said. \u201c20, 30, 40 kids are going to go the NBA. The rest of y\u2019all, we\u2019re your best bet. You need to come here, you need to spend time on our campus.\u201d\n-30-",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 The state\u2019s income threshold for families to qualify for free prekindergarten should be increased by more than 60 percent, a state workgroup told a legislative panel this week.\nA state House and Senate committee weighing universal schooling for 4-year-olds met on Tuesday and acknowledged the need for an increase in funding for the early education program statewide.\nA workgroup formed to study universal access to prekindergarten was charged in April with presenting a report to the governor and the General Assembly by December.\nUniversal, high quality, full-day prekindergarten should be accessible to all 4-year-old children through a variety of programs and providers with a combination of public and private funding, the state\u2019s education department, presenting the workgroup\u2019s findings, told the panel on Tuesday.\nThe legislative committee also took into account a report published in January 2016 by Augenblick, Palaich and Associates, a consulting firm in Colorado, that highlighted the need to offer more access to prekindergarten in Maryland and increase the number of high-quality spots available to serve 80 percent of the state\u2019s 4-year-olds.\nAccording to the Colorado firm\u2019s data, 35.6 percent of 4-year-olds were enrolled in state prekindergarten in Maryland as of January 2016.\nMaryland\u2019s enrollment is similar to neighboring states\u2019 \u2014 such as Delaware and Virginia, which have 5.6 percent enrollment and 17.7 percent enrollment respectively; however, other states have rates of prekindergarten enrollment greater than 70 percent, such as Florida, Oklahoma and Vermont.\nMaryland currently mandates that each district provide at least a half day of free pre-K for 4-year-olds who are in households with incomes at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $45,510 for a family of four, according to Steven Hershkowitz of the Maryland State Education Association.\nThe income level qualification would be raised to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, or $73,800 for a family of four, over a period of at least 10 years if the workgroup\u2019s recommendations are implemented.\nThe workgroup also suggests that funds flow through the state Department of Education and be distributed to school systems and community-based programs through a grant process.\nThe change would improve access for many families in the state who can\u2019t afford a private provider, but also aren\u2019t eligible for free programs.\nSen. Nancy King, D-Montgomery, the chair of the committee, said she supports expanding pre-kindergarten, but that funding will be a challenge.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely a believer in pre-k I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d King said Tuesday. \u201cDifference in abilities is outstanding, from someone who has had pre-k and someone who hasn\u2019t. You wonder throughout the years who does catch up.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Maryland\u2019s Kirwin Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education is scheduled to discuss revising funding for state education, as well as consider the proposal for universal prekindergarten.",

James Clark Scholars Program, and the Clark Opportunity Scholarship for Transfer Students, will receive more funding, influencing the academic careers of over 50 engineering students.\nCourtney Clark Pastrick, the daughter of James Clark, said that her father\u2019s ability to remember his personal challenges while in college allowed him to empathize with the needs of other students. James Clark, an engineering college alum at Maryland and founder of Clark Construction in Bethesda, often hitchhiked to school and relied on financial assistance to get an education.\nBefore he died in March 2015, Clark donated well over $40 million to a variety of projects at his namesake A.

James Clark Scholars Program there. The donation ranked as the largest scholarship gift ever made to that university.\nPublic officials and university leaders, including Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch and University System of Maryland Chancellor Robert Caret attended the announcement.

    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 A fire led to the eventual end of Phoenix \u2014 a groundbreaking Maryland public school program for children with addiction that closed in 2012 \u2014 but the state could see institutions like it rise again from the ashes.\nRecent spikes in the Maryland heroin and opioid epidemic have triggered calls for substantial changes in education systems statewide, and a state work group is weighing the return of recovery schools after a Sept. 7 meeting.\nFor Kevin Burnes, 47, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, attending a recovery school separate from his hometown high school was life-changing.\nBurnes said in a public letter that he began to experiment with drugs and alcohol at age 10, and his addiction to alcohol quickly escalated to PCP. He found himself homeless and was admitted into a psychiatric institute, he wrote.\nHowever, after finding Phoenix, a recovery program for secondary school students with addiction, and attending for two years, his whole life turned around.\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that this program undeniably saved my life,\u201d said Burnes, now a full-time musician living in Frederick, Maryland. \u201cThe largest part of Phoenix\u2019s success was due to the fact that everyone was involved. It was a community effort. It\u2019s a community issue.\u201d\nState legislation that passed this year \u2014 known as the Start Talking Maryland Act \u2014 came into effect in July and directed schools in Maryland to take precautionary measures against opioid exposure and abuse. It also established the work group.\nThe panel is charged with evaluating and developing behavioral and substance abuse disorder programs and reporting their findings to the General Assembly, according to a state fiscal analysis.\nThe legislation additionally requires:\n\u2013To store naloxone in schools and train school personnel in the drug\u2019s administration\n\u2013Public schools to expand existing programs to include drug addiction and prevention education\n\u2013Local boards of education or health departments to hire a county or regional community action official to develop these programs\n\u2013The governor to include $3 million in the fiscal 2019 budget for the Maryland State Department of Education for these policies\n\u2013Schools of higher education that receive state funding to establish these similar policies and instruction in substance use disorders in certain institutions\nMembers of the Behavioral and Substance Abuse Programs and Services Workgroup began to develop ideas on recovery schools at their meeting in Baltimore on Thursday, September 7, 2017. (Georgia Slater/Capital News Service)\nThe Phoenix program and similar secondary schools that followed it were created specifically for students in recovery from substance use disorder or dependency, according to the Association of Recovery Schools.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve known anecdotally for a while, we are starting to finally see with data. These high schools have positive effects on preventing and reducing adolescent alcohol and drug use as well as supporting the abstinence of kids post-treatment and seeing a positive impact on academics,\u201d Dr. Andrew Finch, Vanderbilt University researcher and co-founder of the Association of Recovery Schools told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\nThe first of its kind in the United States, the original Phoenix I school opened in 1979 as an alternative program in Montgomery County, Maryland, that provided both an education and a positive peer culture centered on recovery. Phoenix II followed, also in Montgomery County.\nSince then, about 40 schools have opened nationwide, according to Finch, but none remain in the state of Maryland.\n\u201cIt was amazing the support that the students gave to each other. We would have weekly community meetings where they would praise each other for their commitment, but if they weren\u2019t working toward sobriety these kids were the first ones to rat on each other,\u201d Izzy Kovach, a former Phoenix teacher told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \u201cIt was a real sense of family\u2026\u201d\nCritical to the Phoenix schools were outdoor challenges, said Mike Bucci, a former Phoenix teacher for 20 years, in a report. Along with regular days of classes and support groups, students would go from climbing 930-foot sandstone cliffs at Seneca Rocks, West Virginia, to biking the 184-mile length of the C&O Canal to sailing the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\u201cThese trips helped form lifelong bonds along with an \u2018I can\u2019 attitude,\u201d Bucci wrote.\nThe Phoenix schools at their largest enrolled about 50 students each at a time, according to a Montgomery County Public Schools report.\nAfter years of successful work, the Phoenix schools began to lose their spark. Tragedy struck in 2001 when the Phoenix II school burned down.\nHowever, instead of remaining a standalone recovery school, Phoenix II continued on as an in-school program, and eventually Phoenix I followed, according to Kovach.\n\u201cThe program lost its validity with this model (with students integrated into other alternative secondary programs in the county). The students knew it, the parents knew it, and eventually key staff left because they also saw it was ineffective,\u201d Kovach said.\nEventually, enrollment dwindled down to only three students and the Phoenix program closed its doors in 2012, according to a report compiled by a community advocacy group Phoenix Rising: Maryland Recovery School Advocates.\nFive years later, with the rise in drug use throughout the state, talk of bringing back recovery school programs have reemerged.\n\u201cWhenever you have a program where there aren\u2019t many of them, like recovery schools, people just don\u2019t don\u2019t think of them as an option. But, it is slowly changing and it\u2019s even starting to be picked up by the media,\u201d Finch said.\nThe epidemic is gathering attention and resources in Maryland \u2014 Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency from March 1 to April 30 and committed an additional $50 million over five years to help with prevention.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the number of opioid-related deaths reported in Maryland between Jan. 1 and March 31 more than doubled \u2014 taking the death toll up to 473, according to state health department data. Since then, the work group has begun to look at these numbers and is beginning to discuss various models for these new recovery programs.\nLisa Lowe, director of the Heroin Action Coalition advocacy group, said she fears that the work group will not be able to understand how to move in the right direction without having students, parents or teachers with lived experience contributing.\n\u201cInstead of just guessing what\u2019s going to work, why not ask the people who are living it?\u201d Lowe said.\nThe work group has considered either creating a regional recovery school or bringing the recovery programs into already existing schools \u2014 both models in which Burnes, Lowe and many others are not in favor.\nLowe said students in recovery need to get away from \u201cpeople, places and things,\u201d a common phrase that is used in 12-step programs. With a regional school or an in-school program, Lowe said, it is more difficult to maintain after-school programming and local peer support groups, and it will bring recovering students back to where their problems started.\nThe start-up costs for Year 1 for one recovery school are estimated to range from approximately $2,258,891 to $2,473,891 depending on whether the school is operated only for Montgomery County students or as a regional recovery school, and again should enroll about 50 students age 14 through 21 years (or Grades 8 through 12), according to a state report.\n\u201cThe overdoses are not occurring as much at the high school level, but that\u2019s where they start. They start in high school and they start in middle school. We have to get the program in place so that we don\u2019t have the deaths later on,\u201d said Kovach, the former Phoenix teacher.\nRachelle Gardner, the co-founder of Hope Academy, a recovery charter high school in Indiana, said that these recovery schools are needed all over the country to help battle this substance abuse crisis.\n\u201cAddiction is addiction, when you walk into a 12-step meeting you\u2019re in a room of addicts. You have to treat the addict in itself and we have to meet everybody where they\u2019re at regardless of their drug of choice,\u201d Gardner said.\nThe workgroup is continuing to develop their ideas for recovery schools and are expected to present their findings to the State Board of Education on Oct. 24.\n*The story has been corrected. A previous version misstated the source of a report in the 18th paragraph; and mischaracterized where students were taught once integrated into other schools.",

    "content": "POTOMAC, Maryland \u2013 Ever since Beibei Sun moved to the United States to attend college, she knew she wanted to hold on to her Chinese roots.\nNow that she has two children, she has found the best way to do that is by teaching them how to speak her first language.\nSun, who lives in Potomac, is one of many parents in the Montgomery County area who want their children to learn another language not only for future employment and travel opportunities, but also to keep their heritage alive.\n\u201cWhen you learn a new language, especially in Chinese, you have to learn where the words come from so you learn a lot about the Chinese culture,\u201d Sun said.\nThirty-four percent of Montgomery County\u2019s population is foreign-born. Of the seven districts that make up the county, two are more populated with Chinese-born people than any other nationality, according to a Capital News Service analysis.\nThe large Chinese presence has had multiple effects in the surrounding area, including in the schools.\nSun said she began speaking Chinese to her son and daughter when they were each infants, but when they became older, they stopped responding to her in Chinese. It became harder as they got older to teach them the language, especially after working all day, she said.\nShe then decided to enroll them in a local Chinese school that met for two hours per week to teach the children basic language skills.\nShe soon realized that the Chinese school wasn\u2019t improving her children\u2019s Chinese at a rate she was hoping for.\nFortunately, she heard that Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) offered language-immersion programs starting at the elementary school level. She said she immediately wanted to take advantage of what her local school system had to offer.\n\u201cIn Chinese school, it\u2019s just two hours per week so the kids don\u2019t have the motivation to do the work every day,\u201d Sun said. In the Chinese-immersion programs offered in MCPS, \u201cthey learn a little bit every day so it helps them pick up the language and they do the work each day.\u201d\nIn language-immersion programs, either all or a portion of all core subjects \u2014 for example, math, science, history \u2014 are taught in the target language, according to the MCPS World Language Immersion Program website.\nSun saw immediate improvement in her son Leo\u2019s ability to comprehend the language after he started the program in fourth grade at Potomac Elementary School.\nNow 15, Leo said he feels a sense of duty to learn Chinese since it was his parents\u2019 first language. He is now enrolled in Honors Chinese 5 at Churchill High School.\nAlthough he\u2019s only in his sophomore year of high school, he said plans to continue to take Chinese courses through college as his sister does.\nThe Chinese-immersion programs not only teach the students the language, but also about Chinese culture.\nThat appeals to some parents outside the Chinese community.\n\u201cExposing them to something different from what they know\u2026 it helps their brains grow,\u201d said Lola Tobun, whose son, Ayo, is in seventh grade and enrolled in the Chinese-immersion program at Herbert Hoover Middle School.\nTobun grew up in Nigeria speaking Yoruba and learned French in school. She teaches Ayo and her younger daughter \u2014 who attends Cold Spring Elementary\u2019s gifted and talented program \u2014 about Nigerian culture as well. Although she does not know how to speak Chinese, she was excited that her son had the opportunity to learn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a skill. Every skill you learn now is going to be useful. It doesn\u2019t cost him anything to learn it,\u201d Tobun said. \u201cThe future is Chinese. It\u2019s one of the languages \u2013 from what I\u2019ve read and everything \u2013 it\u2019s a good language and the language of the future.\u201d\nThe language-immersion programs in MCPS began nearly 40 years ago with the installation of a French language immersion program and its goal is to promote bilingual literacy, according to the supervisor of world languages in MCPS, Francoise Vandenplas.\n\u201cIt was all based on interest from parents who found that, in Canada, this was one way that French was alive and well,\u201d Vandenplas said.\nMCPS now offers language-immersion programs in Chinese, French and Spanish at seven elementary schools across the county and four middle schools.\nImmersion programs are not offered in the high schools, but students choose to take their preferred language level course.\nIn determining which specific language would be offered for a school\u2019s immersion program, Vandenplas said that the surrounding demographic plays a major role.\n\u201cA lot has to do with community stakeholders and input from communities where the county is looking into creating a program,\u201d Vandenplas said. \u201cFor Chinese, one (elementary) school is located in Potomac and there are definitely a lot of Chinese-born parents who have an interest in immersion.\u201d\nTobun said that Ayo, who began learning Chinese at Potomac Elementary School, has frequent opportunities to speak Chinese outside of the classroom. She said she has some friends who will speak to him in Chinese.\nSun and her husband are \u201cmostly social with Chinese\u201d and many of her coworkers are Chinese, which gives Leo more opportunities to hear and speak with other people outside of school.\n\u201cI remember\u202612 years ago when I started teaching, only about 10 percent (of the students) came from Chinese-speaking homes,\u201d said Shu-Ju Liu, a Chinese language teacher at Herbert Hoover Middle School. said. She said that now that number has increased to 16 to 20 percent of her students.\n\u201cI think that more and more in the U.S., people realize what an asset it is to be bilingual. Our current world is becoming more global and we can\u2019t assume everyone speaks English,\u201d Vandenplas said. \u201cFor this community, it\u2019s a lot about keeping the heritage alive.\u201d\nAll the other languages offered provide both partial- and full-immersion options. Vandenplas said the Chinese program is only offered as partial immersion because of a variety of factors, including availability of resources and community input.\nAnother factor for only offering partial immersion is that many of the students who are enrolled in the program come from Chinese-speaking homes, so learning fundamentals of English grammar and language are equally important, Vandenplas said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for their learning. For my kids, they \u2018get it\u2019 and understand what another culture is about\u2026. When you talk about another culture, they\u2019re not judgmental about it,\u201d Tobun said. \u201cFor me, I think it is a good idea to expand the program to have every kid living in Montgomery County experience that.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday overturned an Obama administration directive on campus sexual assault that may have long-ranging implications for the more than 300,000 college and graduate students in Maryland. \n\u201cThe era of rule by letter is over,\u201d said DeVos, referring to the 2011 guidelines set in place by President Barack Obama governing cases of sexual misconduct under a 1972 law known as Title IX. \nTitle IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational institutions receiving federal aid and described sexual harassment and violence as forms of discrimination. \nObama\u2019s 2011 \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter set out new obligations that the Department of Education would enforce involving sexual assaults at colleges and universities. Although the letter was not enforced as a law, colleges have followed it.\nCritics of the letter say that the guidelines have been used to unfairly demonize anyone accused of sexual violence without evidence. Supporters say the guidelines make it easier for survivors of sexual assault to report their experiences without fear of backlash.  \nWhile a new framework is still in development, DeVos made clear that the Department of Education would roll back much of the earlier guidance. \n\u00a0\n\nInstead of fighting against for-profit college shams, DeVos has decided to retreat from our fight against campus sexual assault\u2014disgraceful. https://t.co/sRkGeoORtq\n\u2014 Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) September 7, 2017\n\n\u00a0\nUniversity of Maryland spokeswoman Katie Lawson said the school remained committed to \u201ca campus free of sexual violence.\u201d \n\u201cThe university will advocate for the safety of our students as we await the public review period announced today by the Department of Education,\u201d she said.\nThe Maryland Higher Education Commission declined to comment on the matter when contacted, saying it was too early to assess the impact of the announcement. \nAFT President Randi Weingarten, a sexual assault survivor, accused DeVos of siding with \u201cthose who want to roll back the clock.\u201d\n\u201cDeVos is right that we need systemic reform, but it\u2019s this country\u2019s ingrained campus rape culture that needs changing, not the law that challenges it,\u201d Weingarten said in a statement. AFT, known as the American Federation of Teachers, represents 1.7 million primary and secondary school teachers, college professors and staff, government employees and healthcare workers.   \nCalling DeVos\u2019s move \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in a tweet, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., stated that the priorities of her agency would be better focused on \u201cfighting against for-profit college shams.\u201d\nThe YWCA USA tweeted that \u201csurvivors deserve an administration that stands with them.\u201d \nUnder the Obama administration guidelines, schools were told to use the lowest standard of proof, called \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d in prosecuting sexual assault cases. \nIn an address at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School, DeVos said colleges must raise the burden of proof in order to protect the rights of both victims and those that they accuse because \u201cthe system established by the prior administration has failed too many students.\u201d\n\u201cAny perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation, but if everything is harassment, then nothing is harassment,\u201d said DeVos, a statement which drew criticism for equating the harm done to falsely accused students with the suffering of assault survivors.  \n\u201cWashington has insisted that schools step into roles that go beyond the mission of these institutions,\u201d said DeVos. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean schools don\u2019t have a role. They do. But we should also draw on medical professionals, counselors, clergy, and law enforcement for their expertise.\u201d\nDeVos consistently returned to the theme that schools must be mindful of all the rights of all students both victims and accused students, saying that the current system provided no justice to either party and that educational institutions were often too quick to punish students through school tribunals based on flimsy evidence. \n\u201cEvery survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously,\u201d said DeVos, adding that those accused of sexual misconduct must also not feel like they have been judged guilty without a fair chance to defend themselves. \nDeVos\u2019 proposed changes were praised by Robert Shibley, executive director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit group that aims to defend individual rights at colleges and universities including \u201cfreedom of speech, legal equality, due process, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly as a civil libertarian you know it\u2019s very obvious that it kicked of an effort by the department to redefine Title IX enforcement in a way that made it clear that due process was going to be in some cases totally ignored in favor of attempts to fight sexual assault on campus,\u201d said Shibley.\nWhile DeVos said the system can improve to become more \u201ceffective and fair,\u201d some advocacy groups believe that these new guidelines will only help the accused.\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, blasted DeVos, saying she was continuing \u201ca pattern of undermining survivors\u2019 rights, once again showing a clear lack of understanding or empathy for the millions of students who have experienced sexual violence on campus.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Secretary DeVos just made an open invitation to colleges to once again sweep this national epidemic under the rug, which could discourage women and men on campuses across the country from reporting sexual assault and deprive survivors of the justice they deserve,\u201d Murray said.  \n\u201cWe know that no system is perfect, but we absolutely disagree that what (DeVos) is trying to do is make the system more fair,\u201d said Annie E. Clark, executive director of End Rape on Campus, a national nonprofit organization involved in organizing student survivors and families who protested outside of DeVos\u2019s speech. \n\u201cSurvivors and advocacy groups were not a part of this announcement or meeting \u2013 in fact we were not even allowed in the room,\u201d said Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s a veiled insult. This is a blatant attack on the civil rights of survivors.\u201d\nHigh school and university students and their families were part of the crowd gathered outside to share their stories around issues of sexual violence and upholding Title IX, said Clark.\n\u201cWe were told by reporters and others in the announcement with DeVos that they could hear us chanting outside,\u201d said Clark. \u201cSo as she was talking about listening to survivors, you had this very clear picture that survivors were not being allowed in.\u201d \n\u201cSurvivors can\u2019t learn when their rapists sit behind them in math class, or live down the hall of their dorm, especially without accommodations and support from their schools,\u201d said Advocates for Youth in a press release. \u201cBut too often, schools don\u2019t respect survivors\u2019 rights, provide help, or investigate their reports.\u201d \nKnow Your IX, a project of Advocates for Youth that works directly with students, was one of several groups protesting. \n\u201cToday, Secretary DeVos sent the message to student and survivors across the country that the Department of Education doesn\u2019t have their back,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cDeVos and the Trump Administration have given us every indication their goal isn\u2019t equality, but helping abusers and rapists avoid accountability.\u201d\nOne of Devos\u2019 main points was that the accused don\u2019t get due process because colleges want to help appease the victim. \n\u201cThe notion that schools must diminish due process to better serve the victim only creates more victims,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cThe rights of one person can never be paramount to the rights of another.\u201d\nWhen asked whether he believed the changes DeVos proposes will lead to an increase in campus sexual assault, Shibley responded \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s very much of a risk that all of a sudden people who are engaging in sexual misconduct on campus will go scot free.\u201d\nThe specifics of a new process for handling sexual assault on campuses are yet to come.\n\u201cWe will launch a transparent notice and comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way,\u201d the secretary said. \u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective and fair system.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Maryland lawmakers voted Thursday to override Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of a bill that would specify which measures could be considered when determining a school\u2019s quality, prohibiting student testing from being one of them.\nThe bill restricts the state\u2019s ability to intervene in failing schools, which opponents worry is intended to limit the creation of charter schools and voucher systems.\nThe House of Delegates passed the override of the governor\u2019s veto 90-50, and the Senate passed it the same day, 32-15.\nHogan, a Republican, vetoed House Bill 978, known as the Protect Our Schools Act of 2017, Wednesday, saying the bill weakens school accountability, according to a release from the governor\u2019s office. In the press release, Hogan urged legislators to put aside politics and sustain the veto.\nThe Maryland State Board of Education and the Maryland State Department of Education have sided with the governor in opposition to this bill, according to the release. \nThursday morning, advocates for the bill gathered at a rally to call for an override. Those present included representative from the Maryland State Education Association, the Maryland Parent Teacher Association and some lawmakers. \nThe bill would help accommodate the needs of the students and allow parents to be involved in the process, Delegate Mary Washington, D-Baltimore, told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \u201cWe need to do more to end disparities (in education) \u2026 we cannot do that giving control to the state,\u201d Washington said.\nBill Sponsor Delegate Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, acknowledged the common goal that both sides of the argument shared. \u201cI\u2019m glad we can agree every kid deserves a good education,\u201d Luedtke said on the floor.\nAlthough the State Board of Education opposes the bill, people who are involved in the everyday lives of children, like teachers and parents, support the bill, according to Luedtke.\nMultiple delegates opposed to the bill referred to it as a \u201cstatus quo\u201d initiative on the floor, saying the bill will not bring any noticeable change that would benefit students.\nDelegate Nicholaus Kipke, R-Anne Arundel, the House minority leader, said on the floor that this bill is not complicated. \n\u201cIt traps students in failing schools and lessens accountability in the bureaucracy in education,\u201d he said. Kipke made a point to say the legislation is regressive and takes tools away from the state. \nSince both chambers voted to override the governor\u2019s veto, the bill will become law July 1.",
