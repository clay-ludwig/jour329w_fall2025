    "content": "April Christina Curley\nCampaign email: electapril@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.electapril.com\nAge: 35\nEmployment: Engagement and partnerships manager, Last Mile Education Fund*\nEducation: Master of Arts in Teaching, Johns Hopkins University\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a former teacher, I fundamentally believe that Baltimore City has the most brilliant, innovative and curious kids I\u2019ve ever met. I also believe that Baltimore\u2019s teachers are the most hard working, passionate and committed people on earth. I am running for Baltimore City School Board because I fully intend to influence and create policies that ensure our kids and teachers are prioritized fiscally and socially, allowing all of Baltimore to flourish as a result of producing talented, creative young people who will undoubtedly change the face of this planet for the better.\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nFor 17 years I\u2019ve built my career centering marginalized groups, working to drastically change the trajectory of the lives of students through education and technology. Recently, I spent six years at Google working to expand access to opportunities in tech for Black and brown students, including low-income students, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students. Formerly, I was a diversity recruiter for Teach for America after first serving as a high school social studies teacher in West Baltimore. I am a proud Baltimorean who vows to live and work in this amazing city to make the quality of life better for all children and families.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe honorable and late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Baltimore) is a public leader that I admire and someone who I have channeled when thinking about the impact I hope to have on the children and families of Baltimore City, and the world at-large. When I was in high school, I had the amazing opportunity to participate in a student brain trust hosted by Delegate Cummings where he welcomed the voices of youth in his community engagement strategy. His leadership has influenced the way I operate as a young leader, and if elected to the school board I will absolutely model my community engagement efforts after his \u2013 one where youth are at the center and where their voices are prioritized in every decision made.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThe most important issue facing the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners is teacher recruitment and retention. Bringing in qualified educators and working to keep them in the classroom will require a drastic and radical commitment from the school board to significantly increase base salary for teachers with opportunities for achievable performance bonuses, offering a manageable workload with supportive administrators. When we center the experience of teachers, we know that our children will reap the benefits in very tangible, measured ways. I also want to ensure that every school staff person has access to free and quality mental health services as long as they are employed by BCPSS.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nSchool safety is a top priority for me and in order to best support teachers and students, an increase in mental health services is absolutely imperative. I would work to ensure that budget allocations prioritize the mental and behavioral health of all students, teachers, and families. I would also push for a stronger health and wellness curriculum with the hope of teaching students how to be better advocates for themselves. Finally, I would work to remove police officers from schools and instead use that budget to increase the presence of social workers and other mental health professionals.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nAs an undergraduate history major and former high school social studies teacher, I believe that the way history is taught in city schools is appropriate, but has room for improvement. I would like to have more resources that center the students that we serve, including using resources specifically reflecting the lived experiences of marginalized groups throughout history. Critical race theory is very much part of that narrative.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nAbsolutely not. No question about it. Reading is a human right.",

    "content": "Campaign email: scanlanforeducation@gmail.com\nWebsite: www.scanlanforeducation.com\nAge: 68\nEmployment: Retired.\nEducation: Master of Science; Western Maryland College/McDaniel College\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\nI am running for the Board of Education to bring reason and community back to our school system. Education starts in the classroom, and excellence is achieved when great educators interact with children in a safe and orderly learning environment. I have three top priorities. First, we must focus on our students in the classroom to fill learning gaps and get back to on-grade-level instruction. Secondly, we must attract and retain a highly qualified staff through competitive salaries in a supportive work environment. Finally, it is imperative we bring our schools back as community centers where families can come together to celebrate their schools and their neighborhoods.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a retired classroom teacher with 33 years of experience in Carroll County Public Schools. I started out as an English teacher and became a high school Reading Specialist who is also ESOL certified. I have worked with every academic level, but as a Reading Specialist I worked with some of the most vulnerable students. Whether it is those with disabilities or those living in poverty, we must meet the needs of every student. As a parent and a career educator, I understand what is needed to ensure our students are college and career ready. We must focus on learning and excellence. As a school system, we must provide our students every advantage to succeed and achieve their goals.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nOne public leader I admire is Jimmy Carter, not because of his presidency but because of what he has accomplished since then. The Carter Center has a far-reaching world health program. Combatting and eradicating the Guinea Worm, river blindness and malaria are just three of the many initiatives worldwide. Besides maternal and child health, they also advocate for mental health awareness here in the United States. Into his 90s, Carter has volunteered with Habitat for Humanity and taught Sunday school classes at his hometown church. Working toward world peace by monitoring democratic elections in 39 countries is another important enterprise of the Carter Center.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nOne of the many pressing issues we face is low morale and burnout of our staff. The last two years were incredibly taxing on our educators. From learning loss due to the pandemic to the unprecedented levels of emotional and behavioral issues of students, administrators and teachers feel overwhelmed and underappreciated. Teaching is a hard job. Educators work far more hours in a day than many people know, and it can be emotionally draining. First, we must show our educators respect. Let them do their jobs without questioning their motives. More importantly, we need to listen to them because they are the ones on the front lines. Second, teachers must be compensated as professionals.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nSchool safety is always a concern in our world today. Carroll County, in partnership with the Sheriff\u2019s Department, has an excellent SRO program. The (school resource) officers are hand-picked and trained to work in our schools as partners. They are trusted and respected by students and staff alike. Additionally, mental health awareness and access are crucial to maintaining safe schools. We need more mental health counselors available for our students. The final component is creating a culture of kindness and acceptance in each school so students feel safe and valued. School-wide programs and peer-to-peer programs like Sources of Strength are very effective.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nPart of my job as a reading specialist was to push into US History and Government classes, so I have seen the textbooks and lessons firsthand. The lessons and texts are objective, and our teachers are professionals. My only concern is the amount of content our teachers need to cover in such a limited time frame. Much of the Government class is preparation for the Government High School Assessment which tests basic knowledge of how government functions. In US History, students learn an overview of our nation\u2019s past. There is not enough time to get into too much depth, so the focus is on the major events and eras in US history.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nAn important part of the Media Specialist\u2019s job is to build a library collection that meets the needs of their school\u2019s community, so that will be different for every school. It is literally impossible for the media specialist to read every book in the collection; consequently, they must rely on professional journals, reviews, and recommendations when building a library. Sometimes a book is selected that is not appropriate for the collection, and as a professional they may pull that book from circulation. While some sensitive books may require parental permission to check out, there is no place for racist or sexually explicit material in a school library.",

    "content": "Campaign email: amydod1@yahoo.com\nAge: 47\nEducation: Bachelor\u2019s Degree, Business, Chowan University.\nWhy are you running for the school board?\u00a0\u00a0\nThere were several factors that motivated me to take this step. Just one of those being I have a child with Down Syndrome, and I feel that children with special needs need a voice at the board level. I am able to take the time to advocate for my children. Not all parents are able to do that for a number of reasons. I am willing to take up that mantel and work for all children in our county.\u00a0\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\u00a0\nI am extremely invested in the success of our schools, as I have three children that attend public schools here in our county. Not all candidates have ever utilized public school for their own children. I am also an advocate for students with IEPs (individualized education programs) and students in the special needs community. I have experience in both areas and I am willing to work for all students in that category and all students in general. My husband is a teacher in a neighboring county, and his insight into how to best support our educators is valuable. Finally, I am endorsed by the local Talbot County Education Association.\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nThere are so many answers. I think Dolly Parton is a national treasure. She does so much for children in our county with her free book program, Imagination Library. She also has funded relief for wildfires in Tennessee as well as offering to pay for higher education for employees of her Dollywood park. She is an example of leading with her heart to truly care for other people.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nThis is a tough question because I feel we have many issues. Behavior issues, vaping and others are on my list. But in order to successfully run schools we have to have schools fully staffed with qualified individuals. One does not have to look far to know we have a nationwide teacher shortage. We need to ensure we are retaining our qualified teachers as well as recruiting new teachers. We need to make sure we are supporting these teachers so they will want to stay. We need to appeal to all that our beautiful county has to offer in recruiting new teachers.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nYes, after Uvalde how can you not have concerns? The school system rightfully keeps the security plans under wraps to keep them secure. I would want to review the current plan before considering what changes may or may not be needed. I have worked in the safety industry my entire career and have numerous contacts that specialize in safety both at the federal and private level.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI do not currently have a concern. I would need to do a deep dive into the current curriculum, above what I already know. However, the curriculum is given to the schools from the State Board of Education.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nI am not a fan of book banning in general.",

I have been actively involved in advocating against permanent school closures, democratizing our school board and ending the school-to-prison pipeline. I am a former foster care youth and someone with learning differences. I felt a sense of urgency to bring my lived experience and parent voice to the school board. I believe we can have healthy communities if we strengthen our public school system.

In council and board work, I have worked very hard to democratize decision-making processes, improving community engagement, and focusing on mental health policy in education. I am someone who doesn\u2019t shy away from tough conversations. I think that when you focus on the biggest issues being raised by the community you improve morale and create better policies.\u00a0\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\nI cannot pick just one leader. The leaders I admire are the grassroots community leaders. Sometimes they do not have a title, are unpaid and do not get recognition. I truly admire these leaders because they see an issue and take on doing the thankless work to improve conditions for everyone.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\nI believe the biggest issue facing our school board is morale. I think the public is losing faith in the direction of our school system. I have seen parents, students, and teachers raise valid issues. I think the public is coming to the table with good faith and sometimes there is a disconnect in leadership to lean into those uncomfortable conversations. I see people who are unwilling to admit there is a problem publicly and meet with the public. I believe the best way to improve this is to include stakeholders in decision-making processes. I know these issues are tough but if we work together we can fix them.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\nI am very concerned about school safety! Our schools are not immune to issues that affect our communities. Whether it is mental health, substance use, gun violence, poverty, or other trauma, we have to have the resources to address all of these issues in the school system. We know these are issues impacting students outside of the school building so we need to be equipped to address them in the school building.\u00a0 I think we need to give every student access to resources. We need to train our staff and have our school system commit to trauma-informed care initiatives. All of these are barriers to our students\u2019 participation in the classroom.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nI think we are headed in the right direction for history curriculum. Over the years we have become more inclusive.\u00a0 My concerns are the efforts to make our history curriculum less inclusive and less historically accurate. I would like to see more local history in our school curriculum. I know there are so many contributions of local artists and dance in our city\u2019s history that should be included.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nI do not believe in banning books. I believe censorship is a slippery slope and I have seen efforts to ban books actually lead to students seeking out those banned books. I think we should be encouraging literacy and critical thinking. I know for myself, books have sparked tough and healing conversations. Getting uncomfortable and challenging yourself and your perception of the world is a healthy process.",

I have spent my entire career in health care finance. I am currently a senior director of finance for a large health care system here in Maryland. I believe my background will be advantageous as we work with a tight budget, year in and year out. Currently, 88% of the CCPS budget is allotted toward salaries and benefits. It will be important that the next board has a strong finance background to ensure every tax dollar allocated to CCPS by the county commissioners is spent wisely.\u00a0\nPlease name a public leader you admire and explain why.\u00a0\u00a0\nI would say local (state legislative) delegation Justin Ready, Haven Shoemaker, Susan Krebs and April Rose. They have always put Carroll County first in Annapolis and fight hard for our county to have a voice. I also applaud their efforts during COVID to get our schools open and push back on the state\u2019s endless mandates. Without their efforts I am not sure we would have opened schools or allowed mask optional when we did in Carroll County.\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\u00a0\u00a0\nWe need to focus on academics that are age-appropriate and get back to education. Even after two years of successful summer learning, our students are still recovering from learning loss. Closing that gap and creating confident students fosters lifelong learning.\nAdditionally, the state\u2019s restorative justice policy has gone too far to protect bullies at the expense of our students receiving a quality education. I will work with the MSDE (Maryland State Department of Education) to change the state\u2019s policies and give power back to local school districts to hold bullies accountable for their actions. No kid should be scared to go to school and face endless bullying.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nCarroll County has a tremendous partnership with the sheriff\u2019s department to ensure our schools are safe for our children. I would like to see the SRO program expanded so schools don\u2019t have to share resource officers. More importantly, we need to focus on ensuring our kids have the support necessary to keep them from getting to a point where they want to hurt themselves or someone else. Focus on identifying students who are struggling and intervening early. As mentioned earlier we also need to hold bullies accountable so our kids can go to school free of the fear of being bullied.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nI believe we do a very good job teaching history in CCPS. I want to ensure that continues if elected. I believe it is important we teach history as it occurred so our kids can learn from who occurred, good and bad. Part of why we teach history is so we learn from the past; continue the positive and not repeat the mistakes.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\u00a0\nBooks need to be age-appropriate. I find this question interesting as it gets asked a lot. Many people are quick to judge when books get removed from schools however, this has been going on for years. There is already a long list of books that are not allowed in schools and I believe we must continue to monitor what is being presented in our schools to ensure they are age-appropriate. Removing inappropriate books from schools is nothing new yet, for some reason it has become a hot topic of late.",

To restore parent/teacher control over what our children are learning and when they learn it. To store the ability to think critically about facts and circumstances instead of reacting from emotions. Schools are currently creating children who can\u2019t cope with the world because they are being taught to be guided by their emotions.\nWhat makes you a good candidate for the board?\nI\u2019ve been advocating for parent and student rights in education for over a decade. I\u2019ve sued FCPS and have a proven record of fighting for what\u2019s right for parents and their children.

There is too much focus on emotions, sexuality, racial division and political activism. I want to remove all of that from the classroom. These are family topics of discussion, not government school discussions. Government has no place teaching its preferred ideologies.

Restoring consequences for bad behavior is a priority.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t teach history without infusing emotions and racial bias, that\u2019s very concerning. Children graduate not knowing we are a country founded on Judeo-Christian principals. We teach them to believe America was founded on slavery and white supremacy. That should bother every parent and taxpayer funding those lies.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nYes I believe certain books have no place in a school library. We recently got \u201cGender Queer\u201d removed from one of our school libraries. It\u2019s not just vulgar, it meets the federal definition of \u201cpornography.\u201d",

In doing this we can return our schools to the hands of the community where it rightfully belongs. The fact that for the first time Baltimore City is electing representatives on the school board will break the bonds of silence. The elected representatives have a duty that cannot be stifled. They must talk to and listen to their constituency so they can effectively represent the people that put them there.

You cannot do something well externally which you do not do well internally.\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\u00a0\u00a0\nWe see many examples of when the pot boils over, time and time again. We make grand proclamations and promises of further actions. While we in awe watch as the kettle explodes. We spend no time looking at the fire growing under the pot. This fire that is constantly getting hotter is the fire of culture and climate. This needs to be looked at through the mirror of the culture and climate from which our students hale. It is only with a wholistic approach realizing we are all stakeholders and contributors to this culture. We need to lower this heat of tension and grow an atmosphere of combined objectives for not only our children but our entire community.\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district\u2019s schools, and if so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0\nI am a history teacher in the ESOL Program. The precarious thing about teaching history is that we are all looking at it from one historical perspective or another. Very rarely is it taught with the objectivity and lack of bias that allows young scholars to freely form their own perspectives.\u00a0 The prevailing trends are carried in the heart of the curriculum, and the result is just mimicking of those presumed facts. History should be taught in a wide open exploratory fashion to help in the formation of young scholars perspectives of the past that will lead to their actions tomorrow.\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\u00a0\nNever.",

Teachers can make significantly more if they go to Montgomery County, which touches our county or more if they go to Howard County, which also touches our county border. This has been a significant issue for a long time.\u201d\n\u00a0In May, Montgomery County Public Schools gave their staff a 6% increase in salaries, citing the raise as an effort to help attract new staff and retain current teachers.\nIn Anne Arundel County, the Baltimore County pact is particularly significant.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are preparing to begin our negotiations in a few weeks,\u201d said Nicole Disney-Bates, president of the Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are prepared to continue to have conversations with the superintendent, board of education members, county council, county executive and the community at large as to the best ways to continue to attract and retain teachers in Anne Arundel County.\u201d\nBaltimore County\u00a0 teachers paid close attention to other counties\u2019 pay scales and working conditions during their months-long negotiations.\u00a0 They knew they wanted salaries comparable to the counties that were luring their teachers away, said Cindy Sexton, president of the Teachers Association of Baltimore County.\n\u201cWe know people are leaving Baltimore County,\u201d Sexton said.\u201cTeachers are looking and saying, \u2018Oh, I can make more in Howard [County],\u2019 and then potentially going there.\u201d\n\n\nThe new compensation package includes a 3% cost-of-living pay increase for all staff members, mid-year step increases, retention bonuses for all staff and additional bonuses for the school employees with 30 or more years of service.\nDuring a press conference to announce the agreement, Baltimore County Executive John Olszewski said retaining teachers was an impetus for the agreement now.\n\u201cEducation has been and will continue to be our top priority in Baltimore County,\u201d Olszewski said. \u201dI am proud that we were able to come together to announce well-deserved pay raises for our hardworking educators and support employees.\u201d\nTeacher retention is a major concern for Maryland school systems. In the last academic school year, 9.1% of Maryland teachers left the profession, according to the Maryland State Department of Education.\u00a0\nSome counties reported having as many as 400 open positions as the school year was scheduled to begin.\u00a0\nThe state has taken measures to ensure that an adequate number of teachers remain.\u00a0\nIn July, the state board of education approved a measure that would allow more than 3,000 educators to continue teaching with a conditional teacher certificate for another two years as long as the teachers meet certain other requirements.\u00a0\nTeachers have continued to voice concern regarding salaries, working conditions and overall teacher workload.\n\u00a0\u201cTeachers have been the public punching bag for decades.\u201d Dirks said \u201cAll this frustration happens when you treat people like they don\u2019t matter and that they should be servants when in fact, they\u2019re highly trained professionals.\u201d\nThe situation in Maryland is reflected across the country. Other states have also sought to increase pay to retain their teachers. Alabama lawmakers, for example, passed a series of measures aimed at providing significant bonuses and financial incentives.\u00a0\nSome states have taken dramatic measures to ensure that there are enough educators.\nIn Texas and Arkansas, school districts have decided to embrace four-day school weeks to save on operations and staffing costs.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS \u2013 Arianna Dastvan remembers using her birthday money as a child to buy an overhead projector for her bedroom. There, she would emulate the teachers she admired as she instructed her stuffed animals.\nDastvan recalled how she would stay late and arrive early, so she could assist her elementary school teachers with their work. She loved being in the classroom.\nSo, she became a teacher, but six years into her career, Dastvan, 31, quit her job with the Baltimore County Public Schools.\n\u201cI had an emotional breakdown from being so disrespected by students and parents that one day, I was just like, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d Dastvan said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019\u201d\nScores of Maryland public school teachers are saying the same thing, and their departures are creating shortages throughout the state\u2019s education system.\nIn the last academic school year, 9.1% of Maryland teachers left the profession altogether, according to the state department of education. Consequently, at the beginning of this year, county school systems across the state reported hundreds of teacher vacancies they needed to fill.\n\nIn an effort to quickly staff classrooms and retain teachers, some school districts are raising wages.\nBaltimore County Public Schools announced a pay package on Tuesday, which includes a 3% \u201ccost-of-living increase for all staff members retroactive to July 1\u201d and retention bonuses for teachers. In May, Montgomery County Public Schools gave their staff a 6% increase in salaries, citing the raise as an effort to help attract new staff and \u201cencourage (staff) to stay with us,\u201d said Monifa McKnight, superintendent for MCPS.\n\u201cTeachers have long known their profession is a difficult job. How many professions, for instance, expect their employees to pay for most of the materials they need to do their job?\nThey work through long hours for relatively low pay, administrative red tape and summers spent preparing for the upcoming school year.\nNow, after two years of hybrid learning, social distancing, masked-up teaching and the associated anxiety, many Maryland teachers are burned out and are leaving, either to early retirement or in search of a new career.\nThe teacher exodus, according to a survey this year of 1,324 teachers, appears to be the result of \u201ca deep disillusionment of many teachers who feel overworked, underpaid, and under-appreciated.\u201d\nThe Merrimack College Teacher Survey, which was commissioned by the Winston School of Education and Social Policy at Merrimack conducted by the nonprofit EdWeek Research Center, found that in the last 11 years, the percentage of teachers who believe the community treats them with professionalism has dropped from 77% to only 46%.\nJust 12% of teachers, the survey found, were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their jobs. Additionally, more than four in ten said they were \u201cfairly likely\u201d or \u201cvery likely\u201d to leave the profession in the next two years.\nConsequently, the study concluded, the flow of teachers leaving the profession have the \u201cpotential implications for a once-in-a-generation shift in the teaching profession.\u201d\nDonna Christy, president of the Prince George\u2019s County Education Association, agrees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst it has ever been right now,\u201d Christy told the Capital News Service. \u201cWe\u2019re at the tipping point. It\u2019s either make it or break it. I don\u2019t see anything that says we are going to make it. So, it looks like it\u2019s going to break.\u201d\nDastvan taught math at Golden Ring Middle School in Rosedale for five years.\nDastvan said she was sexually assaulted by a Golden Ring student in 2019. Dastvan said she reported the assault to the school\u2019s administration, but she did not receive the support she expected.\nJanelle Brubach, a former Baltimore County public school teacher, now works as a Realtor for RE/MAX in Fallston. Brubach left teaching in March 2022 after 14 \u00bd years. Her doctor would not medically release her back to the classroom due to job-related anxiety attacks. (Ron Harris/Capital News Service)\u201c\u2018Ms. Dastvan, what do you expect?\u2019\u201d she said was the gist of the response. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s just a 12-year-old boy.\u2019 That was the final straw for me. I transferred that year.\u201d\nShe said she transferred to General John Stricker Middle School in Dundalk.\nAfter two months at the new school, Dastvan said she suffered a mental breakdown. She said she checked herself into Sheppard Pratt Adult Day Hospital and received outpatient care for a month and half.\nFollowing treatment she returned to teaching, just as the coronavirus pandemic began. Like teachers across the country, she transitioned to remote teaching. Dastvan decided to leave teaching and resigned in August 2020.\nShe now works remotely for Realestaged, a furniture staging company for real estate agencies. Dastvan says she loves her job now, where she can complete her work from the comfort of her home with her dog by her side.\nValerie Coll spent 32 years teaching elementary students in the Montgomery County Public School system before retiring in 2021.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most important job in the world,\u201d Coll, 62, said. \u201cWhat kept me (teaching) is that you knew everyday something happened in the course of the day for you or for some or all of the children, that there was a point in the day where everything was where it needed to be.\u201d\nColl retired early and decided to run in the upcoming election for the Montgomery School Board of Education, she said, so she could impact the decisions that affect educators.\nShe said one of the most difficult things affecting teachers are decisions made about the classroom by non educators who do not understand the differing needs of every classroom.\n\u201cIf I'm working in a kindergarten classroom, the amount of time that I'm actually given to make sure that the children in front of me have the space and the time to progress, instead of being shoved onto the next thing, that's a challenge,\u201d Coll said.\n\u201cAnd that's a challenge that comes because people who are not in the classroom are determining exactly what you should be doing over the course of a field of study or over the course of a week or over the course of how you simply teach reading. And that's not realistic, and it's especially not realistic, I think, with the current numbers (of students) we have.\u201d\nJanelle Brubach, taught middle school with Dastvan at General John Stricker. Brubach left the Baltimore County Public Schools system after 14 \u00bd years. She now sells houses as a Realtor for RE/MAX.\nBrubach said she was injured while attempting to separate a school fight in November 2021. Afterwards, she said, she began to suffer anxiety attacks associated with teaching. Ultimately, she said, her doctor refused to medically release her back to the classroom.\n\u201cEvery time I would go into the office, and we would talk about my return back into the classroom, I physically would break out in hives, and my neck would turn beet red at just the thought of going back,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe workload of teachers, especially through COVID was unbelievable, and it's just a thankless job,\u201d Brubach said. \u201cI was basically in charge of all the sixth grade discipline (before COVID). So, kids were being sent to my room yet I'm still expected to teach.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no support from administration for the amount of discipline I was handling and then parents were another level of cussing you out, and it's all your fault. And, you know, I just cracked.\n\u201cI absolutely love to teach, but I hate the job of a teacher.\u201d",

    "summary": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, higher education enrollment in the U.S., including Maryland, saw a significant drop, reversing the historical trend of increased enrollment during economic downturns. National undergraduate enrollment declined by 8% since 2019, with community colleges experiencing an even more dramatic decline.",
    "content": "Undergraduate and graduate enrollment in public four-year universities has decreased during the pandemic and community college enrollment has seen an even more dramatic decline. As the pandemic led to financial uncertainty across the country and caused colleges to make changes to class delivery, student life and other services, students were enrolling at lower rates. \n\n \n\nHistorically, times of economic hardship result in increased enrollment in higher education in America, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). At least since the 1980s recession, Maryland\u2019s public four-year institutions have generally followed this trend. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland and the rest of the country saw a drastic decline in higher education enrollment.\nDuring recessions, higher education enrollment generally increases as unemployment rates rise, according to the NBER. Teenagers and young adults especially gravitate toward college during economic hardship due to scarce employment opportunities. \n\n \n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the country\u2019s economy entered a recession and unemployment spiked. Unlike previous economic downturns, college enrollment also declined drastically as classes moved online and students and their families faced financial uncertainty.\nAccording to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (NSCRC), national undergraduate enrollment has seen an 8% drop since 2019. \nThe drop, however, is not out of the blue \u2014 college enrollment has been on the decline nationwide since 2011, according to NSCRC. Maryland\u2019s public four-year institutions deviated from this trend however; undergraduate enrollment only decreased two times between 2011 and 2019. In fact, 2014 saw a jump of over 9,000 undergraduate students. Graduate enrollment was on a very slight decline during that time. \nIn fall 2021, enrollment continued to decline. Unemployment dropped to pre-pandemic levels, and students started \u201cquestioning the value of college,\u201d said Doug Shapiro, the executive research director for NSCRC, in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\u201cThey may be looking at friends who graduated last year or the year before who didn\u2019t go, and they seem to be doing fine. They\u2019re working; their wages are up,\u201d he said.\nDespite an overall decline in enrollment in Maryland higher education, the changes varied among the state\u2019s public four-year institutions. \n\n \n\nWithin the University System of Maryland (USM), eight of the 11 universities saw a decline in undergraduate enrollment in the fall of 2020, and seven saw a decline the following year. \nWhile undergraduate enrollment fell only slightly in fall of 2020, it dropped 3.44% in fall 2021. USM graduate enrollment deviated from the national trend by decreasing both years; they dropped more significantly in fall 2020 but had a smaller decline in fall 2021. \nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), saw a significant difference between undergraduate and graduate enrollment: while the number of undergraduate students dropped both years, the number of graduate students went up. In fall of 2021, graduate enrollment increased by 9.28% \u2014 the biggest uptick out of the 11 graduate schools. \nUMBC Director of Communications and Content Strategy Dinah Winnick wrote in an email that \u201c[d]espite the complications from the worldwide pandemic,\u201d students are applying to graduate school programs in \u201crecord numbers.\u201d\nOther universities saw large declines in graduate enrollment. Salisbury University saw a 10.7% decline in graduate enrollment in 2021. Their undergraduate enrollment also fell, resulting in a 13% decrease overall since 2019. \nAllen Koehler, Salisbury University\u2019s Assistant Vice President of Enrollment Management, said that this was a big hit for Salisbury, especially considering the 2020 fall cohort was a highly anticipated class for the university.\n\u201cThe class that was for fall [2020], where COVID hit midway through the recruitment cycle, \u2026 was trending to be our largest class in over a decade,\u201d he said. \nCommunity colleges have faced even worse declines during the pandemic. The pandemic worsened an existing trend, where community college enrollment was on the decline for years. \n\n \n \nNationwide, community college enrollment dropped by 10% in 2020, according to NSCRC. In 2021, it continued dropping but at a slower rate. In Maryland, community colleges saw the inverse: enrollment dropped slightly (4.8%) in 2020, with a much steeper decline (9.8%) in 2021.\nAfter reaching a peak increase during the Great Recession, community colleges in Maryland began declining in 2012, which is in line with the national trend.\nAs the end of the 2021-22 school year approaches, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents will hold a meeting this month and discuss enrollment projections for the fall.",

    "summary": "A recent poll reveals that despite its 50-year history, Title IX remains largely unknown to most secondary school students and their parents, with significant disparities in awareness among different demographic groups. Despite this lack of knowledge, a majority of respondents support equal treatment for boys' and girls' sports teams, though many are hesitant to report potential violations of the law.",
    "content": "Title IX is 50 years old, but a poll has found that nearly three-quarters of secondary school students and nearly 60% of parents said they know \u201cnothing at all\u201d about the landmark civil rights law meant to ensure gender equity in education, including athletics.\nThe poll, conducted by Ipsos for The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland, found that parents and students overwhelmingly agreed that boys and girls teams should receive equal treatment. \nMore than 3.4 million girls and almost 4.6 million boys play high school sports.\n\nOnly a third of the people polled said they believe that equal opportunities exist in high school athletics across the U.S. But in their own schools, parents and students judged the situation to be much better, the poll found: About two-thirds said boys and girls had equal opportunities there.\nBeyond finding that a majority of parents lack knowledge of Title IX, the poll highlighted some differences among groups. Of male parents, 54% said they knew nothing about Title IX, compared to 62% of female parents. Nearly 80% of respondents with no college degree answered that they knew nothing about the law. That compared to 47% with a college degree.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nEnforcement of Title IX largely relies on students and parents to report unfair treatment or unequal athletic opportunities, but many poll respondents expressed reluctance to speak up about potential violations.\nIn response to the poll results, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary of the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education, said in a statement: \u201cWhile we have made tremendous progress, there is more work to do to build educational environments free from discrimination and to educate the public on how important this law is.\u201d\nMost parents polled did not know whether their children\u2019s school had a procedure for handling Title IX complaints.\nThe online poll of 1,008 parents and 506 children ages 12-17 now enrolled in school was conducted from March 18 to 28.\nUnder Title IX, all federally funded schools with athletics programs must provide equal opportunities and treatment in areas such as practice facilities, coaching and publicity. The majority of poll respondents answered \u201cunsure\u201d to questions that tested their knowledge about Title IX\u2019s application and enforcement, such as whether the law covers all educational programs that receive federal funding (it does) and who can report Title IX violations (anyone).\nParents who said their children played sports differed little from other parents in their knowledge of Title IX.\nAmong respondents who had some familiarity with Title IX, most said their knowledge came from sources other than school officials or materials. Half of parents who knew about Title IX said they saw, heard or read about it online.\nStudents were somewhat more likely than their parents to learn about Title IX from school personnel. One-third said they saw, heard or read about the law online and 29% said their information came from a school coach or official.\n\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing all aspects of Title IX. But its main enforcement mechanism relies on young athletes or their parents to know their rights, recognize violations and file a formal complaint with the federal agency. \nAbout half of students and parents agreed that it was their responsibility to report a Title IX violation if they were aware of one, but many said they were unlikely to or uncertain about speaking up to the relevant officials. \nOnly a quarter of parents said they would consider submitting a complaint to the federal Department of Education, while 38% said they likely would not consider it and 34% said they didn\u2019t know.\n\nParents were more likely to consider submitting a complaint to school personnel than to the federal government, but fewer than six in 10 parents said they would consider raising an issue with any kind of school official. A quarter of parents said they would not take any action if they witnessed a sports-related Title IX violation.\n\nParents who said they would be uncomfortable reporting a Title IX violation directly to their child\u2019s school were largely concerned about negative repercussions for their child, the poll found. For students, too, fear of retaliation at school and negative reactions from peers were the biggest causes of reluctance.\n\nView the University of Maryland/Ipsos \u2013 Title IX Poll:\nTopline\nCross tab 1\nCross tab 2\nCross tab 3",

    "summary": "The U.S. Department of Education's data on high school sports participation is unreliable and often overstates girls' involvement while ignoring some boys, making it difficult to assess Title IX compliance without complaints from athletes or parents.",
    "content": "As the agency responsible for enforcing Title IX, the U.S. Department of Education collects data that should show whether high schools are providing equal athletic opportunities to girls and boys. Except it doesn\u2019t.\nInstead, the data the department gathers from school districts ignores some athletes \u2014 mostly boys \u2014 and often overstates girls\u2019 participation in sports.\nAs a result, 50 years after the passage of Title IX, it\u2019s still impossible to tell whether high schools are complying with the law unless someone complains. That burden usually falls to teenage athletes and their parents, who often aren\u2019t aware of their rights under Title IX.\nIn a number of cases, figures collected by the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights are incomplete and differ substantially from statistics kept by school districts, an analysis by the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland shows.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nThe discrepancy seems to come largely from the office\u2019s narrow definition of sports participation. Officials at several Maryland school districts, for example, said they don\u2019t report complete counts of their athletes to the federal government because the survey asks only for a count of athletes on single-sex teams. Mixed teams \u2014 including football teams with one girl \u2014 are not included.\nIn an email response to the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 findings, a Department of Education spokesperson said the public should not use its data alone to draw conclusions about Title IX compliance. He also said the department uses its data \u201cin conjunction with other information and factors to investigate and enforce civil rights laws.\u201d\nElizabeth Kristen is project director and senior staff attorney at Fair Play for Girls in Sports, a project of Legal Aid at Work that provides legal services to low-income families. She said that in high school Title IX cases she litigated outside Maryland, she\u2019d seen that federal data didn\u2019t reflect on-the-ground disparities. But she never knew why.\nWhen told about the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 findings, Kristen called the Office for Civil Rights\u2019 exclusion of coed sports bizarre. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting accurate information to help them enforce Title IX if they\u2019re not collecting information about all of the athletic participants,\u201d she said.\nThe office\u2019s data comes from a survey that the agency describes as a \u201clongstanding and important aspect\u201d of administering and enforcing civil rights statutes. Under Title IX, schools are required to provide athletic opportunities in numbers that mirror each gender\u2019s proportion of enrollment.\nThe Povich and Howard centers analyzed athletics participation at the 20 Maryland public school districts that provided usable data and found that, in all but four cases, federal data describes a more favorable situation for female athletes than what the districts\u2019 own records show.\n\nIn fact, at about 40% of districts, federal data indicates that when compared to their proportion of enrollment, girls outnumber boys in sports. But schools\u2019 own data tells a different story: All districts have fewer opportunities for female athletes.\nIn the large suburban district of Baltimore County, for example, federal data paints a picture of sports fields teeming with female athletes. The Office for Civil Rights\u2019 public website says that, as of the 2017-18 school year, girls comprised 49% of enrollment in the district and 72% of athletes \u2014 making girls overrepresented in sports by 23 percentage points.\nBut the district\u2019s in-house athletics data, which the Povich and Howard centers obtained through a public records request, says that girls actually comprised 44% of athletes, meaning they were underrepresented in sports by about five percentage points.\nThat\u2019s one of several districts where the office\u2019s instructions to count only single-sex sports teams distort the image of proportionality.\nIn Calvert County, a district spokesperson said its 2017-18 federal data submission did not include football, golf, wrestling, baseball and tennis because those sports were coed. According to district data, that means 616 boys and 54 girls were not counted. Federal data suggests girls are overrepresented in sports by six percentage points, but district data shows they are underrepresented by the same amount.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting every athlete. Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u2014Peg Pennepacker, Title IX consultant and former high school athletics administrator\n\nWhen presented with the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 findings, Title IX advocates said they were puzzled and flummoxed by the federal government\u2019s exclusion of coed sports.\nPeg Pennepacker, a longtime athletics administrator who now consults with high schools on Title IX compliance, said that\u2019s not how she conducts athletics audits. \u201cI\u2019m counting every athlete,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nA change could be coming. Proposed revisions to the 2021-22 survey would remove the single-sex distinction from the federal data collection. But the shift would only apply to new data, and those numbers would not be public for a few years.\nIn the meantime, Terry Fromson, managing attorney for the Philadelphia-based Women\u2019s Law Project, said the available federal data isn\u2019t fulfilling its purpose. \u201cIt isn\u2019t making it easier for students or their families to find out if their children are being treated fairly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it should.\u201d\nSchools required to count, but only to count some\nSince 2000, the Office for Civil Rights has required K-12 schools to submit data on various programs, including athletics, through the Civil Rights Data Collection. The office describes the biennial data collection as part of its \u201coverall strategy for administering and enforcing\u201d civil rights laws such as Title IX. According to a Department of Education spokesperson, the office \u201cinitiated 12 investigations in the last decade based in part on CRDC athletics participation data.\u201d\nThe office also posts the data online, showing the gender breakdown of athletes side by side with enrollment percentages. The most recent data available is from the 2017-18 school year. (The latest data collection was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.)\nTitle IX advocates said that most students and parents don\u2019t know that they can check the office\u2019s data tool to see whether their schools are providing proportionate athletic opportunities. If they did, though, the Povich and Howard centers\u2019 analysis suggests that, in some cases, the data would not reflect equity gaps they see on their sports fields.\nThe Office for Civil Rights collects its data directly from schools, yet officials in many Maryland districts said they didn\u2019t know why the federal data doesn\u2019t match their own data. Those who had an explanation for the discrepancies pointed to the survey\u2019s instructions to only count single-sex athletics.\nRob Willoughby, supervisor of instruction and athletics at Caroline County Public Schools, was one of those officials. Last November, he logged into the submission system to complete the latest survey. As he scrolled, Willoughby had questions of his own.\nLike its predecessors since 2004, the 2020-21 Civil Rights Data Collection asked for the number of single-sex interscholastic sports at each school, the number of male and female teams and the number of female and male participants. The instructions said to \u201cInclude only interscholastic athletics in which only males or only females participate.\u201d\nWilloughby looked at the numbers for football. In the 2020-21 school year, no girls played on Caroline County\u2019s teams. But Willoughby had coached football during years when the roster included a girl. He was unsure whether to report the sport as single-sex or coed. \u201cIs it based on who actually participates?\u201d he wondered. \u201cOr the rules of who can participate?\u201d\nAccording to a 2020-21 data tip sheet for schools, when a girl participates on a predominantly male team, such as football or wrestling, the entire team should be excluded from the data. Since that can lead schools to exclude greater numbers of male athletes, it can result in the overall proportion of female athletes appearing higher than is the case.\nFor instance, if Caroline County\u2019s football players were omitted in the last data collection from 2017-18, it would mean that 135 boys \u2014 or 15% of the district\u2019s athletes \u2014 were not counted in the federal data.\nAdditionally, the exclusion of coed sports can mean that which teams get counted in a given district can change from survey to survey, since girls may participate in traditionally male sports one year and not others. That makes following trend lines difficult, Willoughby said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to me like they were collecting data to tell a story,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s difficult to know how school employees who complete the data collection interpret the single-sex athletics definition. Willoughby, who became athletics supervisor last year on top of another supervisory role, said that he tried clicking on a link in the instructions for more information about definitions, but it didn\u2019t work. He asked his director for guidance and tried Googling the subject.\nUltimately, he included football in Caroline County\u2019s 2020-21 totals since no girls had played that year. But he said it felt like a judgment call, and he didn\u2019t know if \u201cthe people who sat in this chair before me did it the same way.\u201d\n\nProposed changes in the count\nA fuller picture of athletic participation could be coming. In December, the Department of Education shared its proposed revisions for the next data collection, which would eliminate the single-sex athletics questions and ask schools for a tally of all male, female or nonbinary athletes.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Office for Civil Rights is aware of how the single-sex definition affected its past data. Documents in the Federal Register say that the proposed changes are intended \u201cto reduce the reporting burden on schools\u201d and lead to more accurate data on all athletes, \u201cregardless of gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what this all signals is just lost opportunity,\u201d\n\u2014Elizabeth Kristen, director, Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work\n\nKristen, the attorney who has litigated high school Title IX cases, said those revisions would be a positive step toward equipping schools and families to advance gender equity in sports. But she lamented that incomplete data has been the norm for so long. \u201cI think what this all signals is just lost opportunity,\u201d she said.\nKristen also said that the office could do more to educate schools and the public about the data. Pennepacker, the Title IX consultant who focuses on high school sports, agreed. She said the office could take its data \u201cand really turn it into something that could be very useful for schools and parents.\u201d\nBut school leaders might not appreciate a more complete view of high school sports participation being made public, Pennepacker said. \u201cTo be quite honest \u2026 I can see it being threatening to some schools, too, because it may expose inequities within their athletics program.\u201d\nOur original data analysis that produced facts included in this story is available for review in a data notebook.\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "content": "In Vista, California, heroes wear softball uniforms. Their names: Danielle Ellis and Sydney Prenatt.\nEllis and Prenatt resist such praise. But at Rancho Buena Vista High School, where the pair were teammates on the Longhorns softball team for four years before graduating in 2018, that\u2019s exactly how they\u2019re remembered.\n\u201cThey should absolutely be considered heroes. What they did was selfless and it\u2019s going to help so many girls in the future,\u201d said Ava Bradford, a former Rancho Buena Vista softball player.\nEllis\u2019 and Prenatt\u2019s story is rare. A four-month investigation of Title IX and high school sports by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found many high school girls lack the information to recognize Title IX violations and to demand change from school officials.\nNot Ellis and Prenatt.\nOn May 8, 2018, as teammates looked on, Ellis and Prenatt read a letter from the Vista Unified School District board. They learned that the board had approved a new softball field to be built on campus. They\u2019d won their fight for equal treatment.\n\u201cIt was a really powerful moment,\u201d Prenatt said. \u201cI almost started crying, just because it was really surreal.\u201d\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nThe senior softball players from the class of 2018 at Rancho Buena Vista High School stand with their coaches on the field. (Photo courtesy of Sydney Prenatt)\nAs seniors, the friends and teammates were students in a government class taught by Timothy Leary, a beloved figure at the school for 26 years. In the first unit of Leary\u2019s class, Ellis and Prenatt learned about the five concepts of democracy, specifically civil rights and the full extent of Title IX as it pertains to equal opportunity in sport. As they discussed the law and its purpose, a lightbulb went on about their softball field.\n\u201cSydney and I sat down and analyzed Title IX as a law. We\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this is a big deal. This is a very major issue,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe always noticed the differences and stuff, but we didn\u2019t realize that there was a law specifically that addressed that.\u201d\n\nWhat is Title IX?\nTitle IX is a federal law passed by Congress nearly 50 years ago. It prohibits sex-based discrimination at any school that receives funding from the federal government, including in sports programs. A four-month investigation by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland found that Title IX has fallen short of its promise for girls playing high school sports: They\u2019re stuck in an imperfect system that continues to favor boys in many ways.\n\nThere were many differences between the baseball field for boys and the softball field for girls. All favored the boys. The softball field was off campus at Buena Vista Park, where the girls played on the Buena Vista Ballfields about one-third mile from the school. The softball players also had to provide their own transportation, or walk.\nOther facilities were lacking. The field conditions were below average. The softball team\u2019s storage facilities did not match those for the baseball team. As a result, the players had to walk to their classes with their softball gear. The bathrooms at the park were also sometimes locked and there were instances when the athletes said they felt their privacy was being violated by passersby.\n\u201cIt just made us feel underappreciated and undervalued [by] the school,\u201d Ellis said.\nThe baseball diamond was far superior. It was on campus, had better field conditions, had a clubhouse to store gear, had access to the school bathrooms and had batting cages. The baseball team determined when it got to use the field.\nPrenatt explained that playing softball on a field in a public park owned by the city made it difficult to schedule games and practice, knowing other teams needed to use the field as well.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, it was so blatantly obvious, the unequalness,\u201d Prenatt said.\nAfter consulting with their government teacher, Ellis and Prenatt focused their yearlong class project on their softball field and Title IX. They approached the school principal in the fall to ask for help. He was not supportive, they said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when we knew that we had to go to the school board,\u201d Ellis said.\nRancho Buena Vista government teacher Timothy Leary stands in front of his classroom. (Lee Anne McCollough)\nEllis and Prenatt contacted members of the Vista Unified School District board, leading to a tense conversation with the principal, Ellis said. (Attempts to contact the principal, who has since left the school, were unsuccessful).\nThe girls faced other roadblocks. But Ellis and Prenatt were not going to let each other stop short of their goal.\n\u201c[Danielle] and I were both firing each other up and saying, \u2018No, why would we stop because it\u2019s so blatantly an obvious violation,\u2019\u201d Prenatt said. \u201cWe also knew the softball team deserves better and our coaches deserve better. That\u2019s why we weren\u2019t really super discouraged by not hearing [what we want].\u201d\nThey decided to go to a school board meeting on April 12, 2018, after their softball game against Ramona High School. They were dressed in their uniforms when they gave a speech about their proposal for a new field.\n\u201cWe are asking you to all stand with us so that future girls don\u2019t have to grow up thinking equality has to be earned,\u201d Prenatt said during their speech to the school board. \u201cThey grow up believing that equality is expected.\u201d\nOn Leary\u2019s advice, they then made an emphatic gesture to get the attention of the school board.\n\n\u201cIt was a really great moment, and it really made us feel seen and it made me really happy for the future softball players. \u2026 It was a really powerful moment. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\n\u2014Sydney Prenatt, former softball player, Rancho Buena Vista High School, Vista California\n\n\u201cBasically, [Leary] told us \u2018if you really want to make a statement, right after you give your speech you just walk out,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did, we walked out, and then our teammates, our parents, everybody stood up and just walked out with us.\u201d\nAbout four weeks after the school board meeting, Ellis and Prenatt got the letter with the big news that the district was going to build a new softball field for Rancho Buena Vista High School.\n\u201cWe read the letter to our entire team and we all started jumping around and screaming,\u201d Prenatt said. \u201cIt was a really great moment, and it really made us feel seen and it made me really happy for the future softball players. \u2026 It was a really powerful moment. I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new field at Rancho Buena Vista High School was held in February 2021. (Photo courtesy of Matt Doyle)\nThe new softball field, a part of Vista Unified\u2019s $247 million Measure LL Facility Bond Project, opened in February 2021. By then, Ellis and Prenatt had graduated.\nBut to Ellis and Prenatt, it was about the next generation of softball players having their own field to play on.\n\u201cThe goal was definitely just to get the girls coming after us a softball field on campus, something that was comparable to the baseball field,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThe biggest goal was just to do better by the next generation, to give them something more than we ever had.\u201d\nBradford, who was a freshman at the time of the school board meeting, was one of the softball players who got to play on the new field as a senior when it opened.\n\u201cWe have so much gratitude for what Sydney and [Danielle] did,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cJust to be able to have the opportunity to play on that field. I\u2019m just really grateful to have had my senior season there.\u201d\nEllis\u2019 and Prenatt\u2019s Title IX story lives on in Leary\u2019s government class when he teaches Title IX to his students.\n\u201cI use [Danielle] and Sydney in my class in my explanation every single year now,\u201d Leary said. \u201cWhat is so inspiring was that they were determined and this demonstrates what you can succeed and what you can achieve \u2026 when you don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "content": "If you\u2019d searched Pentucket Regional High School\u2019s Twitter account for school sports news five years ago, you\u2019d have come across many posts about the boys teams. Updates about the girls teams at the Massachusetts school were harder to find.\nFrom the beginning of the 2014-15 school year to early 2017, 26% of tweets from the school\u2019s athletics Twitter account covered girls team sports, according to an analysis by the region\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. When live game updates were tweeted, 60% of the updates were about boys teams and 32% were about girls teams.\nTitle IX requires equal opportunity for girls in school-based sports programs receiving federal financial assistance. That requirement extends to a category often overlooked by officials at many schools, including Pentucket Regional High School: publicity.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nPublicity covers a range of attention-grabbing promotion: social media, school news coverage, marquee announcements, pictures on the school athletics website, use of the cheerleaders and band \u2014 even trophies on display at the school.\nUnequal opportunities for publicity can vary widely. In Ball-Chatham Community Unit School District 5 in Chatham, Illinois, there were concerns over cheerleader and band attendance at boys and girls games. At Stephenville High School in Texas, the issue was equity in team nicknames.\n\n\u201cIf only male athletes are highlighted, girls get the message pretty quickly that they don\u2019t matter, that they\u2019re not as important, that their achievements are not valued.\u201d\n\u2014Elizabeth Kristen, director, Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work\n\n\u201cThis is really about the message of equality or inequality,\u201d said Elizabeth Kristen, director of the Gender Equity & LGBTQ Rights Program for Legal Aid at Work. \u201cIf only male athletes are highlighted, girls get the message pretty quickly that they don\u2019t matter, that they\u2019re not as important, that their achievements are not valued.\u201d\nFor students in Chatham, unequal opportunity for publicity meant girls teams had less access to school cheerleaders, the band and the dance team, factors that contributed to a Title IX complaint filed against the Ball-Chatham Community Unit School District 5 with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights in 2019.\nAccording to the complaint, the cheer team at Glenwood High School performed at each home and away game for varsity football, varsity boys basketball and junior varsity boys basketball in the 2018-19 school year. The cheerleaders at home varsity football and boys basketball games were joined by the dance team, which performed before and at halftime. The band performed at all home varsity football games and varsity boys basketball games.\nHowever, girls teams played without such support. According to the complaint, the cheerleading, dance team and band only played at one home varsity girls basketball game during the 2018-19 school year.\nAndrea Beckford, an attorney and author of \u201cWe Need Equal Cheers for Boys and Girls: How the Absence of Cheerleaders at Women\u2019s Sporting Events Is a Violation of Title IX,\u201dsaid we\u2019ve been conditioned to associate cheerleaders with sports like football.\n\u201cTheoretically, cheerleading is just supporting a sports team; it should not matter, the gender of said sports team,\u201d Beckford said.\nDusty Burk, athletics director and Title IX coordinator for the Ball-Chatham School District, said that since the civil rights complaint in 2019, the school district has taken steps to ensure the cheer and dance teams perform at every girls and boys junior varsity and varsity home basketball game starting in the 2021-22 season.\n\u201cWe believe our changes will improve the experience for all students involved in athletics and extracurricular activities, and remain committed to looking for future opportunities to enhance equities between the sexes,\u201d Burk said.\nPublicity disparities in social media are relatively easy to track. A 2017 civil rights complaint looked at social media at Pentucket Regional High School, located about an hour from Boston. That review covered approximately 5,000 tweets from the athletics department\u2019s Twitter account (then @SachemAthletics) from the start of the 2014-15 school year through February 2017.\nThe imbalance of tweets was just one factor that spurred an investigation of the Pentucket Regional School District for Title IX violations by the Office for Civil Rights. In 2017, the school agreed to address the problems.\nWhile some Title IX violations can put girls at risk of physical harm \u2013\u2013 poorly maintained fields, for example \u2013\u2013 unequal opportunities for publicity can send a message about what the school deems important, according to some former athletes.\nCara Hawkins-Jedlicka, an assistant professor at Washington State University, remembered running high school track in Tennessee feeling like girls teams had to reach an extreme to be recognized by her school, while the football team was celebrated even when it had a less-than-perfect season.\n\u201cI thought we had to do better to get coverage,\u201d Hawkins-Jedlicka said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a very harmful statement to give a teenager that \u2018you don\u2019t matter as much and if you do matter, it\u2019s only if you\u2019re winning.\u2019 \u2026 If you\u2019re not feeling important, and you\u2019re not feeling covered, if you\u2019re not feeling like this is useful, that\u2019s something that would probably push you to quit.\u201d\nAs of March 2022, the @SachemAthletics Twitter account no longer exists. Pentucket Regional High School\u2019s athletics director did not respond to requests for comment.\nSome violations of publicity are more subjective, like the use of mascots and nicknames for boys and girls teams.\nA civil rights complaint against Stephenville Independent School District in Texas included a statement about use of different mascots and nicknames for boys and girls teams.\nStephenville\u2019s boys teams are called the Yellow Jackets and the girls teams are referred to as the Honeybees. A 2015 resolution letter found that the different nicknames did not violate Title IX in regard to publicity. However, some Title IX advocates point out that using different nicknames for girls and boys teams can be problematic.\n\u201cNaming is really important and it sends a lot of important messages, so I would say that it is a violation of Title IX,\u201d said Kristen, who is also project director and senior staff attorney for Fair Play for Girls in Sports. \u201cI strongly feel that schools should not create these diminutive nicknames because it is definitely, to me, an indicator of female athletes being treated as lesser.\u201d\nWhile other Title IX violations often seem more egregious compared to equal publicity or use of the school band, providing equal opportunity for publicity is often inexpensive, Kristen said.\n\u201cThis is not like you have to build a new softball field. \u2026 This does not involve construction,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of this is free media, you know, putting out your own social media, on Twitter, on Instagram.\u201d\nStill, lack of publicity remains a reality for high school girls across the country, many of whom are unaware of their rights under Title IX.\n\u201cThis is a place where it\u2019s really easy for members of the school community, parents, coaches, grandparents, even just interested community members, to try and pay attention to what\u2019s happening at your local school,\u201d Kristen said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to just expect high school girls to take on all of that burden.\u201d\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "Pennsylvania passed a law in 2012 requiring public schools to report detailed data on sports programs to ensure gender equity, making it one of five states taking such action, while Congress has repeatedly failed to consider similar measures. Despite the passage of Title IX nearly 50 years ago, the federal government lacks an accurate method to assess compliance with the statute in K-12 schools.",
    "content": "When Pennsylvania state Sen. Mary Jo White met with frustrated players on a girls high school lacrosse team about a dozen years ago, she was dismayed by reports of the inferior treatment they were receiving. She wasn\u2019t surprised.\u00a0\nWhite, who played basketball at her all-girls high school, had already noticed girls across the state received less than boys as she watched her daughter play high school sports.\n\u201cYou could see they didn\u2019t get the training time,\u201d said White, who is now retired. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get the field time. They got it when the boys weren\u2019t using it. They were lucky if they had uniforms, or they just tried to cobble something together. It was not a friendly environment.\u201d\u00a0\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nMeanwhile, on the House side of the Pennsylvania legislature, Rep. Tim Briggs read a news article about parents concerned that their daughters were not being treated fairly in school sports.\u00a0\nAs the father of three girls, Briggs could identify with those concerns.\u00a0\u00a0\nSoon, Briggs, a House Democrat, and White, a Republican senator, championed a measure, passed in 2012, that requires public schools to report troves of data on their school programs \u2014 about who has the opportunity to play and what resources those athletes receive. The goal is to spot unequal treatment of female athletes.\n\u201cWe introduced it thinking it was a pretty common-sense thing,\u201d Briggs said.\nThat makes Pennsylvania one of at least five states that does what the federal government does not: collect in-depth data to measure Title IX compliance and gender equity in K-12 schools. Congress repeatedly has rejected or failed to consider such bills. The most recent failed attempt occurred in 2021.\nNearly 50 years after the passage of Title IX, the federal government still does not have an accurate way of knowing how many high schools and other secondary schools are in compliance with the statute, which requires equal opportunity despite gender, race or disability in education.\u00a0\nThe Office for Civil Rights collects participation data, but those figures can be incomplete and differ substantially from statistics kept by school districts, according to an analysis by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.\n Shep Melnick, professor of American politics at Boston College, said the gender-equity disparities in athletics are much more severe at the high school level than in collegiate sports.\n\u201cI think that the extent to which the Office for Civil Rights would focus more on high schools and less on colleges would be an extremely good idea because the disparities in high school are huge and just really serious,\u201d said Melnick, who has been analyzing Title IX compliance and the law\u2019s evolution.\nWhile college athletics departments have to report a detailed breakdown of participation by gender, the money they spend on scholarships, and other benefits for male and female athletes, K-12 schools don\u2019t face the same scrutiny.\nThe landmark legislation spurred increased participation by girls in high school sports, but Congress has resisted creating the same data reporting requirements that apply to college teams.\u00a0\nBriggs said trying to pass the bill wasn\u2019t easy in Pennsylvania because his counterparts and school districts complained about the burden of collecting and reporting the data. His Republican colleagues also attempted to cut back aspects of the legislation.\nMeanwhile in Washington, former Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and the late Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, were trying to pass a bill similar to the one in Pennsylvania, first introducing it in Congress in 2003.\nSince then, more than 100 members of Congress have co-sponsored legislation that would bring more transparency to high school sports. Every attempt failed in both chambers.\u00a0\nThe bills would have required K-12 schools to report data that shows how much funding their sports teams receive, how many games each team plays, the staff dedicated to each team and more.\nAdvocates for girls in sports, gender-equity researchers, lawyers and lawmakers are adamant that secondary schools \u2014 high schools in particular \u2014 are not complying with Title IX, and teenage girls are paying the price.\u00a0\n\u201cTitle IX is turning 50 in June, and we still estimate that the majority of schools are likely out of compliance with the law,\u201d said Sarah Axelson, vice president of advocacy at the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation. \u201cTransparency certainly wouldn\u2019t fix everything, but it certainly would have the potential to bring us closer and have more informed folks on the ground.\u201d\nSlaughter\u2019s and Snowe\u2019s bills, which would have required K-12 schools to report funding, dedicated personnel for their teams and other data, have been resurrected in both the House and Senate by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Doris Matsui, D-California. In 2018, they introduced the Patsy T. Mink and Louise M. Slaughter Gender Equity in Education Act. Since then, they\u2019ve reintroduced the bill twice \u2014 in 2019 and most recently in June 2021.\u00a0\nThe bills would require the Department of Education to establish an Office for Gender Equity and, like Slaughter\u2019s and Snowe\u2019s bills, would bring more transparency to high school athletics data. If passed, the office would assist schools in following Title IX requirements by creating a handbook and developing training programs.\nHirono declined requests for comment. Matsui did not respond to interview requests.\u00a0\nSlaughter introduced six versions of the bill. Snowe introduced complementary bills in the Senate in 2003, 2007, 2009 and 2011, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, introduced her own version in 2013. They all failed to get a hearing.\u00a0\nAdvocates for more stringent reporting said high school administrators are sometimes reluctant to support increased data reporting because of the burden it might place on athletics directors and principals.\u00a0\nBut school officials are collecting this information anyway, said Peg Pennepacker, a former high school athletics director who now is a consultant on Title IX issues.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of an athletic director\u2019s job. You should be monitoring yourself every single year. It\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\n\u2014Peg Pennepacker, Title IX consultant and former high school athletics director\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of an athletic director\u2019s job,\u201d Pennepacker said. \u201cYou should be monitoring yourself every single year. It\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\nTerri Lakowski, CEO of Active Policy Solutions and a former student-athlete, and other advocates said laws like the ones proposed by Snowe and Murray are essential for students, parents and Title IX lawyers.\n\u201cLaws like this can become so useful because they provide a tool and evidence as to what the school is really doing to comply with Title IX. They can help keep these schools honest when they\u2019re otherwise not being and not complying with Title IX\u2019s requirements,\u201d Lakowski said.\nThe difficulties preventing the bills from gaining momentum are indicative of the attitude toward gender equity in athletics, said Gloria Blackwell, CEO of the American Association of University Women. Blackwell likened the struggles to those faced by the Gender Equity in Education Act, which was first introduced in the 1990s and still hasn\u2019t passed despite multiple efforts by members of Congress.\n\u201cThe mere fact that we\u2019re still talking about something that was introduced initially 20 years ago is also pretty representative of the challenges that are still taking place around gender equity and in education,\u201d Blackwell said.\u00a0\nCongress isn\u2019t alone in its inaction, according to three-time Olympic gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar. She said Title IX advocates have shifted attention to fight other types of sex discrimination and sexual assault that fall under the statute.\n\u201cI think that there really has not been the political will, even by women\u2019s organizations, to make it happen. It just has not been high up enough on the list,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat women\u2019s groups have been doing is nowhere near enough to get it done.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nLakowski compared the lack of compliance in high school sports to speeding. Most people do it and only the extreme cases tend to get pulled over by the cops.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Office of Civil Rights is like the police who\u2019s going to pull you over if you\u2019re flagrantly violating Title IX or speeding 20 or 30 miles an hour over,\u201d Lakowski said. \u201cOtherwise, everything else is really incumbent upon the victim \u2014 the student, the athlete, the parent, or an advocate to speak up and stop them from speeding.\u201d \u00a0\nThe office collects participation data that details how many girls and boys are playing which sports and how many teams are offered to each gender by sport. While the data is collected from across the nation, advocates for girls in sports said the data doesn\u2019t provide an accurate picture of what Title IX compliance in that school or district looks like.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re asking high school students and their families, or 18- to 22-year-olds, college students, to be the ones to make sure that for generations to come that girls and women have equal opportunities,\u201d Hogshead-Makar said.\nTitle IX provides a clear roadmap as to what is required of high school athletics, said Ellen Zavian, attorney and law professor at The George Washington University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have a law to implement,\u201d said Zavian, who was a high school athlete.\u201cIt\u2019s that no one knows how to implement it \u2014 except a few experts.\u201d\nAdvocates such as Blackwell and Hogshead-Makar said enforcement of the statute through new legislation ought to be top of mind for lawmakers.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about protecting all students from sex discrimination, but it\u2019s also about ensuring that there\u2019s compliance with Title IX, because without compliance, without resources, it\u2019s just a law on the books that doesn\u2019t have any teeth,\u201d Blackwell said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long, arduous road,\u201d said Karissa Niehoff, executive director of the National Federation of State High School Associations and an advocate for federal action.\u00a0\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t use that excuse anymore,\u201d Niehoff added. \u201cWhy not? We\u2019re the United States, we\u2019re good at hard roads. And this is about our people. It\u2019s about our kids. It\u2019s about our society.\u201d \n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "content": "Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any education program or activity, including athletics, that receives federal financial assistance. However, the statute lacks a provision for formal education about Title IX for administrators, students and parents, though it does require districts to have Title IX coordinators to monitor compliance.\nThat means each school district crafts its own Title IX training \u2014 if the district offers any.\n\u201cIt was more of me learning [about Title IX] on the go and learning bits and pieces here and there, but I was never really taught about it until the issue came upon us,\u201d said Madyson Roach, a former softball player at Grant High School in Portland, Oregon.\n\n\u201cIf I was more educated, I could have used my voice more and advocated for change earlier than I started.\u201d\n\u2014Madyson Roach, former softball player at Grant High School, Portland, Oregon\n\n\u201cIf I was more educated, I could have used my voice more and advocated for change earlier than I started.\u201d\nFederal law does not mandate training in schools for Title IX and athletics. The only required training is on sexual harassment, according to Peg Pennepacker, founder of High School Title IX Consulting Services. That provision took effect in August 2020, about 48 years after Congress passed Title IX.\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nPatrick Nixon, the athletics director at Mergenthaler Vocational Technical High School in Baltimore, Maryland, is an example of a school staff member who does not have a solid understanding of a Title IX coordinator\u2019s role. Nixon said the district\u2019s Title IX coordinator has not stopped by Mergenthaler to evaluate the athletics department and provide feedback.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s supposed to be happening, but that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Nixon said.\nSome schools share their districts\u2019 training materials with community members. McHenry Community High School in McHenry, Illinois, has links to the training materials on its website, though the primary focus is on Title IX and sexual harassment.\nOn the 126-slide PowerPoint presentation used to train Title IX coordinators, the word \u201cathletics\u201d appears once, as one of nine areas that fall under Title IX.\nGrant High School in Portland, Oregon, where Roach went to school, provides a direct link to the Portland Public Schools website, which includes Title IX resources for students and parents.\nSome school administrations across the country are taking steps to educate themselves, their teachers and their coaches, along with students and parents, to ensure they can provide equal educational opportunities. However, school administrators must do their own research to find resources to provide a more thorough education.\nWhen the National Women\u2019s Law Center\u2019s Jayma Meyer, counsel at Simpson Thacher who does pro bono Title IX work, and her team approached Union City High School in New Jersey about its Title IX violations, the school was willing to make changes.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t realize what they needed to do, or even why. But now that we\u2019ve educated them, they really are committed to doing the right thing.\u201d\n\u2014Jayma Meyer, Title IX lawyer\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t realize what they needed to do, or even why,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cBut now that we\u2019ve educated them, they really are committed to doing the right thing.\u201d\nCharles Webster, director of grants and innovative programming at Union City High, underwent training to become a Title IX coordinator a few years ago, the first time he experienced such training.\nSince then, Webster has researched ways Union City High can update its Title IX education. The school is joining the Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA), which allows institutions to pick a Title IX curriculum it would like to focus on and provides workshops on specific topics.\n\u201cI came out and made the recommendation that we join ATIXA because it is, it is progress,\u201d Webster said. \u201cIt is an association that is relevant, that wants to remain relevant. And again, relevancy becomes the key.\u201d\nSome schools and districts have gone beyond basic Title IX education in other ways, especially with this year marking the 50th anniversary of the statute.\nIn Maryland, Amanda Twele, athletics director at John F. Kennedy High School in Silver Spring, established the Women in Sports Committee under Montgomery County\u2019s Athletics Unit in the summer of 2020.\nThe committee\u2019s first event in October 2020 highlighted Montgomery County public school graduates, and its second event in December 2020 had women share their involvement in athletics beyond playing a sport.\nThe committee held an event in February to celebrate the anniversary of the statute.\nUnion City also had aspirations to celebrate the milestone with a grand event at the high school. Union City decided not to wait until June and went ahead with its celebration conference in November 2021.\nIt held a five-hour event with speakers ranging from Meyer to Olympic athletes and coaches such as Sharrieffa Barksdale, Rose Monday, Marlene Harmon Wilcox and LaVonna Martin-Floreal, as well as a pediatrician and a guidance counselor with college recruiting expertise.\n\u201cI really enjoyed it,\u201d said Francisca Polanco, a senior member of both the softball and basketball teams at Union City High. \u201cI feel like I learned a lot with the presenters that came and spoke to us.\u201d\nEllen Zavian, a Title IX advocate, was the first female agent registered by the NFL Players Association.\nZavian wanted to play soccer when she went to high school in the late 1970s, a few years after the statute went into effect. But she was told she couldn\u2019t because there was only a boys team. So instead Zavian ran track, played volleyball and was a cheerleader, as those were options for girls.\n\u201cIf I had known about Title IX, I definitely would have filed a suit against my school when I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to play soccer,\u201d Zavian said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\nZavian said kids in school today know what Title IX is, which wasn\u2019t true when she was a student. Still, she said, students today are not taught how to use the law to their benefit.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still not empowered on how to utilize the law and execute it within their institution,\u201d Zavian said.\nThat\u2019s why some high school teachers, such as Timothy Leary from Rancho Buena Vista High School in California, are doing what they can to educate students so they can advocate for themselves.\nLeary teaches a social studies class, and during a lesson about Title IX a light bulb went off for two of his students. After learning about the statute, they approached the school board to advocate for an on-campus softball field and facilities that matched those of the baseball team. The students came out with a win, although not without some obstacles, and a new softball field opened in February 2021.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely just the importance and the relevancy to my students that just makes it such a great educational tool,\u201d Leary said. \u201cThey can relate to it. They need to learn it.\u201d\nJaelyn Watson, Tatyana Monnay, Colleen Neely, Iman Hassen and Ashkan Motamedi contributed to this reporting\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "Despite nearly 50 years since its enactment, Title IX has not fully achieved its goal of providing equal treatment in high school sports for girls, who often receive inferior resources and opportunities compared to boys. A recent investigation suggests that a significant number of schools remain non-compliant with the law, highlighting ongoing challenges in enforcing gender equity.",
    "content": "Title IX was designed in part to balance the scales for girls and boys in school-based athletics. Some day, maybe it will.\u00a0\nBut nearly 50 years after Congress passed the sweeping law that guarantees equity in\u00a0 \u201cany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d including high school athletics, girls are stuck in an imperfect system that continues to favor boys in many ways.\u00a0\nGirls\u2019 participation in school sports has increased dramatically since 1972. But Title IX advocates say that boys still get better treatment. Often, they say, boys teams are provided nicer uniforms, play on better fields, are led by more experienced coaches, have their practices scheduled at more desirable times (relegating girls teams to early mornings and late nights), play with newer equipment and dress in better-equipped locker rooms. All are potential violations of Title IX.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWe still estimate that the majority of schools are likely out of compliance with the law,\u201d said Sarah Axelson, vice president of advocacy at the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation.\nWhen girls see that they\u2019re getting worse treatment, their options include challenging their coach or principal, filing a lawsuit and lodging a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education \u2014 all daunting for a teenager. When parents step forward to report these situations, they\u2019re often at the center of disputes that can roil their child\u2019s high school. Not surprisingly, only a small percentage of likely violations end up being reported.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe still estimate that the majority of schools are likely out of compliance with the law.\u201d\n\u2014Sarah Axelson, vice president of advocacy, Women\u2019s Sports Foundation\n\n[ Read more stories from \u201cUnlevel Playing Fields\u201d ]\nA four-month investigation by The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland raises serious questions about the effectiveness of Title IX in the 23,882 public high schools across the U.S. It raises concerns about how many of the 3.4 million girls playing high school sports have experienced violations of Title IX that went unaddressed.\nAmong the findings:\n\u2022 Title IX isn\u2019t aggressively policed by state or federal government officials. It\u2019s mostly up to teenagers and their parents to report violations.\n\u2022 Most parents and students aren\u2019t well informed about the law. The federal government doesn\u2019t require schools to offer education about Title IX and athletics.\n\u2022 Reporting Title IX violations often means standing up to school officials like coaches and principals. That\u2019s a lot to ask of high school students and their parents.\n\u2022 Title IX enforcement protocols are cumbersome and slow-moving. A review of 39 complaints to the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights by the Povich and Howard centers showed that the average time from filing to resolution was nearly two years. That means girls who suffered unequal treatment often graduated before they saw results.\u00a0\nViolations reach girls across the country:\nIn Union City, New Jersey, a highly publicized athletics field that sits on the roof of a $180 million high school building was mostly used by boys teams. For nearly 10 years, access for girls was limited. \n\n\u201cMost of these athletes just presume that there must be a reason that they\u2019re getting second-class treatment. It\u2019s everywhere they look. They see that men are getting more than women everywhere. In high school, in junior high school, in college, men are getting more.\u201d\n\u2014Nancy Hogshead-Makar, three-time Olympic gold medalist and Title IX lawyer\n\nIn Ewa Beach, Hawaii, girls on the water polo team argued that they had to practice on dry land or in the open ocean before their season because they couldn\u2019t get funding for a pool.\nIn Ventura, California, girls on the softball team suffered injuries on a field that was poorly maintained, while the boys baseball team had a field that was better tended at a higher quality stadium.\n\u201cMost of these athletes just presume that there must be a reason that they\u2019re getting second-class treatment,\u201d three-time Olympic gold medalist Nancy Hogshead-Makar said. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere they look. They see that men are getting more than women everywhere. In high school, in junior high school, in college, men are getting more.\u201d\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Title IX has had a positive impact on girls and opportunities for them to play sports. Consider Title IX\u2019s impact on participation in high school sports. During the 1971-72 school year, girls made up about 7% of high school athletes in the country. For every girl playing on a high school team, there were more than 12 boys.\u00a0\nThrough the years, the participation gap steadily has narrowed. In a National Federation of State High School Associations survey of athletics participation in the 2018-19 school year, girls accounted for almost 43% of all high school players.\nBut the promise of Title IX has yet to be achieved.\u00a0\nEducation is lacking\nThe greatest challenge may be education. Teenagers and their parents first have to understand the law before they challenge school authorities.\nInterviews with dozens of parents and their children across the country by the Povich Center and Howard Center revealed a range of understanding of Title IX. Many high school athletes and their parents don\u2019t know that the law exists. Others said they\u2019d heard of the law but didn\u2019t know that protections applied to them.\nIn the late 1970s, Ellen Zavian \u2014 the first female agent licensed by the National Football League Players Association and a Title IX advocate \u2014 wanted to play soccer in high school. But she was told she wouldn\u2019t be able to because there was only a boys team.\u00a0\nSo Zavian ran track, played volleyball and cheered.\n\u201cIf I had known about Title IX, I definitely would have filed a suit against my school when I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to play soccer,\u201d Zavian said. \u201cBut, I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\nThat information gap still exists. Grace Saad, a former softball player at Buena High School in Ventura, California, didn\u2019t realize she could do anything when her teammates threw around the term \u201cTitle IX\u201d after noticing a clear disparity in how they were treated compared to their counterparts on the baseball team.\n\n\u201cI knew that things weren\u2019t equal, but I just thought that\u2019s the way it was.\u201d\n\u2014Grace Saad, former softball player, Buena High School, Ventura, California\n\nWhile the Buena High baseball team has a stadium, dugouts and a permanent outfield fence with a scoreboard, the softball team often didn\u2019t have enough softballs to hold batting and fielding practice at the same time.\n\u201cI knew that things weren\u2019t equal, but I just thought that\u2019s the way it was,\u201d said Saad, who graduated in 2020.\u00a0\nCourses and webinars in public schools could help inform students, coaches and administrators. But a federal education mandate like the one for parts of Title IX that refer to sexual assault doesn\u2019t apply to sports.\u00a0\u00a0\nDifficult choices for student, parents\nAt the beginning, someone notices a problem. It might fit into one of the two baskets of Title IX compliance \u2014\u00a0 \u201cparticipation\u201d or \u201ctreatment and benefits.\u201d\nParticipation applies to opportunities for girls to play sports as compared to the percentage of girls in a given high school, the proportionality test. If 60% of students in a high school are girls, approximately 60% of athletic opportunities should be for girls, according to Title IX.\u00a0\nTreatment and benefits refers to where girls play and what they play with, among other things. Title IX doesn\u2019t mandate that boys and girls teams have exactly the same of everything. It does require that they receive equal treatment in locker rooms, practice and game venues, scheduling of games and practices, publicity and coaching experience.\nAt Pentucket Regional High School in West Newbury, Massachusetts, the issue was Twitter. When the school tweeted live updates from its athletics account, 60% focused on boys teams compared to only 32% for girls teams. The Office of Civil Rights determined that the school would be required to monitor publicity efforts to ensure that any inequalities are corrected.\u00a0\nA person with a concern about any of these issues can report them to their high school. A meeting with a principal or athletics director might quickly settle the issue.\nWhen diplomacy fails, there are options in the courts and with the Office for Civil Rights.\u00a0\nUnder Title IX, the the office investigates complaints about sexual violence, treatment of pregnant students and treatment of LGBTQ students, as well as school-based sex discrimination in sports. When a person files a complaint, investigators contact the school, check out allegations and decide if violations have occurred. If they have, the civil rights office issues a resolution letter with steps the school must take to come into compliance.\nA Title IX lawsuit can be costly and time-consuming. Plaintiffs, even when they prevail, often emerge feeling bruised and exhausted.\u00a0\nIn Stillwater, Oklahoma, a group of softball parents filed a Title IX lawsuit against the local school district in August 2020. Ten months later, the parties reached a settlement\u00a0 that addressed many of the parents\u2019 concerns.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite an emotional toll. I think we\u2019ve all lost sleep over it,\u201d said Angela Morgan, a plaintiff in the case and president of the softball team booster club at Stillwater High School.\nEliminating Sex Discrimination\nTitle IX is rooted in the turbulent years of the 1950s and 1960s and the passions that fueled the civil rights movement. In those years, Congress debated laws designed to end racial discrimination in public accommodations, outlawing discrimination in hotels and at lunch counters. Later, its powers were expanded to end discrimination in hiring when companies received government contracts.\nTitle IX\u2019s purpose was to eliminate sex discrimination in education. \u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d Title IX states.\nAt the time, few lawmakers thought about the effect it might have on sports. The subject of sports came up only once during the Senate\u2019s months-long debate of the legislation\u00a0 \u2014 and that was no more than a passing exchange. Sen. Birch Bayh, a Democrat from Indiana and the bill\u2019s sponsor, told one of his Senate colleagues: \u201cI do not read [Title IX] as requiring integration \u2026 of the football fields,\u201d as recounted by author Welch Suggs in \u201cA Place on the Team: The Triumph and Tragedy of Title IX.\u201d\nDespite the profound impact the statute has had on girls and women in sports, those original 37 words included no references to athletics.\u00a0\nNearly 50 years later, Title IX and opportunity for girls in sports are nearly synonymous. The gains made by high school girls over the decades have been significant, but boys often still get better treatment.\nWhen the state-of-the-art, rooftop athletics field was unveiled in 2009 in Union City, New Jersey, it quickly gained national attention for its innovative design. The boys football team played on it for nearly a decade; use by girls teams was restricted.\u00a0\nThe National Women\u2019s Law Center pointed out the problem to Union City High School, and the administration made changes.\nToday, girls teams share the field with boys, using it extensively for their practices and games. In fact, Union City High School is in many ways a model for gender equity in sports.\nIt\u2019s a reminder that Title IX can be monitored and aggressively enforced. But for 50 years it hasn\u2019t been.\n\nThe Newsroom Where It Happens\nSupport Student Journalism\nDonate",

    "summary": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, public school enrollment in Maryland decreased by 2.96% in the fall of 2020, with a further 0.12% decline in the following year, while homeschooling rates saw an unprecedented 53.6% increase.",
    "content": "As a grassroots, volunteer-based organization that connects homeschoolers across the state, the Maryland Homeschool Association (MDHSA) has been tracking data collected by the state education department on homeschooling rates for nearly 20 years. It always tended to fluctuate seemingly randomly, said founder Alessa Keener, never changing by more than 9%.\n\u201cSome years, it goes down. Some years, it goes up,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s never really been, I think, a good explanation [as to] why.\u201d\nBut in the spring of 2020, the face of education changed drastically throughout the United States as the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the country. The MDHSA anticipated increasing numbers of homeschooling parents, but the 53.6% increase that came was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Keener said.\nThe change MDHSA noticed was a result of a national trend: parents were pulling their children from public schools as the pandemic persisted. After a slight increase in enrollment in the fall of 2019, the nation experienced an approximate 2.64% decrease in public enrollment in the fall of 2020, according to data from each state\u2019s education department.\n\n\u00a0\nAnd Maryland was no exception: the state saw an overall 2.96% decrease in Pre-K through 12 enrollment, according to state education department data. While all counties individually saw a decrease, how much of a drop varied by county.\nAlthough statewide enrollment declined even further between fall 2020 and fall 2021, the decrease was by 0.12%, a much smaller decline than from the first year of the pandemic.\n\n\u00a0\nWhile the majority of counties saw enrollment increase after the first year of the pandemic, seven counties and Baltimore City experienced a further decline in enrollment in the 2021-22 school year.\nMaryland is one of 10 states that, overall, experienced a further decline in enrollment the 2021-22 school year, based on data from the 30 states that have that year\u2019s data available.\n\n\u00a0\nAs schools across the state \u2014 and country \u2014 switched to virtual learning during the spring 2020 semester, many parents grew dissatisfied with their children\u2019s education quality, according to Keener. She said the state saw a wave of what the association calls \u201cpandemic homeschoolers.\u201d\n\u201cThe schools really tried to do their best,\u201d she said. \u201c[Parents] just felt like what the schools were attempting to do was just more frustrating than it was beneficial.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nMaryland reached over 42,600 homeschooled students in the 2020-21 school year after never topping 28,000 since at least 2003, according to data from the state education department. This followed a nationwide trend based on the Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey, whose data showed nearly all states experienced an increase in homeschooling rates at the beginning of the 2020-21 school year.\nThe \u201cpandemic homeschoolers\u201d came in two major waves, Keener said, differing in their reasons for pulling their children out of schools.\nThe first wave pulled their children to officially homeschool either that spring or for the upcoming school year, often with the mindset that it would be temporary \u2014 just to \u201cget through\u201d the year, Keener said. Some of these families were concerned about the negative impacts constant computer screen time would have on their children, and others \u2014 including parents of children with ADHD or a learning disability \u2014 found their children could not stay engaged with their virtual classes.\nOther families, Keener said, had already been considering homeschooling their children, and the pandemic gave them the push they needed.\nCOVID-19-related anxiety also played a role, she said, and still currently keeps some parents from sending their children back to schools \u2014 sometimes because the child or a family member is high-risk.\nThe second wave of homeschoolers, she said, came later on into the pandemic as schools started returning to in-person instruction. These parents were more driven by \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons, she said, concerned about mask mandates and possible vaccine mandates for students.\nMany parents also turned to private schools during the pandemic, and, as a result, private school enrollment increased.\n\u201cOur independent schools were able to pivot quickly to remote learning, and then to hybrid learning, and then back to in-person learning with [COVID-19] mitigation strategies in place,\u201d according to Peter Baily, executive director of the Association of Independent Maryland & DC Schools, which currently represents 121 independent schools.\nIn addition, these schools \u201cquickly allocated financial resources\u201d to fund additional programs during the pandemic, according to Baily.\n\n\u00a0\nReports from the Maryland State Department of Education on nonpublic enrollment stated that the pandemic led to temporary closures for some private schools. While the number of traditional private schools tallied in the report increased during the pandemic, the number of church-exempt private schools decreased.\nSome counties, such as Queen Anne\u2019s and Frederick counties, anticipate that public school enrollment will increase in the upcoming 2022-23 school year as the schools return to relative normalcy.\n\u201cWe found that many of the families came back to us when we started offering in-person learning once again,\u201d said Frederick County Public Schools Communications Manager Brandon Oland.\nAnd Keener agrees. She expects homeschooling rates to drop looking forward. However, she does not believe homeschooling will return to pre-pandemic rates.\n\u201cI think traditional brick and mortar families are anxious to get back to their usual educational normalcy with their kids,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] there\u2019s going to be some families who will say, \u2018This was an interesting experiment, and, surprisingly, it\u2019s worked for my family.\u2019 So I think they will continue.\u201d",

These changes come after President Biden criticized the previous policies during his campaign and signed an executive order in 2021 directing a review of existing regulations.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Biden administration is expected to propose new rules this spring aimed at reversing the controversial Trump administration regulations governing the rights of those accused of sexual misconduct in colleges and schools.\nThen-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in 2017 set off a firestorm over new rules under Title IX that gave additional legal protections to accused offenders.\nThe Trump White House contended that colleges and universities \u201chave often stacked the deck against the accused, failing to offer protections such as a presumption of innocence or adequate ability to rebut allegations.\u201d But critics denounced the shift, saying the new policies could lead to courtroom-like hearings where accusers could be cross-examined over their credibility. Some observers said the changes would lead to scores of lawsuits.\u00a0\nPresident Joe Biden was critical of the regulations during his presidential campaign, saying that \u201csurvivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced,\u201d and he promised he would put a \u201cquick end\u201d to it if he was elected.\nBiden signed an executive order on March 8, 2021, instructing the education secretary to review existing regulations \u201cas soon as practicable, and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.\u201d\nThe Department of Education confirmed to Capital News Service that the notice is expected in the spring and \u201cwill provide the public an opportunity to comment and will precede the issuance of a final rule.\u201d\nThe new policies are also expected to create additional protections for LGBTQ+ students, according to Biden\u2019s executive order.\nTitle IX, a federal civil rights law passed in 1972, prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or educational settings that receive funding from the federal government.\nIn 2018, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, was one of many members of Congress to speak out against the regulations implemented by the Trump administration, saying that DeVos was \u201con the side of those accused rather than the victims.\u201d DeLauro said she worried that her proposed rules would \u201cremove policies that hold perpetrators accountable and help ensure schools are maintaining a safe environment for their students.\u201d\nFour years later, DeLauro said she is looking forward to the release of new rules.\n\u201cI am encouraged by the Biden administration\u2019s plans to undo the previous administration\u2019s harmful, unjust Title IX policies,\u201d DeLauro told CNS. \u201cThrough the rulemaking process, revisions to enforcement, and updates to case processing, the Department of Education must restore critical protections for student survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment.\u201d\nMajor educational organizations including the National Education Association (NEA) have spoken out against DeVos\u2019 regulations. In a 2018 statement, NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said that the \u201cTrump-DeVos agenda would return schools to a time when rape, assault, and harassment were swept under the rug.\u201d\nRep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, supported the Trump administration regulations. She argued in a statement a year ago that it took DeVos nearly three years to get the Title IX changes \u201cright.\u201d\u00a0\nFoxx opposed Biden\u2019s executive order.\n\u201cThe right to due process is bigger than partisan politics \u2013 it is a cornerstone of American democracy,\u201d the congresswoman said in a March 2021 statement. \u201cBy overturning these stakeholder-vetted, court-supported rules, key protections for victims and the due process rights of the accused would be jeopardized.\u201d\nIt\u2019s On Us, a national sexual assault prevention organization, along with other similar groups, created the #EdActNow campaign to petition the Department of Education to issue proposed changes as early as October 2021, and until then, to not enforce the Devos rule.\u00a0\nHowever, the 2020 regulations are still in place and will be in effect until new rules are passed by the Department of Education.\nTracey Vitchers, executive director of It\u2019s On Us, said she was upset when the Department of Education was not able to meet the October deadline. She told CNS she believes part of the reason lies with the Senate delaying the confirmation of Catherine Lhamon, narrowly confirmed last October as the Education Department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights.\u00a0\nLhamon served as assistant secretary under the Obama administration and worked on guidance that created protections for transgender students in schools and set out how schools should investigate Title IX claims. These were among the guidelines repealed by the Trump administration.\u00a0\nVitchers said she hopes that the Biden administration puts forward a rule that takes into consideration how traumatic sexual violence can be for survivors and that will emphasize reporting and holding accountable schools that have \u201ca culture of violence on campus.\u201d\n\u201cI also am hopeful that them taking the amount of additional time that they have results in a stronger rule, results in a rule change that is effective, is supportive of student safety and survivor rights,\u201d she said.\nVitchers said she has seen the harm that the existing regulations have caused. She specifically highlighted \u201cequity issues\u201d within the reporting process, including how schools are prevented from taking anything seen as disciplinary action on students who are accused of sexual misconduct until they have gone through the full \u201cinvestigative and adjudicated process.\u201d\n\u201cStudent survivors on campus are like, \u2018Well, why is so-and-so, who we know has been accused of sexual assault, still playing the football game on Saturday?\u2019 It\u2019s because the investigation has not been completed,\u201d Vitchers said. \u201cThe coach\u2019s hands are tied because prohibiting that student from competition because of the allegations of sexual assault could be interpreted as unwarranted disciplinary action that violates the accused student\u2019s rights.\u201d\u00a0\nVichers also highlighted the inequities within the live cross-examination process at Title IX hearings that the 2020 rules laid out.\u00a0\nAdvocacy groups and individuals sued the Department of Education over the 2020 rules, claiming that the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. While the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts upheld most of the rules put in effect under DeVos, the court invalidated one part that prohibited \u201cdecision-makers in Title IX proceedings\u201d from \u201cconsidering any \u2018statement\u2019 from a person who did not submit to cross-examination at the live hearing.\u201d\nThe court called the provision \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and underscored how respondents could schedule live hearings at inconvenient times or talk witnesses out of attending hearings and \u201crest easy knowing that the school could not subpoena other witnesses to appear.\u201d\nAs of August 24, 2021, the Department of Education has not enforced parts of the rules that the court vacated. However, all other provisions put in place by the Trump Administration remain in effect until new rules are announced.\u00a0\nBackers of the Trump rules are not eager to see major changes.\u00a0\nThe 2020 regulations brought \u201cbalance to campus proceedings\u201d by including procedural protections for accused students, according to Joe Cohn, the legislative & policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). FIRE is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that advocates for\u00a0student and faculty individual rights at colleges and universities.\n\u201cThe 2020 regulations were extremely helpful\u2026because prior to the regulations, there were minimal if any rights for accused students that were required by the federal government,\u201d Cohn told CNS. \u201cThe only way to secure particular due process proceedings was to sue after the fact when basic procedural protections were skipped.\u201d\nData on the impact of the regulations isn\u2019t widely available yet due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Cohn.\u00a0\n\u201cFor most of 2020 and 2021 schools were remote,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cSo data on decreased or increased reports is unreliable because there were too many other variables to really draw any conclusions from.\u201d\nCohn said he hopes that the new regulations will constitute modest changes.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to work with this administration if they\u2019re really serious about having a policy that respects the rights of all students,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope they go that route instead of deciding to just play ping pong with Title IX policy.\u201d\nVitchers said she also recognized that Title IX regulations regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment have turned into a political back-and-forth. Since 2011, the regulations have been rewritten multiple times and have generated campaign promises to undo or redo specific provisions, by the administrations of Barack Obama, Trump and now Biden.\u00a0\n\u201cSexual assault does not care if you are a Democrat or Republican\u2026so the fact that Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration turned it into this political issue that it never should have been, was really harmful,\u201d Vitchers said. \u201cMy hope is that with the rule change, we will return to a rule that is fundamentally grounded in upholding students\u2019 civil rights and campus safety at large because that\u2019s what Title IX is about.\u201d",

    "content": "Around 7% of the students at Somerset County Public Schools (SCPS) have tested positive for COVID-19 since August 2021. Some public schools in Somerset, like Crisfield Academy and High School, have rates of cumulative positive cases higher than 9%.\u00a0\nSchools across Maryland have had varying rates of positive COVID-19 cases since the start of the 2021-2022 school year. Some counties, like Somerset, have had particularly high rates of total positive cases within their schools in comparison to their respective school populations.\u00a0\n\u201cOur case rates are alarming and we devote a significant amount of staff resources to manage our contact tracing as a result,\u201d SCPS Public Relations Specialist Victoria Miele stated in an email. \u201cWe are also hiring additional staff through a grant that we were recently awarded through the health department to manage the daily workload and relationship with our health department.\u201d\nCrisfield Academy and High School has the highest positivity rate among students in SCPS. Over 9% of the overall student population tested positive for the virus since August.\n\nIncluding Crisfield, three out of the nine schools in the county have had over 7% of the student population test positive in the four months since public schools returned to in-person instruction.\u00a0\nThe other two schools, Somerset Intermediate Elementary School and Carter G. Woodson Elementary School, have both had nearly 8% of the school population test positive.\u00a0\nThis trend is maintained when positive staff COVID-19 cases are included with the students. Schools that had high numbers of student cases have also seen high numbers of staff cases.\n\nSomerset County has the lowest vaccination rate of all Eastern Shore counties in Maryland, with 46% of the county\u2019s population fully vaccinated, compared to the 67% overall vaccination rate for Maryland, according to the New York Times COVID Dashboard.\u00a0\nWith the recent approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 and efforts underway to vaccinate children in Maryland, some county school systems, like Montgomery County, Baltimore County and Howard County, have encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated.\u00a0\nHowever, SCPS has taken a different stance.\n\u201cThe Somerset Board of Education is neutral regarding student vaccination. The belief is that it is the parent's choice to make medical decisions for their child, not the school district,\u201d Miele wrote.\u00a0\nAccording to Miele, Somerset County Health Department has set up make-shift vaccine clinics for the 12 to 17 age group in their schools in the past. Miele stated that the school has done the same for the 5 to 11 age group.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have given space in our elementary schools this month for the Somerset Health Dept to conduct vaccine clinics for this age group, however this is a health dept initiative, not a SCPS initiative.\u201d\nThere are four total vaccination clinics in Somerset, according to the Maryland Coronavirus Vaccination Clinic page and Somerset County Health Department. Somerset is among four counties on the Eastern Shore with the highest numbers of residents per clinic. Somerset has a population of 25,616 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 6,404 people for each clinic. The other three counties, Cecil, Caroline and Queen Anne\u2019s, range from around 6,700 to around 7,350 people per clinic.\u00a0\nThe other five counties on the Eastern Shore range from about 3,000 to about 5,750 people per clinic.\u00a0\nSomerset County had the highest poverty rate of any Eastern Shore county in 2019 with 23.6%, according to the 2019 U.S. Census. The rest of the counties\u2019 poverty rates on the Eastern Shore range from 6% to 16%.\n\n \n\u201cWe are also extremely rural (the county population is about 26,000), and such a large percentage of our students live below the poverty line that we receive the majority of our funding from the state and all students receive free school meals. We also know that higher rates of Covid exist among underserved populations for a variety of documented reasons,\u201d Miele said.\nLess affluent populations are more at risk of COVID-19 because of pre-existing illnesses, like heart and respiratory conditions, that are more common among this group, according to the Brookings Institution. Additionally, the ability to practice social distancing and to work from home are less likely.\nThe lack of reliable internet services also affects the ability to quickly pivot to online learning, according to Miele.\n\u201cSomerset County cannot just flip to virtual instruction when rates go up like some other districts can. We also lack reliable internet throughout the county. And many services to these underserved students can\u2019t be delivered remotely. It\u2019s been a very challenging few school years, to say the least,\u201d Miele said.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are wide gaps by income class in both the risk posed by the virus, because of existing health conditions, and in levels of response to the risk of infection.\u201d\nSomerset has the highest population of Black people, about 41.5%, among the Eastern Shore counties, according to the 2019 U.S. Census.\u00a0\n\n \nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, data throughout the pandemic showed that marginalized groups, mainly Black and Hispanic/Latino people, are hospitalized and have died from COVID-19 at higher rates than people who are white and non-Hispanic.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014\u00a0A new superintendent is being hired to help manage Maryland\u2019s schools for troubled youth, starting in January.\nThe Juvenile Services Education Program, which Gov. Larry Hogan, R, signed into law in July, has started the scouting process for a new superintendent, who will be in charge of managing the education of all children in the state\u2019s juvenile treatment facilities.\n\u201cHiring a Superintendent is one of the most important jobs placed upon the (Juvenile Service Education Program) board\u201d Grace Reusing, chair of the board,\u00a0 said in a Sept. 27 press release.\u00a0\nIn the same release, Reusing added, \u201cwe are in the process of a rigorous national search and plan to have the new superintendent in place by January 2022.\u201d\nReusing told Capital News Service that the superintendent will address issues involving teacher pay and retention. Although whoever fills the position will not have the power to raise wages, they will be able to propose these changes to the Legislature.\u00a0\nOne of the biggest challenges the facilities are having, according to Reusing, is keeping teachers employed. She said this is due to the fact that they aren\u2019t getting paid as much as they would in a community school and they are working all year round.\u00a0\nLikewise, students are transferring in and out of the facilities all year. Reusing said the new superintendent will help implement a more career-driven curriculum for students, who currently receive six hours of education a day.\u00a0\nCurrently, the Juvenile Services Education Program\u2019s schools teach about 3,500 15- to 18-year-old students per year. The Maryland Department of Juvenile Services runs 12 detention and residential treatment centers across the state and a school operates on each campus.\u00a0\nThe job description, posted on the state of Maryland\u2019s job openings website, states that \u201cthe Superintendent of JSEP will champion equitable, high quality, holistic and individualized education for a unique student population, identify metrics and communicate high expectations for JSEP, and drive related transformation efforts.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to the press release announcing the start of recruitment, the job will be open for applications until the end of October.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education will transition their educational services to the Juvenile Services Education Program starting on July 1, 2022.\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

    "content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 Maryland schools are gearing up for potential Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds.\nMohammed Choudhury, Maryland state superintendent of schools, told Capital News Service in an email that the vaccine is the best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cThe expansion of vaccine administration to younger children will help prevent school outbreaks, reduce the numbers of students and staff in quarantine, and continue to keep students and staff in classrooms for full-time in-person learning,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBaltimore County Public Schools will be thrilled when vaccines are authorized and available for all students,\u201d spokesman Charles Herndon told CNS. \u201cThey are the best way of keeping children and staff in our schools safe and COVID free.\u201d\nPfizer and BioNTech announced Sept. 20 that a smaller dose of their vaccine was safe and had \u201crobust neutralizing antibody responses\u201d among the 5- to 11-year-olds in their trial.\u00a0\nThe FDA said Friday that it set a vaccines advisory committee for Oct. 26 in anticipation of Pfizer\u2019s request for the vaccine\u2019s authorization.\n\u201cWe are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children,\u201d Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe weekly rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 children and adolescents was nearly five times higher in mid-August than in late June, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nDr. Milagritos D. Tapia, a pediatrics professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the vaccine \u201cwill decrease transmission in schools, and would \u2026 decrease the opportunity for children to become severely ill or experience the (after effects) of COVID infections, which do occur in children.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Maryland Health Department recognizes vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds \u201cwould be an important peace of mind for parents,\u201d agency spokesman Andrew Owen said in an email to CNS. He added that the department is working with local jurisdictions and school systems to prepare for the vaccine\u2019s approval.\u00a0\nDana Smith, a parent of an 11-year-old student at Arbutus Middle School in Baltimore County, described the start of the school year as \u201cnerve-wracking with the local positivity rate being up and the community spread bouncing between substantial and high,\u201d she told CNS via Facebook Messenger.\nSmith said her heart skips a beat each time the school sends COVID-19 case notifications because she wonders if the students who contracted the virus were in any of her son\u2019s classes.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to the vaccine being approved for kids, and I plan to have my son vaccinated as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\nCOVID-19 last month hit elementary schools in the Baltimore County Public Schools system harder than the high schools and middle schools. Nearly half of the 240 positive cases it reported from Sept. 10 to Sept. 17 were from elementary schools, according to the school system.\u00a0\nTwo weeks later, from Sept. 24 to Oct. 1, the reported positive cases in Baltimore County\u2019s schools weren\u2019t much better. Out of the 214 reported infections, 104 were from elementary schools.\u00a0\nThe Baltimore County Public Schools system is the third largest in Maryland. Herndon said Baltimore County has a high level of COVID-19 community transmission under CDC criteria.\nHe said having the vaccine authorized for younger children would be a big step toward lowering the school system\u2019s infection rates and making everyone safer.\nHoward County Public School System Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano said he\u2019s a very strong proponent of younger students being vaccinated, citing their vulnerability to the virus.\nTo keep students and staff safe, the school system engages in constant communication encouraging vaccinations, he said.\u00a0\n\u201cKeeping this in front of everybody is absolutely critical as we try to maintain the health and well being of our students and staff and keep schools open,\u201d Martirano said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main goal.\u201d\nThe Howard County Health Department is working closely with county school officials to determine how to best provide COVID-19 vaccinations for 5- to 11-year-olds once authorization is given, Dr. Kelly Russo, the department\u2019s medical director, said in an email.\u00a0\nSchool systems across Maryland are making similar preparations ahead of the FDA\u2019s authorization.\u00a0\nThe Anne Arundel County Public Schools system worked with the local health department during the summer to hold vaccination clinics for students and staff, spokesperson Bob Mosier said in an email.\u00a0\nRecently, they have been having conversations about the logistics of providing vaccination clinics if and when they become available for 5- to 11-year-olds, he said.\nFrederick County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Theresa Alban said in an email that the school system and the local health department also are discussing options for offering vaccination clinics.\nThe Baltimore City Public Schools system told CNS in an email that once the vaccine is fully approved, it will continue its partnership with the local health department to ensure vaccines get to students.\u00a0\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona told U.S. News & World Report that it \u201cwould be a game changer\u201d for elementary-aged students to be eligible for vaccinations.\nThe anticipated authorization of the vaccine for children comes amid a renewed push from some Maryland lawmakers to mandate vaccinations for public schools statewide.\n\u201cA requirement for students to be able to be vaccinated for Covid as they enter our schools is another tool we should be considering as a state,\u201d state Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, said in an interview with CNS.\u00a0\nGov. Larry Hogan, R, rejected calls for implementing statewide mandates in a press conference on Sept. 30.\u00a0\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve done so many (vaccinations) we haven\u2019t found the need for it,\u201d he said.\nCalifornia recently announced plans to institute a vaccine mandate in public schools once the FDA fully approves the vaccine for all school-age children, the first state in the country to do so.\nTapia said she recommends Maryland schools encourage families to vaccinate their 5- to 11-year-olds if the FDA authorizes the vaccine for them.\n\u201cI think that there will be concerns, just because there (are) always concerns,\u201d Tapia said.\n\u201cBut if they\u2019re concerned, what they should be more concerned about is their risk of having an infection, and the outcomes of that infection for the child, rather than the risk of having side effects from the vaccines,\u201d she said, referring to data from people aged 16-25 having worse reactions to COVID-19 than the vaccines.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cSo it\u2019s a safer bet to be vaccinated than to be infected with COVID,\u201d Tapia said.\n(Capital News Service Annapolis Bureau reporter Alex Argiris contributed to this story.)\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 The nominating committee for an education reform panel has not reopened applications, despite Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s urgent request on Sept. 10 for more diverse nominees.\nGov. Hogan\u2019s letter requested the committee to \u201cimmediately reopen the application process and provide a slate of nominees that accurately reflect our student population.\u201d\nThe education reform panel, also known as the Accountability and Implementation Board for Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, will monitor the implementation of new multi-billion dollar investments in Maryland schools beginning in 2022.\nThe panel\u2019s current nominees do not represent Latino communities, the Eastern Shore, Western Maryland or any other rural jurisdictions, the governor said.\nIn response to Hogan\u2019s request to reopen applications, the committee is waiting for the Maryland attorney general to provide clarity, according to Dr. Shanaysha Sauls, chair of the nominating committee.\n\u201cWe need to get advice from the attorney general\u2019s office. We\u2019re getting legal advice about the options,\u201d Sauls told Capital News Service.\nThe law requires Hogan to select seven nominees by Oct. 1 from the nominating committee\u2019s list, which must include a minimum of nine people.\nThe committee, which reviewed 43 total applications, submitted nine candidates \u2014 four who identify as white, four as Black and one as Asian \u2014 on Sept. 1.\nRegarding the selection, \u201cWe thought it was diverse across a number of different dimensions: race, age and perspective,\u201d Sauls said, and the governor\u2019s letter \u201ccame as a surprise.\u201d\nThe nominating committee selected nine candidates for the Blueprint legislation\u2019s Accountability and Implementation Board: Mara Doss, Fagan Harris, William Kirwan, Isaiah Leggett, Jennifer Lynch, Joseph Manko, Harry Preston, Laura Stapleton and Joshua Starr. (Courtesy Sept. 1 press release from the Accountability and Implementation Board Nominating Committee)\nCrucial to the passage of the education reform bill was the creation of a \u201cstrong accountability system\u201d to oversee the implementation of the legislation.\nThe seven-member panel will be tasked with that responsibility, as well as with holding school systems accountable for student outcomes.\nThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, which became law in February after the state Legislature overrode Hogan\u2019s 2020 veto, is a wide-ranging bill.\nIt represents a sweeping overhaul of Maryland\u2019s education system, with measures such as higher teacher salaries, expanded access to pre-K and greater support for English learners.\n\u201cWithout adequate representation on the (panel), it will be difficult to sufficiently meet the needs of the Latino students whom this legislation is intended to support,\u201d Del. David Fraser-Hidalgo, D-Montgomery, the chair of the Latino Caucus, wrote to Hogan.\nFraser-Hidalgo also wrote that the Latino population has grown to nearly 12% in Maryland, according to the 2020 census, and that \u201cLatino youth constitutes the largest proportion of English Language Learners.\u201d\nSauls addressed the bipartisan blowback over the committee\u2019s decision not to present any Latino nominees.\n\u201c(It was) as diverse as we could get, given the pool we had, which was limited in terms of Latinx representation,\u201d Sauls said.\nOf the 43 applicants, only one identified as Hispanic and one as Afro-Latino, according to a Sept. 1 press release from the nominating committee.\nHogan also expressed concerns about the nominees\u2019 geographic distribution.\n\u201cWhile many of the nominees selected are undoubtedly qualified individuals, there is a discernible lack of representation from the majority of jurisdictions in the State,\u201d Hogan noted in his letter.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nPrince George\u2019s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, D, also wrote a letter to Hogan, expressing her concern that none of the nominees live in Prince George\u2019s County, the state\u2019s second-most populous jurisdiction.\n\u201cWhile I appreciate that a representative from Prince George\u2019s County Community College will be considered...(the nominee) is not a county resident, nor does she interact with our public schools on a daily basis,\u201d Alsobrooks wrote.\nSen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s, who serves as vice-chair of the nominating committee, responded to that concern.\n\u201cI actually solicited from people in Prince George\u2019s County who are very respected, and they chose not to do it,\u201d Pinsky told Capital News Service.\nAs of mid-day Sept. 17, the committee had not reopened applications.\n\u201cRight now there have been no changes to that slate of nine,\u201d Sauls said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know until I hear further from the attorney general.\u201d\n\u201cSince we provide counsel to the committee, any advice we may provide would be privileged,\u201d Raquel Coombs, a spokesperson for the Maryland attorney general\u2019s office, wrote in an email to Capital News Service.",

    "summary": "Maryland is experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks in 43 schools, with over 200 schools having had outbreaks since October 2020, according to state health data. Baltimore County leads with the highest number of cases and affected schools, including two private schools that reported significant case numbers in February.",
    "content": "State data shows multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools across Maryland.\nThere are currently 43 schools experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, according to the Maryland Department of Health website.\nSince the website started tracking COVID-19 outbreaks in Maryland schools in October 2020, there have been outbreaks in 216 schools.\n\n\n\nSchools listed as experiencing an outbreak on the website have at least two confirmed COVID-19 cases among students, teachers or staff who are epidemiologically linked, at least three classrooms or cohorts with cases from separate households, or at least five percent of the entire school population have confirmed COVID-19 within a 14-day period. Schools are removed from the list once health officials determine that 14 days have passed with no new cases and no tests pending.\nTwo schools stand out for a consistently high number of cases. Bais Yaakov Eva Winer High School, an all-girls private school in Baltimore County, hit a peak of 51 reported cases on Feb. 17, 2021. Talmudical Academy, an all-boys private school in Baltimore County, reached 72 reported cases on Feb. 10, 2021. Cases in both schools have decreased since mid-February. Archived data can be found here.\nOf the localities in Maryland, including 23 counties and Baltimore City, 15 have at least one school currently experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. Baltimore County currently has the highest number of cases and schools on the list with 58 and 13, respectively. Washington County is second in both categories, registering 56 cases and nine schools on the list.\n\n\n\nPublic schools on the list have a total of 152 cases across 30 schools, an average of 5.07 cases per school, while the private schools listed have a total 57 cases across 13 schools, an average of 4.4 cases per school.\n\n\n\nBaltimore and Washington County, currently the counties with the highest number of positive cases in schools, both rank in the top half of infection rates per 1,000 people for all Maryland counties. Baltimore County has an infection rate of 74.8 per 1,000 people while Washington County\u2019s infection rate is 92.3 per 1,000 people.\nWorcester County has the third highest number of positive cases in schools, with all 24 cases reported at Stephen Decatur High School. The county ranks right in the middle with 67.4 cases per 1,000 people.\nWashington County Public Schools (WCPS) have been in the fourth phase of their \u201cReturn to Learn\u201d plan since Feb. 16. In this phase, students are able to attend in-person classes five days a week while distance learning is offered to those who do not wish to return to the classroom yet.\n\u201cOther schools across the state and across our county have seen similar case numbers, but they are not included in the dashboard because two or more cases are not epidemiologically linked,\u201d said Erin Anderson, a Communications Officer for WCPS. \u201cOverwhelmingly, we have found that individuals catch COVID-19 from activities outside of school and we have been able to prevent the spread of the virus in our schools.\u201d\nAnderson noted that the Washington County Health Department has not deemed it necessary to close the schools on the state\u2019s outbreak list.\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) has long been vocal about the reopening of schools, having called on schools, on Jan. 21, to do their best to reopen by March 1 if they hadn\u2019t already.\nIn a letter addressed to Cheryl Bost, President of the Maryland State Education Association, on Jan. 21, Hogan and Karen Salmon, State Superintendent of Schools, called for schools to reopen. An increase in learning loss and failing grades was a driving factor in Hogan\u2019s push to open schools, according to the letter.\n\u201cThe clear social and emotional toll that online learning has taken on students, families, and educators is yet another unquantifiable impact of the prolonged school building closure,\u201d wrote Hogan and Salmon. \u201cTherefore, immediate action must be taken by every school system in our State to provide opportunities for in-person instruction to all students.\u201d\nOn March 19, the CDC released new studies recommending that students should maintain three feet of social distance in classrooms where mask mandates are required.\nSix feet of social distancing is recommended where transmission rates are high and cohorting is not possible. Teachers and other faculty are recommended to remain six feet apart when interacting with both students and other adults.\n\u201cIt will never be \u2014 and never has been \u2014 100 percent risk-free to return to school. We know a lot more than we did last spring about how to prevent transmission, and vaccination is on the rise,\u201d Allison Barlett, Associate Professor of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at University of Chicago Medicine, told the New York Times. \u201cThere are significant deleterious effects on children who are learning remotely, and that needs to get equal attention.\u201d\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in-person learning in schools has not contributed to substantial community outbreaks. Children age 5-17 account for just under 10% of COVID-19 cases in the United States.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Maryland has been one of the slowest states in returning students to in-person learning, as only 57.4 percent of its students have gone back to in-person classes. As of April 20, only four states \u2014 California, Hawaii, New Mexico and Oregon \u2014 have a smaller percentage of students back in classrooms, according to Burbio, a website that has been tracking the return of students to classrooms during the pandemic.\nPrince George\u2019s County became the last school district in Maryland to begin reopening their schools on April 6. As of April 22, Prince George\u2019s County has no school cases or schools experiencing outbreaks and has an infection rate of 90 per 1,000 people.",

    "summary": "Maryland is addressing the digital divide with the Digital Connectivity Act, aiming to provide all residents with affordable, high-quality broadband internet and necessary tools, especially after the pandemic highlighted the critical need for stable online connections in daily life. Before the pandemic, 520,000 Maryland households lacked broadband access, significantly impacting education and work.",
    "content": "The digital divide has become a major talking point since the pandemic forced jobs, schools and doctors\u2019 offices online.\nBut concerns with the growing divide between those with and without broadband access arose before the pandemic forced millions of Americans to shelter in place.\nThe Abell Foundation found in a 2020 report that 520,000 households in Maryland did not have access to broadband internet at home.\nThe Federal Communications Commission defines broadband internet as a service providing a download speed of 25Mbps and an upload speed of 3Mbps.\nAs jobs and schools were forced online, access to a stable internet connection became even more important to day-to-day life, especially in education.\nThe Maryland State Education Association reported in July that 82% of their members said access to reliable internet was a problem for students, while 44% of educators themselves had issues.\n\u201cIf our students don\u2019t have the equipment that they need, then they are living in digital darkness,\u201d said state Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith, D-Prince George\u2019s.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine rollout\u2019s early days were also plagued with difficulty, as myriad websites used to register created frustration.\nTo combat the growing digital divide, lawmakers in Annapolis passed SB66/HB97, also known as the Digital Connectivity Act.\nThe legislation\u2019s aim, according to the bill\u2019s summary is to ensure: \u201cevery resident of the State is supported by high-quality broadband Internet service at an affordable price and has the tools necessary to use and take advantage of the Internet.\u201d\n\u201cClearly there were divides in access to high-speed internet before the pandemic.\u201d Del. Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, who sponsored the house bill, said.\nLierman acknowledged that the digital divide was not a new problem, but an issue made worse by a pandemic that made Marylanders more dependent on high-speed internet access.\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s the ability to work from home, visiting the doctor through a zoom appointment rather than in person\u2026the pandemic has really exposed the preexisting digital divide.\u201d\nThe bill, signed into law on Apr. 13, expanded the current Office of Rural Broadband established by Gov. Larry Hogan, R, by executive order in 2017 into a statewide organization.\nThe Office of Rural Broadband, now known as the Office of Statewide Broadband, will oversee efforts to expand infrastructure and close the digital literacy gap statewide.\nBefore its elevation to a statewide office, the Office of Rural Broadband had already made strides to increase broadband access in the state\u2019s 18 rural counties.\nIn 2020, the office funded 21 projects, including a $5.8 million effort to construct new infrastructure in Charles County.\nThe expansion constructed by ThinkBig Networks LLC, a regional ISP serving Charles, Kent, and Queen Anne\u2019s counties, will bring internet speeds of up to a gigabit per second to some 1,408 homes and 76 businesses.\nKenrick Gordon, the director of the Office of State Broadband, acknowledged that physical infrastructure was only part of the problem.\nA digital literacy program aimed at educating Marylanders on the resources available to them is also in the planning stages.\nThe office has also established a speed test website to gather more accurate information about speed and accessibility to broadband internet across the state (https://maryland.speedsurvey.org/)\n\u201cThose who have never had broadband access need to understand the services and resources that will be available to them and make informed decisions when they can access broadband,\u201d Gordon said.\nSB66/HB97 passed both chambers with great bipartisan support in both the House of Delegates and the Senate.\nThe bill was amended to establish a mandate to expand broadband access to 98% of Marylanders by Dec. 31, 2025, as well as establishing two funds to enhance broadband access.\nThe Digital Inclusion fund establishes grants of up to $500,000 to nonprofits and local governments working to expand training education on broadband tools.\nA Digital Connectivity fund was also established to provide grants for communities working to expand access to disconnected communities.\nThe creation of the Office of Statewide Broadband comes one month after Hogan announced how the $3.9 billion in American Rescue Plan would be used.\n\nSome $300 million was dedicated to broadband infrastructure, with the largest amount doled out to dealing with physical infrastructure, and the rest going to device subsidies and municipal grants.\nThe funds will help the Office of Statewide Broadband deal with both issues of affordability and broadband infrastructure, Gordon said.\nSen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, said that federal money both provided in the American Rescue Plan and proposed in future federal legislation would help establish broadband as a more \u201cubiquitous\u201d service.",

    "summary": "Maryland's public school reopening plan remains one of the slowest in the nation, with roughly half of normal in-person instruction available despite moderate COVID-19 spread. Expert analysis suggests that schools can safely reopen without significantly impacting community virus transmission rates, emphasizing a disconnect between current evidence and policy decisions.",
    "content": "Maryland public school students have had some of the least opportunities in the nation to attend regular in-person instruction despite the state\u2019s moderate COVID-19 spread.\nRoughly half of normal in-person instruction is open in Maryland \u2014 the fifth-lowest in the nation as of April 13, according to Burbio, a community event tracker.\nMaryland ranks toward the middle of states in daily average of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days, at 23, according to the New York Times tracker.\nJohn Bailey, a visiting fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute \u2014 a Washington, D.C.-based think tank \u2014 produced a report in March analyzing the variety of studies around the world regarding COVID-19 spread and schools.\nA common theme in these studies that the report details is that school reopenings, so long as they follow safety protocols, do not impact COVID-19 outbreaks in their surrounding communities.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of learning from the past year that we haven\u2019t adjusted it to the reopening of schools,\u201d Bailey told Capital News Service. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been grounding these decisions in evidence.\u201d\nBailey emphasized the contrast between early concerns about COVID-19 and children to the resulting research over the past year.\nWhile there were early concerns that children would be especially at risk to COVID-19 as they were to diseases like influenza, research has been clear that children, in terms of severity of symptoms, are at little to no risk of the coronavirus.\nAnother concern was that children would spread the virus by going to school regularly, but research has consistently shown that children spread the virus at a lesser rate than adults.\nAs of April 11, 59.4% of students in the country attend schools with a traditional everyday schedule, 28.4% attend schools with a hybrid schedule, and 12.2% attend schools that are virtual only, according to Burbio.\n\nMonday marks the final phase of the reopening plan in Maryland, as six districts, including Baltimore County and Montgomery County, will be welcoming students for more regular in-person instruction. (http://marylandpublicschools.org/newsroom/Documents/School-System-Instructional-Status-Form.pdf)\nWhile there is no public data on the number of teachers vaccinated in Maryland, Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, told CNS her union is getting fewer calls from members asking about vaccination appointments.\nBost said she\u2019s heard some concerns from her members regarding lackadaisical enforcements of safety protocols and the quality of HVAC systems in aging school buildings.\nBost added that there could be more transparency at the state level in terms of detailing the number of COVID-19 cases in schools \u2014 a common theme nationwide.\nThe Maryland State Department of Education released data in March showing that in the second quarter of the school year (November 2020 to January 2021), jurisdictions with a middle school student failure rate of 20% in math and science increased by 800% in comparison to the previous year.\nThe data for high school students shows an 800% increase for math and a 300% increase for science. Increases in failure rates of English and social studies trended in similar directions.\nWhen asked about the trend, Bost said that Maryland is not alone and that the comparison to a year with a pandemic is unfair.\n\u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cHow does your electric bill compare to other years? We\u2019re home a lot more now.\u201d\nBost did not express any concern that Maryland students could be falling further behind than states with more in-person instruction.\nBost instead pointed with optimism to the recently passed, multi-billion dollar annual education plan, Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future, which is set to increase teacher pay, direct additional resources to poverty-stricken jurisdictions, and create new career training opportunities in schools.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunities moving forward with the Blueprint plan,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be so much more opportunity here in Maryland now.\u201d\nBailey attributed the hesitancy of school reopenings in areas like Maryland in part to partisan fights and labor union conflicts.\n\u201cA lot of people have played into fear-mongering,\u201d Bailey told CNS. \u201cWe should have been celebrating these insights that we\u2019ve been learning and highlighting these best practices.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Bailey said analyzing the impact of a lack of in-person instruction over the past year will focus on three main aspects.\nThe short-term effects, which he said are mostly being studied now, focus on the academic progress and mental health of students.\nThen, he said, there\u2019s the \u201cmedium-term\u201d \u2014 which regards college and career decisions.\nIn the long term, he said, shortcomings in these areas could lead to lost earnings and economic opportunity.",

    "content": "College athletes could be allowed to profit off of their name, image and likeness, and would be better protected under a bill that passed the Maryland House of Delegates this week.\u00a0\nHB0125 and its cross-file, SB0439, with sponsors Del. Brooke E. Lierman, D-Baltimore, Sen. Justin Ready, R-Carroll and Sen. Chris West, R-Baltimore County, are part of a growing conversation nationally surrounding the economic, mental and physical well-being of college athletes.\nAlso titled the Jordan McNair Safe and Fair Play Act, the bill aims to protect student athletes from tragedies like McNair\u2019s death, and cases of sexual abuse as seen with the Michigan State University gymnastics team.\n\u201cThese are the stakes, life and death, sexual assault, and racial and economic justice \u2014 it\u2019s time for Maryland to end the exploitation of its college athletes by adopting HB0125,\u201d Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Player\u2019s Association, said at a Jan. 27 House Appropriations Commitee hearing.\nOn June 13, 2018, McNair died two weeks after passing out from heat stroke during an offseason workout with the University of Maryland football team.\u00a0\nFive other states have already passed legislation surrounding name, image and likeness \u2014 including Florida, where the bill goes into effect July 1.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for the Maryland General Assembly to stand up to the NCAA and to support our Maryland student athletes,\u201d Lierman said at the hearing.\nUnder current NCAA rules, student athletes are prohibited from profiting off of their name, image and likeness.\nThe NCAA Division I Council was scheduled to vote on the issue in early January, but the vote was delayed and is expected to resume in late March.\u00a0\n\u201cWe would like to see the NCAA get to a point that falls in line with what we\u2019re doing and other states around the country are doing,\u201d University of Maryland Athletic Director Damon Evans told Capital News Service.\u00a0\nEvery other college student who is not an NCAA athlete has the ability to earn money whatever legal way they want using their name, image or likeness.\nProponents of the bill also pinpointed the disparity between college athletes being prevented from earning income off their name, image and likeness, while athletic directors and coaches are often the highest paid public employees in the state.\nMaryland basketball head coach Mark Turgeon was scheduled to make roughly $3 million in 2020, while football head coach Mike Locksley was scheduled to earn a $2.65 million salary in 2020, according to USA Today.\nUniversity of Maryland President Darryll J. Pines was expected to earn $750,000 this year before a 15% pay cut.\n\u201cThese are unnecessary and anti-competitive restrictions; it has the effect of exacerbating student athlete\u2019s financial challenges,\u201d Ready said at a Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee hearing Feb. 25.\nThe ability to generate revenue off of their name, image and likeness could be particularly beneficial for female athletes as well as those athletes of color and those from underprivileged backgrounds.\nFemale athletes traditionally don\u2019t have as many opportunities to pursue their sport at a professional level, which means that they have fewer opportunities to profit than their male counterparts.\nAthletes of color and those from disadvantaged backgrounds can be disproportionately affected by the inability to profit off of their name, image and likeness compared to other non-minority athletes and those from more privileged backgrounds.\n\u201cName, image and likeness is going to help a lot of athletes across all sports,\u201d Evans told Capital News Service.\nEvans also explained that this could be beneficial for athletes across all sports to create a brand for themselves through social media.\nThe University System of Maryland initially expressed concern with the verbiage of some components of the bill, specifically some of the stipulations involving name, image and likeness, which they explained could present an issue for universities in the state deviating from NCAA policy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe University System of Maryland also wanted to ensure that the guidelines proposed for health and safety weren\u2019t already imposed and would act as an extension to the policies currently in place.\nAs such the bill passed the House Appropriations Committee unanimously with amendments that specify the scope of name, image and likeness and would only add health and safety protocols that aren\u2019t currently utilized by institutions within the University System of Maryland.\nOne of the amendments in the bill prevents athletes from using certain types of advertising including those that utilize the branding or logo of their school without permission from the institution or the athletic department.\nBeyond the economic impact of the bill, it also introduces several measures to protect a student athlete\u2019s mental and physical well-being.\nUnder this legislation, any intercollegiate athletic program at a public institution in the state is responsible for developing guidelines to prevent, assess and treat serious sports-related conditions including brain injury, heat illness, and rhabdomyolysis, according to the bill.\nAll three of those injuries can be caused by excessive workload or stress in a workout.\n\u201cWe recognize that the need to pass legislation in order to help save the lives of student athletes is more critical than ever,\u201d Marty McNair, McNair\u2019s father and the founder of the Jordan McNair Foundation, said at a Jan. 27 hearing.\u00a0\n\u201cAccording to the CDC, heat illnesses have been recognized as the leading cause of death and disability among student athletes,\u201d McNair added.\nThe bill also would establish protocols for players returning from serious injury as well as guidelines for those athletes who suffer from conditions like sickle-cell disease and asthma.\nIn addition, the University System of Maryland Intercollegiate Athletics Workgroup along with Morgan State University and St. Mary\u2019s College would be responsible for submitting a report to the General Assembly on any changes with student athlete policy on or before Oct. 1, 2021, and each year thereafter, according to the bill.\nIn support of the bill, Del. Ben Barnes, D-Anne Arundel and Prince George\u2019s explained that the Legislature shouldn\u2019t wait for the NCAA to make their ruling and instead should put pressure on them to do the right thing by student athletes.\n\u201cA government or bureaucracy telling you what to do with your name, that is fundamentally un-American, that is not who we are, these athletes deserve to control their name, image, and likeness,\u201d Barnes said at the floor session.\nThe House version of the bill passed 122-12 Wednesday and has been referred to the Senate Education, Health and Environment Affairs Committee.\u00a0\nNo voting session for the Senate version of the bill has been scheduled.\n\u201cWe go to their games, we tweet our support, and we support them in our words,\u201d Lierman said.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time we should support them here where we can truly make a difference, through passing this legislation,\u201d Lierman added.",

The bill, HB0817 and SB0759, aims to waive certain eligibility requirements for the 2021 graduates, providing them with a chance to complete their high school athletic careers.",
    "content": "Legislation in Maryland could allow senior athletes at public high schools to play sports the year after they graduate, to make up for the challenges and unusual circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\nBased on the current rules set forth by the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association \u2014 winter, spring and fall sports each have a finite start and end date \u2014 with traditional fall sports scheduled to play their seasons in early winter carrying over into spring.\u00a0\nFor example, traditional fall sports \u2014 such as soccer, field hockey and volleyball \u2014 weren\u2019t eligible to begin practicing in some Maryland counties until Feb. 13, drastically different from their typical starting date in the summer before the school year.\u00a0\nThis poses an issue for athletes who traditionally participate in both a fall and spring sport, as both the practice and competition times for the seasons overlap.\nHB0817 and its cross-file SB0759, with sponsors Del. Haven Shoemaker, and Sen. Justin Ready, both R-Carroll, aims to provide senior high school athletes another opportunity to finish what they started keeping in mind these challenges.\n\u201cWe want student-athletes to have the opportunity to finish their high school athletic careers properly,\u201d Ready said in a press release.\nA graduate athlete is considered anyone who was enrolled in grade 12 at a public high school in the state during the 2020-21 school year, graduated from the public high school in 2021 and was eligible to participate in an interscholastic sport at the high school level during the 2020-21 school year, according to a legislative analysis.\nThis bill stipulates that the Maryland State Department of Education waive several eligibility requirements for these athletes including academic progress requirements, age restrictions and graduate eligibility restrictions.\u00a0\nTherefore, if someone graduates in June 2021 they may come back and play their respective sport during the 2021-2022 school year.\u00a0\nHowever, the athlete can only return to play at the same public high school from which they graduated; they can\u2019t transition to another high school post-graduation.\n\u201cHigh school sports mean so much to all our communities as well as the student-athletes who have worked for years to get to where they are,\u201d Ready said in that same release.\nIn early February, Kentucky state legislators filed a bill similar in principle that could allow the state\u2019s high school students, including athletes, to receive a fifth year of instruction and eligibility.\u00a0\nHowever, that bill is more encompassing because it could also allow any student enrolled in a Kentucky public high school during the 2020-21 school year to request that the 2021-2022 school year be used as a supplemental year to retake or supplement any courses a student has previously taken.\nProponents of the Maryland bill assert that its passing could be beneficial to students who were on the fringe of potentially receiving an athletic scholarship, but had their final high school season taken away.\u00a0\nWhile the new law would most likely only be utilized by those students attending local community college or trade school, the passing of this bill gives athletes further opportunity to advance their athletic career at the collegiate level.\n\u201cThe students that were forced to sacrifice all or most of their final year of high school sports deserve the opportunity to enjoy their final season, as well as compete for scholarships that may have been lost due to their inability to play,\u201d Shoemaker said in a press release.\nHowever, there is some skepticism among some high school coaches surrounding the number of athletes who would take advantage of this policy, particularly for college recruiting purposes.\u00a0\n\u201cMost of the recruiting for soccer, lacrosse and other sports comes outside of high school,\u201d Edward Wharton, head soccer coach at South Carroll High School, told Capital News Service.\nRecruiting for those sports outside of football is done at the club level, independent from the school system, which allowed many of them to be operational during the pandemic.\nSpecifically from a football recruiting perspective, that\u2019s where the legislation could be the most beneficial.\u00a0\n\u201cGreat for the young men to get some more film for college opportunities,\u201d Michael Kraus, head football coach at South Carroll High School told Capital News Service.\nHowever, Kraus explained that this bill could lead to graduate athletes taking playing time away from younger players, which could be counterproductive to the younger players\u2019 athletic development.\u00a0\nAnother concern is that the bill could create a slippery slope, prompting other high school classes to want similar treatment.\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s opening Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d Jack Walsh, head football coach at Arundel High School, told Capital News Service.\nWalsh also explained that the inclusion of graduate athletes on teams with current high school students could interrupt camaraderie as fans would be cheering on players no longer enrolled at the school.\nThe Maryland Association of Boards of Education opposed the bill, citing concerns that it would disrupt interscholastic sports.\nThe association also voiced concerns that if passed, the bill would create a separation in the statewide athletic system between high school athletes enrolled in school and those who aren\u2019t.\n\u201cHouse Bill 817 would disrupt this balance by introducing a significant separation between the status of high school athletes who are no longer enrolled students, the enrolled students in the educational setting, and the sports team on which the students and non-students are participating,\u201d John R. Woolums director of governmental relations for the Maryland Association of Boards of Education said in written testimony obtained by Capital News Service.\nThe Maryland Association of Boards of Education and The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association also explained that under this legislation, local school systems would have to review liability policies with non-enrolled students participating in sports on school grounds.\nNo voting session has been scheduled yet for either the House or Senate bill.",

    "content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s $130 billion school reopening plan focuses on making schools safer for teachers and students, although returning to school remains a contentious and difficult issue.\nReopening the majority of K-8 schools within his first 100 days in office is a key part of the president\u2019s $1.9 trillion \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan\u201d passed by the House on Friday on a party-line vote and now under consideration in the Senate.\n\u201cWe can do this if we give the school districts, the schools themselves, the communities, and the states the clear guidance they need, as well as the resources they need that they can\u2019t afford right now because of the economic dilemma we are in,\u201d Biden said in January.\u00a0\nSupporters of the rescue measure will need every one of the 50 Democratic senators to vote for it. Under a procedural process known as reconciliation, a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris vote would allow the package to pass by a simple majority vote.\nSafety measures such as social-distancing and mask-wearing are put into place for students and teachers at schools that are reopening. (Kaitlyn Cupelli/Capital News Service)\nAlthough congressional Republicans also are supportive of returning kids to school, many do not support Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion relief plan.\u00a0\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement after the House vote that Democrats \u201cjammed through a bill that even liberal economists and editorial boards say is not well targeted to this stage of the fight.\u201d\n\u201cMore than a third of its spending, including more than 90% of the K-12 school funding, would not even go out this fiscal year,\u201d he said.\nThe back-to-school plan calls for more COVID-19 testing and transportation, additional cleaning and sanitizing services, protective equipment, and ventilation systems in schools. School districts could also use funds to take additional safety measures such as:\n\nReducing class sizes so students and teachers can maintain social distance;\u00a0\nHiring more janitors and implementing mitigation measures;\u00a0\nEnsuring every school has access to a nurse;\u00a0\nHiring counselors to support students as they transition back to the classroom;\nClosing the digital divide that has amplified inequalities during the pandemic;\nProviding summer schools for students who have lost learning time;\nPreventing cuts to state pre-k programs.\u00a0\n\nThe COVID-19 Educational Equity Challenge Grant will also be funded by the Biden plan, said Christian Unkenholz, spokesman for Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Largo. The grant will support state, local and tribal governments in working with teachers and families to respond to COVID-related educational challenges.\n\u201cThis is a question of justice and equity,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWithout this aid, our schools, students and educators will be left to fend for themselves, potentially further delaying the return to in-classroom instruction and leaving kids behind. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has particularly hurt lower-income students, Black and Latino students, and students with disabilities, according to the U.S. Department of Education. \nThe pandemic also has led to increased absences, poor learning outcomes, more hungry kids, and more social isolation.\nResearch on disrupted instruction shows that the cumulative learning loss for students by the end of the 2020-2021 school year could equate to five to nine months on average, said Lora Rakowski, director of communications for the Maryland Department of Education.\n\u201cMany students rely on our school system for food,\u201d Joe Weedon, a member of the Washington Teachers\u2019 Union, told Capital News Service.\u00a0 \u201c(Our schools) assure they have safe places so they can focus on their work.\u201d\u00a0\nThousands of Washington students returned to school on Feb. 2 as part of the city\u2019s public schools\u2019 expansion of in-person classroom learning. Twenty-three million dollars was used to prepare buildings for the return to schools, Weedon said, although he said he still has serious concerns about the readiness of a number of facilities.\nMany District of Columbia schools have not yet released data about the quality of their air systems, so it is unknown if the buildings meet the nation\u2019s air release guidelines, Weedon said. Teachers are also only just beginning to receive vaccinations, meaning very few individuals have immunity from COVID-19 at this point.\nWith hybrid-learning, teachers will be asked to do a lot more work, as they will have to teach partially from home and partially at school \u2013 a change that they are not used to, Weedon said. He added that the District\u2019s current return-to-school is not a return to normal, but a return to the safety of their school buildings.\n\u201cWe\u2019d all love a return to normal, but we are still in a pandemic,\u201d Weedon said.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, also has submitted a $1.5 billion supplemental budget focused on education.\u00a0\n\u201cThis supplemental budget provides further support for the safe reopening of Maryland schools,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI want to commend all the teachers, administrators, parents, and public health officials who are doing everything they can to give Maryland students the chance to get back in the classrooms safely.\u201d\nThe budget includes:\u00a0\n\n$931 million to support local school systems and targeted assistance for the safe reopening of public schools.\n$434 million in additional funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Pandemic EBT\u00a0program. This program is intended to help families in Maryland purchase food while schools remain closed due to COVID-19\n$128 million to support the state\u2019s Child Care Scholarship program, including almost $60 million to help support licensed child care providers recover from the impact of the pandemic.\n$35 million from the Governor\u2019s Emergency Education Relief Fund to support the safe reopening of nonpublic schools.\n$20 million from the same fund to support community colleges, private institutions of higher education, and competitive innovation grants.\n\nBy the end of March, 18 out of 24 Maryland school systems will be providing an opportunity for in-person instruction at least two days a week, in elementary, middle and high school grade levels, Rakowski said.\u00a0\nCarroll, Worcester, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil, Dorchester, Frederick, Queen Anne\u2019s, St. Mary\u2019s, Somerset, Talbot, Washington and Wicomico Counties are among the local school systems currently providing in-person, hybrid instruction.\nFour local school systems are not opening for all grade levels by the end of March, Rakowski said.\u00a0\nHarford County schools are open for elementary K-5 for two days, but only one day for middle and high school students. Baltimore City will open for elementary, K-5 and grades six and nine by the end of March. Charles County has a five-phase reopening plan and will start phase five on March 22, allowing special populations of students to meet in-person four days a week. Prince George\u2019s County will open some of its schools for the month of April.\u00a0\nAs more schools re-open, the Maryland State Education Association has developed a checklist of expectations for every school building, utilizing CDC, Department of Health, and Department of Education health and safety guidelines.\nCheryl Bost, MSEA president and a Baltimore County elementary school teacher, said she believes accelerating the availability of vaccines to teachers,\u00a0as well as following safety guidelines like adequate ventilation and social distancing, are key to protecting the health of students, educators, and families.\n\u201cWe all want to be in school, safely and sustainably, with our students,\u201d Bost told CNS.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s been our goal all along.\u201d",

    "content": "Many of Maryland\u2019s most populous districts are set to welcome some students back for in-person instruction Monday, marking the start of varying local plans in response to Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s push to reopen schools by March 1.\nMaryland had the lowest percentage of in-person instruction operating in the nation at 10 percent as of Sunday, according to Burbio, a community event tracker.\nThat number is expected to change drastically come Monday, when Montgomery County, Anne Arundel County, Howard County, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Harford County, and other smaller counties will bring some students back to school.\nPrince George\u2019s County became the final school district in the state to submit a reopening plan, early last week, detailing the return of students in April.\nThe number of days per week of in-person instruction varies in each district, with the most popular option being twice a week.\nThe schools will start with some grade levels, gradually bringing in more over the following weeks.\nStudents can still choose to attend school virtually only.\nHogan announced an executive order Tuesday requiring masks for anyone over the age of 5 on school grounds.\nEarly studies have shown little to no evidence that schools open for in-person instruction have led to a significant spread of the coronavirus in local communities.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in January that schools should return students to the classroom so long as they follow proper safety guidelines such as wearing masks and social distancing.\nSome Maryland districts have received criticism from teachers, who advocate for more specific and collaborative safety measures, while other districts have already opened with little to no resistance.\nTeachers in some school districts, including Anne Arundel County, Howard County, and Montgomery County organized recent protests as they were instructed to return to work at their respective schools.\nMaryland is one of the 35 states where teacher strikes are illegal, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality.\nCheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, told Capital News Service that these protests and overall criticism toward specific reopening plans are intended to ensure the voices of educators are heard and considered when implementing these plans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wrong narrative that we\u2019re trying to not open schools,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cWe want to open schools as long as they\u2019re safe and healthy.\u201d\nBost told CNS the key to maximizing the effectiveness of reopening plans is a collaboration between local district leaders, employees, and parents so that health guidelines are properly implemented.\nCommon safety measures from local districts include wearing masks, social distancing, and staggering the drop-off and pick-up times of students at multiple entrances and exits.\nBost also noted the importance of ensuring teachers are vaccinated before returning to schools, citing Cecil County as a prime example, where teachers have been vaccinated and started in-person instruction in February.\nWhile Bost criticized other counties for not vaccinating teachers before beginning in-person instruction, she said those educators are rightfully complying with reopening guidelines while voicing their concerns.\nThe CDC has continued to assert in recent weeks that the vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite of reopening in-person instruction.\nTeachers with health concerns regarding COVID-19 exposure should be specifically accommodated regarding the safety of reopening efforts, the CDC reported.\nRoughly half of in-person instruction is open across the country, according to Burbio.",

    "content": "After Maryland Democrats successfully pushed through a multi-billion dollar education reform bill last week, one Republican lawmaker has proposed pandemic-related education legislation of her own.\nHB0939, introduced by Del. Lauren Arikan, R-Harford and Baltimore counties, would, under the condition that a school district fails to open in-person instruction by the fall, give parents the option to reallocate the public school funds of their child toward an alternative school.\nArikan told the Capital News Service she has heard many concerning stories in parenting and education groups online about the devastating impact of virtual schooling on students.\n\u201cI was inspired by the daily heartbreaking posts I was seeing,\u201d she told CNS. \u201cChildren who weren\u2019t even able to read yet being expected to navigate computer programs. \u2026 And children with all different types of learning styles crying as they sat at the computer day after day.\u201d\nThe funds would come through a grant program overseen by the Maryland Department of Education that parents could apply to.\nThe state\u2019s Department of Education did not respond for comment on the feasibility of the potential program.\nNo additional state money would be spent, as the funds going toward the alternative school would be reallocated from the per-pupil spending of the public school the student attends.\nPer-pupil funding in Maryland is roughly $16,000, according to the Maryland Association of Counties, and would only cover a portion of most private schooling costs. A total of 22 of the 24 school districts have submitted plans to reopen for in-person instruction of some capacity by March 1, according to Gov. Larry Hogan.\nAlthough, Arikan said, there is still some concern as to whether the state\u2019s teachers union will cooperate with the districts to effectively reopen.\nArikan\u2019s bill draws many similarities to some other pandemic-inspired school choice legislation across the country.\nA Utah lawmaker, in an effort to ensure schools follow reopening plans for February, proposed a bill that would allow a portion of per-pupil funding from a school district to be reallocated to a private school of choice. Lawmakers have not yet voted on this bill.\nIn Illinois, a lawmaker proposed a bill that would provide a voucher to families who took their child out of the public school system due to ongoing virtual learning that is equivalent to the per-pupil spending \u2014 be that for private schooling or homeschooling. That bill is yet to be voted on.\nA Georgia bill reallocates per-pupil spending into a state fund that pays for private schooling and homeschooling for those who want to leave the public schools due to virtual learning. That bill is also yet to be voted on.\nCriticism of these voucher-related school choice programs, often coming from teacher unions, oppose the idea of taking away the per-pupil funds of public schools and giving it to private schools.\nThe Maryland State Education Association declined to comment on the bill to CNS.\nCorey DeAngelis, director of school choice at the Libertarian Reason Foundation and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, told CNS that school choice policies like Arikan\u2019s bill are resonating more with parents amid the pandemic for good reason, but should be established regardless of whether instruction is virtual or in-person.\nDeAngelis emphasized the importance of competition within the school system to ensure the best education options are being pursued.\n\u201cPrivate schools have been fighting to reopen, but so many teachers unions have been fighting to remain closed,\u201d he told CNS. \u201cThe difference is one of incentives. One of these sectors gets your money regardless of how well they meet the needs of their customers, and in this case, regardless of whether they even open their doors for business.\u201d\nA number of different surveys have shown rising support for different school choice policies nationwide, according to EdChoice.org.\nAlthough, these policies are mostly supported by Republican legislators at the state level across the country.\nHogan has emphasized his support for school choice during his time as governor, issuing a proclamation declaring January 24-30 as Maryland school choice week.\nHogan also lit the Maryland Government House red in January to display his support of school choice policy.\nThe bill is scheduled for a hearing in the Ways and Means committee at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 The veto of a multi-billion dollar education bill in Maryland may be overridden this week, along with tax increases to fund it, as the state Legislature is expected to take up the three related bills by Friday.\nThe Senate is expected to override Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future education bill during its Friday session, after it was overridden first by the House of Delegates Monday.\nThe bill includes a 10-year plan that increases state funding to address issues of concern within the education system detailed by the Kirwan Commission.\nIf passed into law, HB1300 would increase teacher pay, provide additional resources for schools in poverty-stricken jurisdictions, expand prekindergarten, and more.\nMany local school and teacher advocacy groups, such as Strong Schools Maryland and the Maryland State Education Association, have backed efforts from the Democratic leadership to pass the Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future.\n\u201cWe are optimistic that the Senate will vote to override the veto soon and get the Blueprint across the legislative finish line, which is just the start of this transformational work to support our students, educators, and schools,\u201d said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, in a press release.\nRepublicans oppose the bill due to concerns over the ensuing tax increases needed to fund it, especially amid a pandemic.\n\u201cThe last year has been challenging for all Marylanders and the last thing they need right now is higher taxes and increased costs,\u201d Assistant Minority Leader Matt Morgan, R-St. Mary\u2019s, said in a press release. \u201cUnfortunately, there are far too many legislators who don\u2019t understand how to lead or manage through a crisis unless it involves raising taxes.\u201d\nThe Blueprint for Maryland\u2019s Future would cost roughly $15 billion in total through 2030, according to a fiscal analysis.\nMaryland ranks 15th among states in per-pupil spending for education, according to educationdata.org.\nThe Kirwan bill cites income and sales taxes, along with gaming proceeds, as revenue used to fund the plan.\nThe Democratic leadership has two additional bills that would increase and establish specific taxes as an effort to fund the program long term, as the annual expenditure of the plan increases 273 percent from 2022 to 2030.\nThe 21st\u2013Century Economy Fairness Act, HB0932, which establishes taxes on digital goods such as streaming services, e-books, and apps, was passed last year and vetoed by the governor, but that veto was also overridden by the House on Monday. \nAnother tax bill passed last year and vetoed by the governor, HB0732, would have established the nation\u2019s first tax on digital advertising, in addition to increasing taxes on tobacco products. \nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones\u2019 office, D-Baltimore County, told Capital News Service the plan is for the House to vote on overturning the HB0732 veto Thursday.\nThe Senate then plans to overturn the vetoes on tax increases Friday in addition to overturning the Kirwan veto, Sen. Arthur Ellis, D-Charles, told CNS.\nOnce a veto is overridden by both chambers, it becomes law.\nRepublican leadership in both chambers have made clear their opposition to raising and establishing new taxes amid a pandemic, but Democrats have a veto-proof majority.\nMarylanders For Tax Fairness has led the campaign against the digital advertisement tax, arguing that a tax on big tech companies\u2019 advertising would lead them to charge businesses more, which would hurt Maryland businesses during a pandemic that has led to a significant increase in online advertising.\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s hitting big out-of-state companies, but in reality, he\u2019s swinging and missing \u2014 and he\u2019s going to hit his own constituents in the mouth,\u201d Doug Mayer, spokesman for the organization told CNS regarding Senate President Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore. \u201cThere\u2019s not a law they could pass that could stop an out-of-state company from raising prices.\u201d\nMayer also said there could be potential legal concerns on whether the state can selectively tax digital advertising while laying off taxing other forms of advertising.\nThe House session Thursday and Senate session Friday can be livestreamed on the legislature\u2019s website, mgaleg.maryland.gov.",

Michelle Guyton, D-Baltimore County, before last year\u2019s session.\u00a0\nThey said they had immense success with therapy dogs, but the lack of county or statewide guidance was an obstacle.\u00a0\nA dog lover whose sons had made use of canine therapy, Guyton was immediately interested.\u00a0\n\u201cWe really, really believe in this program,\u201d Guyton said.\u00a0\nTherapy dogs can serve a number of purposes.\u00a0\nThe canines can be used for emotional support, or, on some occasions, to help nervous students in the classroom, Guyton said.\nThe SPCA of Maryland\u2019s Wagging Tales program works with grades 1-3, and has 15 therapy teams.\u00a0\nAfter being in the classroom with the organization, Community Relations Director Katie Flory saw that uncomfortable readers became far more relaxed \u2014 and that their performance improved.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re reading to a pet, there\u2019s no judgment there,\u201d Flory said.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile dogs don\u2019t serve as a panacea, Flory said, they can help teachers and students alike \u2014 assisting with learning as well as fostering a comfortable environment.\n\u201cThis is a missing resource right now that I feel like could be really beneficial,\u201d Flory said.\nA common misconception is that dogs will be around throughout the day, Flory said, but that\u2019s not usually the case.\u00a0\nWagging Tales has found that targeting certain subjects \u2014 English, for example \u2014 or even going into a class at the right times, can maximize learning potential.\nUltimately, schools will be charged with providing detailed policies for how and where the dogs can be used.\nSpecifically, the bill encourages boards of education to consider guidelines for dog handlers, as well as offer detailed communication with parents and students.\u00a0\nThe proper definition of a therapy dog is complicated; they\u2019re not emotional support dogs, or Americans with Disabilities Act service dogs, per Disability Rights Maryland.\u00a0\nService dogs are typically trained to cater to handlers\u2019 disabilities, like offering support to blind people.\u00a0\nTherapy dogs serve an entirely different purpose, often providing psychological or physiological support to individuals other than their handlers, according to the Alliance of Therapy dogs.\nThese dogs, then, have to be more mild-mannered, and enamored with human interaction \u2014 preferring tummy rubs to strict discipline, Flory said.\u00a0\nGuyton drew inspiration and support from an expansive program in New York City, which saw positive results after having dogs in 55 public schools.\nTheir movement started six years ago, and as many as 300 schools in New York have shown interest; some of their members will give testimony during the bill\u2019s hearing next week.\u00a0\nA similar bill did not pass last year, when the General Assembly ended early, in Mid-March.\u00a0\nAt the time, detractors raised numerous concerns about the legality of dogs in the classroom.\u00a0\nThe Maryland Association of Boards of Education, for example, argued the law would \u201cunreasonably mandate\u201d dog usage in a way that is inconsistent with federal and state codes.\nMaryland state law allows service dogs to accompany individual students in schools under the criteria provided by the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Act.\nUnder the current law, how and how frequently students use the dogs in schools is decided on a case-by-case basis \u2014 with no standardized usage policy.\u00a0\nAnd, crucially, therapy dogs are not defined as ADA service animals, meaning schools have no standardized criteria to permit them.\u00a0\nGuyton believes that this year\u2019s bill is more specific, and eases those concerns for county boards of education.\u00a0\n\u201cI feel like those issues have been mostly addressed,\u201d Guyton said.\u00a0\nCommittee members will hear those concerns \u2014 as well as support \u2014 next week in bill hearings on Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0\nSome school systems have already explored the possibility of having therapy dogs.\nBaltimore County has developed a successful partnership with Wagging Tales, and some schools in Montgomery County have also utilized canines for comfort.\nA similar bill is also in the works in Utah\u2019s state legislature.\n\u201cDogs really just want to give love and get love,\u201d Kramer said.",

    "content": "By CATHERINE SCOTT\nCapital News Service\nANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 After a two-year-long process, a family will be awarded a $3.5 million settlement from Maryland after their son, Jordan McNair, died during a university football practice.\nThe Board of Public Works voted unanimously during a meeting Wednesday to approve the request from the University of Maryland, College Park for the full settlement of all claims made by Martin McNair and Tonya Wilson, the parents of McNair.\n\u201cNo amount of money is ever gonna bring back Jordan to his family,\u201d Comptroller Peter Franchot, D, said at the meeting. \u201cThe McNair family entrusted the University of Maryland with Jordan\u2019s care and quite frankly, a number of people failed him.\u201d\nMcNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman for the University of Maryland, was hospitalized after he collapsed on the field because of a heat stroke in May of 2018.\nOn June 13, 2018, just 15 days later, McNair died.\nAn investigation into McNair\u2019s death found that the university\u2019s medical staff failed to identify McNair\u2019s symptoms, which contributed to his death.\n\u201cMarty and Tonya are relieved that this fight is over and to put this behind them as they continue to mourn Jordan\u2019s death,\u201d Hassan Murphy, attorney for McNair\u2019s parents, said in a statement on Jan. 15.\nMcNair\u2019s parents founded the Jordan McNair Foundation after their son\u2019s death to educate others on the signs of heatstroke and heat-related illnesses with hopes to reduce the occurrences, according to the organization website.\n\u201cWhile Jordan is not with us to build his legacy, as a family we are doing it for him. This is his legacy,\u201d Martin McNair wrote in a letter on the website.\nCurrent university President Darryll Pines announced in an email to students Wednesday a partnership with the foundation that will center on student-athlete safety.\nPines stated that Maryland Athletics has already implemented 41 reforms to enhance safety for student athletes after two external reviews were conducted on the program.\nMcNair\u2019s death also contributed to changes in leadership and administration at the University of Maryland.\nA few weeks after the tragedy, reports began to raise questions about a \u201cculture of intimidation\u201d and abuse under the then-head football coach, DJ Durkin, and the rest of the coaching staff, as reported by NBC Sports.\nAfter announcing his resignation as president of the university, then-President Wallace Loh decided to fire Durkin amidst growing pressures from fans, students, and alumni, Loh announced in an email to students on Oct. 31, 2018.\nThe university has since hired Mike Locksley to be the head coach, which is a decision that Marty McNair told ESPN he fully supports.\nIn addition, the board voted to approve a wetlands license for a project in Somerset County to extend natural gas service by installing pipelines under the Manokin River, Taylor Branch, and Kings Creek.\nSpeakers at the meeting against the project cited potential impacts to climate change as well as the belief that renewable energy would provide greater benefits as their reasoning for opposing.\nFranchot and others who spoke of their support discussed the economic parity and access to heating fuel the project would bring to Somerset County, which they stated is the poorest county in the state.\nThe board also voted to approve funding to the following:\n\n$121,735 toward the replacement of fire suppression equipment in the Maryland State House Building\n$889,200 toward the Sewer Sentinel Project to detect COVID-19 in wastewater and alert health professionals and citizens at risk\n$115,000 toward the Medical Cannabis Commission to add a contractor to assist in awarding additional licenses to meet the growing demand for medical cannabis",

    "content": "*Story has been updated to correct the starting school year in the 36th paragraph. \nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Brynleigh Shillinger\u2019s seizures started when she was just 9 months old.\nAnd when she started Kindergarten, her mother began lobbying for a law that would mandate teachers are trained to help her daughter if she got into distress at school.\nIn 2019, Lauren Shillinger, of Frederick County, called her Maryland state lawmakers about a bill.\nThe legislation would increase protections for children who experience seizures in school and mandate at least two staff members are trained how to medically respond.\nAll teachers would need to take online seizure recognition coursework every year \u2014 provided by the Epilepsy Foundation of America.\nThe bill has been dubbed \u201cBrynleigh\u2019s Act\u201d after Shillinger\u2019s daughter, whose rare genetic disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex, has caused her to have as many as 25 seizures per day.\nDel. Kenn Kerr, D-Frederick, has sponsored the bill, HB0370, noting that approximately 10 percent of people will have a seizure in their lifetime.\nHe and his co-sponsors are preparing for the chance that a student could experience one for the first time during school hours.\n\u201cThe likelihood that the first seizure will happen at school is pretty high,\u201d Kerr said.\nPer the bill \u2014 also filed in the Senate as SB0225 \u2014 those who respond will benefit from a Good Samaritan clause, thereby removing them from civil liability if they act responsibly.\nLauren Shillinger (left) stands next to Del. Ken Kerr, D-Frederick, at the State House in 2020. Photo courtesy of Lauren Shillinger.\nAdditionally, the legislation denotes that students diagnosed with epilepsy or seizure disorders should have a full medical record on file \u2014 as well as any prescribed medication ready to be used.\nThat\u2019s not something Maryland schools have offered before.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really an inconsistent and patchworked response to children\u2019s needs,\u201d said Lauren DiBitetto, an advocate for the bill.\nThe Epilepsy Foundation of America will provide all the necessary coursework, which will be free.\n\u201cIf an adult is in a room and a seizure happens, you can\u2019t wait for a nurse or other medical personnel,\u201d Abbey Roudebush, senior manager of government relations and advocacy at the Epilepsy Foundation of America, told Capital News Service.\nThe foundation has sponsored numerous bills in states across the country, as a part of its Seizure Safe Schools Initiative.\nFive states \u2014 Kentucky, Indiana, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois \u2014 have already passed similar legislation, and 18 others have bills pending that could address the same issue.\nAs of 2020, approximately 59,900 people in Maryland are living with epilepsy, of which 7,900 are children, according to a release from the Epilepsy Foundation of Maryland.\nSen. Ronald Young, D-Frederick, the Senate sponsor, said he hopes that this bill would help protect those 7,900.\n\u201cBrynleigh\u2019s Act helps ensure that students with seizure disorders have the resources they need to go to school without fear for their safety,\u201d Young said in a release.\nThe bill also aims to inform students identify signs of a seizure and the appropriate response.\nThere are numerous types of seizures, and they are often mistaken with fainting, or in some cases, simply daydreaming.\n\u201cWe need to know the signs of seizures,\u201d said Diana Briemann, an educator at Anne Arundel County Schools.\nShillinger said she was also concerned about the stigmas surrounding epilepsy.\nPer the American Academy of Pediatrics, seizures are one of the three most common emergencies in schools across America, yet there\u2019s a lack of understanding about them.\nFor young children, especially in school environments, overcoming those stigmas can be difficult.\n\u201cEveryone has something going on. Brynleigh\u2019s is TSC and epilepsy,\u201d Shillinger said.\nA state nursing association supports the legislation, pointing out that not every school in Maryland has a full-time nurse on staff.\n\u201cUntil Maryland can have a full time registered school nurse in every school building all day and every day, it\u2019s important to have measures in place to keep children like Brynleigh\u2026 safe,\u201d said Kristy Gorman, president of the Maryland Association of School Nurses.\nStill, the bill has its skeptics. Numerous state legislators voiced concerns regarding emphasizing seizure disorders over other common conditions, such as diabetes.\n\u201cI like a lot of stuff in this bill and it makes a lot of sense,\u201d Del. Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, said at a virtual hearing Wednesday. \u201cBut I do think it needs some amendments.\u201d\nLuedtke said the Good Samaritan clause in the bill may need clarification as that provision already exists in Maryland.\nShillinger said she\u2019d be open to changes.\nKerr and Young introduced a similar bill last year, but it was put on hold due to the shortened session brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey changed some specifics of the law, opting that only two people at every school need to be trained in seizure response \u2014 a shift from last year\u2019s proposal that every teacher had to be educated immediately.\nIf passed, it would take effect in the 2022-23 academic year.\n\u201cWe just want her and others to be able to be safe,\u201d Shillinger said.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Maryland high schools may soon be required to adopt a curriculum on gambling addiction, depending on the fate of one bill in the state legislature.\nSB0243, sponsored by Sen. Bryan Simonaire, R-Anne Arundel, directs the Maryland State Department of Education to develop a program for local schools to teach high school students the dangers of gambling.\nLocal school districts would have the option to use an existing gambling curriculum or to establish a new curriculum, according to Simonaire.\n\u201cFrom a governmental policy standpoint, the state receives money from gambling revenues that can be used to help other priorities in our state, but also adversely enables many citizens to become gambling addicts, which creates other issues for the state,\u201d he told Capital News Service.\nSimonaire cited numerous studies in arguing the need for required education on the risks of gambling.\nMultiple studies have shown that people aged 18 to 34 are at the highest risk of developing a gambling addiction.\nThe risk of gambling addiction is higher among those in lower socioeconomic classes and increases the earlier they begin gambling in adolescence, according to the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, in Australia.\nThe Maryland Health Department raises revenue to treat gambling addiction through the Problem Gambling Fund.\nAnnual payments of $425 per slot machine and $500 per table game go to this fund every year, according to Maryland law.\nSimonaire expressed support for these funds but said there should be a greater focus on educating young people before they get addicted.\nSimonaire proposed a similar bill last year that was passed nearly unanimously by the Senate but was not voted on in the House of Delegates due to the early ending of the legislative session amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis year\u2019s bill is identical to the amended version from last year, according to Simonaire.\n\u201cI have worked extremely hard to provide consensus among the stakeholders,\u201d he told Capital News Service. \u201cAt this point, I believe there won\u2019t be any opposition to the bill this year.\u201d\nTwo lawmakers opposed Simonaire\u2019s bill last year: Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s, and Sen. Cheryl Kagan, D-Montgomery.\nKagan told Capital News Service that she will oppose the bill again this year.\n\u201cIt is a widely held philosophy that the state should not mandate curriculum requirements on our 24 local school systems,\u201d she told Capital News Service. \u201cOur Local Boards of Education were elected to represent their communities and are best equipped to decide the curriculum for students in their county.\u201d\nPinsky, who is the chair of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee, did not respond for comment on whether he will oppose the bill again.\nSimonaire told the committee during a Wednesday meeting that the Maryland Association of Boards of Education will no longer be opposing his bill as it did last year.\n\nHowever, there is still hesitation from some local school districts to adopt a statewide required curriculum.\nThe Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners and Anne Arundel County Public School system each had a spokesperson testify against the bill last year.\nA spokesperson for each group told Capital News Service that they will continue to oppose the bill this year.\nThe Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners provided Capital News Service with its written testimony against this year\u2019s bill, stating that the school system does not want a new, mandated curriculum to take time away from other health topics such as opioids, abuse, consent, and healthy eating.\nMaryland has a deep history of gambling that goes back to the local popularity of the centuries-old tradition of horse racing.\nHorse racing became legal in Maryland in 1870 and regulations were established in 1912, according to Maryland Matters.\nRegulation of modern forms of gambling have been established in recent decades: The state lottery was approved in 1972 and casinos in 2008.\nMaryland voters approved of legalized sports betting on the ballot in November via Question 2 with the implication that the government revenue goes to education.\nSimonaire told the Capital News Service that he hopes for his bill to be voted on in the Senate by the end of January.\nIf passed, the local curriculums will begin being taught in the 2022\u20132023 school year, according to the bill.",

    "summary": "Katherine Banegas-Bonilla, a 17-year-old high school student, has taken on extensive household and caregiving responsibilities due to the pandemic, balancing her education with managing her home and assisting younger relatives. This situation is common among eldest children in families where parents must work outside the home during the public health crisis, highlighting the need for emotional and academic support for these adolescents.",
    "content": "BALTIMORE \u2014 A year ago, Katherine Banegas-Bonilla, 17, had to worry only about managing her classes at Baltimore City College, one of Baltimore\u2019s top high schools. Now, the pandemic has forced her to be a short-order cook, housekeeper, laundry supervisor, tutor, translator, tech consultant, baby-sitter \u2014 actually, a third parent.\nMost days, she\u2019s fine with the work. It\u2019s just how her life is these days.\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest, and I have little cousins so they come to my house, and then I have to help them too,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cThen I have to help my little brother with his work all the time, so sometimes I don\u2019t have time to do my stuff.\u201d \nAcross the country, students face challenges with virtual school, but Katherine is one of the many teenagers who are burdened with additional responsibilities because they are the oldest child. While managing her eight classes, Katherine is also expected to run the house and help her younger relatives, whose first language is Spanish, keep up with their online classes. \n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s stressing because depending on how much school work I get and then the work I have to do at home, it stresses me out,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cSometimes, though, it\u2019s just fine.\u201d \nKatherine\u2019s mother, Nancy, works at a candy factory.  Her father, Santos, is a construction worker. During the week, Katherine is left in charge of their East Baltimore home. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that elder siblings are shouldering more responsibilities at home during this public health crisis,\u201d said Tammi Fleming, senior associate at the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a Baltimore-based national philanthropy that focuses on child and family well-being. \n\u201cThis is especially the case for families where the parents must work outside of the home,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd though these young people are stepping up to the plate and pitching in with caring for their siblings, it\u2019s important that they have the emotional and academic support they need for their own studies and personal needs. They need to be cared for, too.\u201d\nNatasha Escobar, a Spanish teacher at City College, has heard from her students that balancing household and academic responsibilities has been challenging. Back in the spring, when school first moved online, Escobar had students tell her that they were the oldest in their households and were expected to take care of their younger siblings.\n\u201cI think a lot of kids feel very overwhelmed right now, and everybody is coping differently,\u201d Escobar said. She has seen more of her students struggle with anxiety, depression and isolation because of the pandemic. \nKatherine says she has not faced those problems, though her schedule leaves her worn out. And the virtual class format, combined with her household responsibilities, have impaired her schoolwork.\nBaltimore City College has high standards, and Katherine\u2019s middle school assistant principal urged her to go there. It is the only high school in the city to offer the rigorous International Baccalaureate (IB) program from ninth through 12th grade, and all students are required to take IB classes. In May, Katherine will graduate and receive her high school diploma. She also will have completed 27 college credits\nBut getting through school has become harder since classes have gone virtual.\nKatherine said she used to get a lot more work done when she went to school in person. Now, she tends to push off assignments.\n\u201cRight now, I feel like sometimes when it\u2019s really late, I\u2019m tired,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cI should just do the work tomorrow, so I wait, and then I get all of these assignments overdue.\u201d \nHer Spanish teacher, Franca Muller Paz, noticed that Katherine missed some deadlines during the second quarter.\n\u201cShe is the person making sure all her siblings are doing what they need to do, making sure that they\u2019re able to be connected,\u201d Muller Paz said. \u201c I think there\u2019s a lot of her kind of sacrificing her own academics to make sure that her younger siblings have everything they need, and that\u2019s really been who Katherine is for a long time.\u201d\nKatherine\u2019s brother Brayan, who is just a year younger, only has to keep his room clean and do his own laundry.  She has been given many more tasks. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a girl,\u201d Katherine said. \nAt City College, Katherine takes four 60-minute classes each day. This year, she\u2019s taking Spanish, physics, history, theory of knowledge, English, social anthropology, math analysis and an extracurricular class that alternates between photography and SOMOS, Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society. \nShe failed three of her classes in the second quarter, which doesn\u2019t doom her chances of graduation. If classes were in person, she thinks she would have performed better. \n \u201cIt\u2019s hard for you to explain to your teacher and show them what you are thinking and what they are thinking,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cLet\u2019s say you ask a question and then she tries to answer it, but when she tries to do so, she gets questions from other students. She doesn\u2019t [end up] answering the question.\u201d \nOne of the classes she failed was English. English has always been a challenging subject for Katherine. She was born in Honduras and moved to the U.S. when she was 11. She quickly became her parents personal translator. \n\u201cMy parents actually started taking me to the store and I was the one who was supposed to pay for stuff,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cThey were always like, you need to practice your English, and now I\u2019m their personal translator,\u201d Katherine said. \nThat was just the beginning of her obligations. Today, she has many more.\n5 a.m. \nKatherine\u2019s alarm goes off. Her father and brothers, Elvis, 8, and Brayan, are still cozied up in their beds. She meets her mother in the kitchen so they can start making her father\u2019s lunch, which some days is chicken and rice.  \nBoth of them are still half asleep, so the conversation is limited.\nAt 6 a.m., after her father\u2019s meal is packed away, Katherine\u2019s mother heads for work. Katherine has coffee ready for her father when he is up and getting ready to leave too.\nEvery other day, Katherine tackles her family\u2019s laundry. She also takes the time to tidy up the house and make sure she has finished all her assignments before school starts. She doesn\u2019t always have the energy to finish them at night. \n8:30 a.m.\nAt least three days a week, a cousin who lives nearby drops her four younger siblings off at Katherine\u2019s house for the day so Katherine can help them navigate virtual learning.\nThe oldest cousin is in sixth grade, and the youngest is in first. The cousins recently immigrated from Honduras, and now the families live just a 10-minute walk away from one another in the East Baltimore neighborhood of  Ellwood Park/Monument.\n\u201cWe all grew up together back in Honduras, so it\u2019s like we\u2019ve always had that connection,\u201d Katherine said. \nThey gather at Katherine\u2019s house because Wi-Fi is stronger there but mostly because the children need a translator. Many Baltimore households don\u2019t have a reliable internet connection that is crucial for online education. According to a 2018 report by the Abell Foundation, 40.7% of Baltimore households did not have wireline internet service.\nBefore the cousins arrive, Katherine sets up their work stations, strategically placing the youngest closest to her and Katherine\u2019s 16-year-old brother and making sure no one is sitting next to someone who might distract them.\n\u201cI know how to separate them,\u201d Katherine said. \nIf the cousins haven\u2019t eaten, Katherine makes something for breakfast before it is time to log onto Google Classroom. It takes her nearly half an hour \u2013 about five minutes for each cousin and her 8-year-old brother \u2013 to get them into their Zoom classes.\nSchool starts for all of them at 9 a.m. Her cousins begin asking for help when their teachers ask them to sign into other applications. Sometimes Katherine has to text their teachers to get codes and log-in information for the cousins while she is in the middle of her own classes.\nAll seven students use their own laptops and the same Wi-Fi connection. The sheer number of devices connected to the internet can cause it to glitch and slow down. \nOne day, Katherine was taking a test in her physics class when the Zoom call dropped. The word \u201creconnecting\u201d appeared on her screen, but her call never reconnected. The Wi-Fi had gone out in her neighborhood.\n\u201cSo I was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh. What do I do now?\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Katherine said. \u201cSo I emailed my teacher, and I told him there was an outage in my area.\u201d Her teacher was sympathetic and allowed her to use extra time at the end of the day to finish.\n11:20 a.m.\nKatherine\u2019s classes pause for lunch. She usually eats what\u2019s left from the meal she packed for her father that morning. \nAt 12:10, it\u2019s time for Katherine to go back to class. This would be easy enough except for the fact that her cousins\u2019 lunch period starts at noon. The kids bring lunch at least two times a week, but on the days they don\u2019t, Katherine must make something for them. On Fridays, however, Katherine opts to order pizza for herself, siblings and cousins instead of cooking.\nShe enters the kitchen, using her phone to stay connected with class. Wearing headphones, she moves around, heating up soup for the children.\nIf the soup is ready before the cousins are allowed to take a lunch break, she sometimes has to reheat it.\nKatherine knew nothing about cooking until she moved to the U.S. Her mother thought she at least knew how to make rice, but on her first attempt she ended up burning it.\n3:00 p.m.\nWhen school is over., Katherine asks her cousins and younger brother what they have for homework. If they have questions, they opt to stay at Katherine\u2019s to complete their lessons, as she is the translator. \nThen Katherine rounds them up, makes sure they have their devices and bookbags and walks them to their house. Katherine would have had her driver\u2019s license by now and would have been able to drive them home if the virus had not shut down her driving school.\nThere are days when Katherine doesn\u2019t want to have these responsibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s those days where I don\u2019t get enough sleep,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to do this like I do.\u201d\nOn those days, Katherine warns the kids to disturb her as little as possible. She also asks Brayan for help, or if she\u2019s having a particularly stressful day, she tells her 18-year-old cousin, Saira, she needs her to be there during the school day. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Please, I need your help today,\u2019 \u201d Katherine said. \u201cI am not so good.\u201d  \n5:30 p.m.\nKatherine makes dinner for the family.  But even when Nancy Bonilla-Galo gets home on time, Katherine is still expected to help out in the kitchen. Some evenings, her father works late, so the rest of the family may wait until 8 p.m. for dinner.\nThen she washes the dishes and cleans up the kitchen before she heads upstairs to do her homework.\n11 p.m. \nOn nights where she has a lot of homework to do, Katherine goes to bed between midnight and 1 a.m. On those that she doesn\u2019t, she goes to sleep around 11 p.m. Her alarm will ring at 5 the next morning.\nTaking a break\nFor Thanksgiving, Katherine and her family traveled to Manassas, Virginia, to spend the holiday with her aunt. Her mother suggested that Katherine and her siblings stay there for a couple of weeks and do their schooling while away from home.\n\u201cMy mom wanted us to take a break from school because we were stressed out, especially me,\u201d Katherine said. But the relief from her responsibilities didn\u2019t completely alleviate her stress. She missed her routine at home. By the second week of December, she was back home in East Baltimore.\nKatherine\u2019s parents have tried to stress the importance of college. They believe it will allow her to get a better job and give her more opportunities. But because of the pressure of her obligations, Katherine said she wants a break, a year off. She may not want to go to college at all.  \nHer parents think it will be a major regret if she decides not to go. If she does go, she said she would like to major in nursing or business.\nAnd if she had that business degree, she says she would consider traveling back to Honduras to assist her grandparents with their business, a coffee plantation that Katherine says that doesn\u2019t make a lot of money as \u201cprices are really low.\u201d\nKatherine does not want to stay in the United States for a long time. \u201cI hate it here,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cI just want to go back.\u201d It\u2019s been six years, and she said she still hasn\u2019t adjusted to life in the States.\nThat decision is months away. For now, Katherine is focused on managing her responsibilities and finishing her senior year.",

    "summary": "During the pandemic, libraries in Washington D.C. and Maryland adapted to limited capacity operations, providing essential resources while suspending in-person group activities and browsing.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged \u2014 but before everything truly shut down \u2014 Elyse Kovalsky\u2019s first stop was the Mt. Pleasant Library on 16th Street in Northwest Washington.\n\u201cWhen everyone else was freaking out and going to buy toilet paper, I freaked out and went to the library,\u201d said Kovalsky, 39, an employee at a non-profit in the city.\n\u201cI got as many books as I could physically carry, and I remember walking home and they, at some point on 19th Street, all fell out of my hands,\u201d she said. But at\u00a0that moment, going to the library \u201cfelt like the most important thing.\u201d\nSince the closure of many businesses and operations in March, many libraries in both the District of Columbia and Maryland have reopened and are now running at limited capacity. The revamped operations have introduced significant challenges and opportunities for libraries and their patrons.\nMaryland Library Association President Morgan Miller referred to libraries as \u201ca really important touchstone\u201d for many patrons.\nAccording to Pew Research Center survey data from 2016, more than half of respondents indicated that libraries helped them get information that helps with making decisions, grow as a person, learn new things and find information that is trustworthy and reliable.\nLibraries also provide crucial resources, such as educational materials, computer access and even shelter to their communities. In this way, Miller described libraries as acting as a form of \u201csocial safety net.\u201d\nThe DC Public Library system shut down mid-March and entered Phase Two mid-summer. Of the 26 public libraries,18 are open and running on a limited basis, while eight remain closed.\nFor the libraries running on a limited basis, all in-person group programs, such as children\u2019s storytelling sessions, have been put on hiatus. In addition, patrons cannot browse books inside the library, sit at a table or lounge area, copy or scan materials, or use the meeting or study rooms.\nDespite these restrictions, DC Public Library spokesman George Williams noted that patrons are still able to come in to pick up books that they have on hold, apply for library cards, send documents electronically for free printing, borrow from a curated selection of book titles available for checkout near the circulation desk, and use a computer \u2014 although the number of public computers available has decreased.\nIn the state of Maryland, there are 24 public library systems \u2014 one for each of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties, as well as one for Baltimore City \u2014 and each is operating in accordance with its own reopening plan.\nLibraries in some counties, such as Cecil County, have recently begun to reopen some branches with limited capacity, social distancing and safety protocols.\nIn the library systems of counties where the state has consistently been reporting the highest COVID-19 caseloads, such as Prince George\u2019s County and Montgomery County, all buildings remain closed to the public.\nMost branches in Prince George\u2019s County Memorial Library System and Montgomery County Public Libraries have been offering appointment-based outdoor pickup for holds placed online or over the phone.\nLibraries are placing a greater emphasis on their virtual opportunities, which they say have flourished in the wake of the initial COVID-19 lockdown.\nBefore curbside services and limited reopenings, patrons were essentially limited to checking out electronic materials from online resources, such as the Overdrive digital content library, so electronic media have seen significantly more traction with patrons.\nFrom mid-March to mid-November, the DC Public Library saw a 34% increase in checkouts and a 81% increase in holds over the numbers from the same period last year on Overdrive, Williams said in an email.\nThe digital transition has also led many libraries across the District of Columbia and Maryland to transition previously in-person programs like book clubs and children\u2019s storytelling sessions to online platforms such as Zoom and Discord.\nIn addition, Miller said that many libraries introduced new programming \u2014 often video sessions that teach viewers skills for managing daily life amid a pandemic, such as preparing restaurant-quality meals and promoting literacy in homebound children.\n\u201cWe saw this huge rapid rollout and proliferation of really high-quality virtual programming,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIn some ways, while our physical spaces got smaller and much more constrained, we became much more expansive, and in these online worlds, we ended up connecting with people in the community who we never had before.\u201d\nWhile these transitions to online programming may have seemed smooth for patrons, they required attention to detail for library staff \u2014 \u201cprogram by program, need by need, figuring out how we want to do it,\u201d said David Quick, the DC Public Library\u2019s coordinator of adult programs and partnerships.\nMany libraries have gone \u201cfine free,\u201d either temporarily or permanently, to minimize barriers to community use.\nMontgomery County Public Libraries advertises on its website that its library fines are \u201ccurrently suspended.\u201d\nPrince George\u2019s County Memorial Library System, meanwhile, committed to becoming \u201cfine free\u201d on July 1, noting in a press release its intent to ensure that \u201call Prince Georgians have equitable access to the Library\u2019s resources and services, while eliminating the financial barrier of overdue fines.\u201d\nAs for the District, more than 4,000 library cards were unblocked and more than 87,000 cards that had expired since April 2017 were restored, Williams said.\n\u201cOne of the things that the library has been doing for several years is, we have been systematically removing barriers,\u201d he added.\nMany patrons have shown an increased interest in learning about anti-racism \u2014 particularly after Minneapolis police officers arrested and killed George Floyd on May 25 \u2014 and libraries have been striving to help.\nWilliams said that DC Public Library data shows the top titles between mid-March and early November were \u201cWhite Fragility: Why It\u2019s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,\u201d by Robin DiAngelo, and \u201cSo You Want to Talk about Race,\u201d by Ijeoma Oluo.\nThe DC Public Library now offers unlimited eBook and audiobook copies of limited titles on race.\nSeeing a similar interest in Prince George\u2019s County, the library system there partnered with local agencies and nonprofits to host a virtual event in July featuring \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist\u201d author Dr. Ibram X. Kendi.\nThe event attracted more than 226,000 live views, according to the library\u2019s COO for communication and outreach, Nicholas Brown.\nSome patrons also have taken more time to explore genres that are new to them.\nBefore COVID-19, Kovalsky said she would stop in at least once a month, pick up books, browse the shelves with her two kids, or attend the weekend activities. Now she makes monthly pickups, but her tastes have shifted. Kovalsky said she had not read a book for pleasure in years, but recently began reading \u201cThe Refugees,\u201d a non-fiction book by Viet Thanh Nguyen.\nAriana Dugan, 33, vice president of product and enterprise at General Assembly, said she has been using the Mt. Pleasant Library more often since the beginning of the pandemic because \u201cit\u2019s a nice alternative to screen time for work.\u201d\nDugan said she also enjoys newfound efficiency: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more transactional, because I go online to sign the book, order it, and then just pick it up at the library rather than having that kind of browsing experience, and I don\u2019t super mind that honestly.\u201d\nShe has also discovered a love of non-fiction.\n\u201cThings that take me out of the here-and-now but are still in one way or another grounded in reality, I would say is a common theme in terms of what I\u2019ve been getting from the library,\u201d she said.\nFor some people, despite the libraries\u2019 enhanced cleaning protocols and changes, COVID-19 remains a concern.\nJulie Locascio, an attorney and long-time Washington resident, told Capital News Service that since the beginning of the pandemic she has only picked up one book from the library and has been very careful to minimize human exposure.\nDespite this, she wrote in a social media message to CNS, \u201cI have been super grateful at how many books I have been able to borrow electronically from the library.\u201d\nNot everybody knows the libraries are open.\nThe District library and city government have been providing updates through newsletters, government messages and notices.\nEven so, Kovalsky has come across several people who did not know the library was open during her walks to or from the library.\nThey would see her carrying books and ask her, \u201cYou\u2019re going to the library? Why are you going to the library? How is that even open?!,\u201d Kovalsky said.\nMiller said the pandemic-related closures may have made people realize that their libraries have much to offer.\n\u201cPeople were never aware as we wanted or needed them to be about just how much value and service the library brings to the community,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNobody thinks about it until it\u2019s gone. I think not having a library as they know it brought to the forefront of their mind how much they miss it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's public schools initially adopted varied approaches to reopening in response to COVID-19, with many planning hybrid models; however, rising case rates have since compelled most districts to shift to fully virtual learning. While some parents and officials support the gradual return to classrooms, others criticize the rushed reopening efforts for not adequately addressing the needs of vulnerable students.",
    "content": "As COVID-19 cases rise throughout the state of Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan\u2019s urgent tone has prompted nearly all school districts currently practicing hybrid learning to close their doors to students this fall.\nBack in August, state officials left the decision of whether to reopen largely up to individual county education executives. The state only advised that schools should consider limiting in-person instruction or close if their county\u2019s positivity rate exceeded 5 percent and the new case rate was over 15 cases per 100,000.\nAs a result, each county made its own plans for how to handle reopening and online learning. However, steep case rates have recently forced most schools to go fully virtual.\nMost school systems opened for some form of in-person learning\nWhile the beginning of the school year started out virtual for all Maryland public school districts, most counties originally had plans in place to switch to hybrid learning prior to January 2021 and many were able to welcome select groups of students back.\nSome school districts made the transition earlier than others. Washington and Worcester counties returned some students to schools as early as September, with other districts, like Kent and Harford, following suit in October and November.\n\u201cOverall, the feedback we have received has been that families have appreciated our efforts to bring back all students who wish to return to the classroom,\u201d Louis Taylor, Worcester Superintendent of Schools, wrote in an email.\nSome parents, however, have not been satisfied with the approach schools have taken to bring students back. Kristen DeBoy Caminiti, a mother in Anne Arundel County and member of the AACPS Superintendent\u2019s Parent Involvement Advisory Council, believes that schools are reopening hastily and are failing to prioritize children in need.\n\u201cI want schools open for the kids who need it, but I refuse to make everybody sacrifice negatively for a plan that is not serving anyone\u2019s needs well,\u201d Caminiti said. \u201cEquity is tailoring our approach to the individual needs of each child and not every child needs the same thing in order to have an equal chance of succeeding.\u201d\nFor Wicomico County Superintendent Donna Hanlin, parent feedback has been mixed. In the end, it was just about making the best collective decision possible.\n\u201cWe knew [starting out virtual] wouldn\u2019t make everyone happy, but we believed it served in everyone\u2019s best interests for health and safety reasons, while also providing instructional consistency for both students and teachers,\u201d Hanlin wrote in an email. \u201cAs for reactions from parents to students returning via hybrid model, it has been mostly positive, although a lot of parents also made the decision to keep their children at home because of COVID-19 health concerns.\u201d\nOf the counties that decided to engage in hybrid instruction, some began phasing students in based on grade level. Wicomico County invited Pre-Kindergarten students back on Oct. 19 and Kindergarten on Oct. 26, planning for other grades to return in the following weeks.\nA few school districts had students attend in person on alternate days. Talbot County Public Schools had students in Pre-K through Grade 5 return on Oct. 12 with an \u2018AA/BB\u2019 schedule, where students are scheduled to come in person on either Monday and Tuesday or Thursday and Friday. Wednesday was set as an asynchronous day for all students, with the same protocol kicking in for high school students on Oct. 19.\nWhile making these complex decisions, school districts have had to consider students\u2019 home lives and access to an internet connection, nutritious meals and other educational and technical resources.\nAccording to ProPublica, some Baltimore City students were experiencing difficult living situations that made navigating virtual learning environments difficult or impossible. To combat food insecurity, school districts in many Maryland counties are offering free bagged meals for pickup at numerous school sites.\nSome schools have already set a return date\nHigh positivity rates of COVID-19 have soared across Maryland in the past several weeks. Statewide, the positivity rate has risen above seven percent in recent days and has continued to climb, according to Maryland\u2019s COVID-19 Data Dashboard on Maryland.gov \u2014 reporting an 8% 7-day average positivity rate as of Dec. 3.\nState data updated Dec. 2 shows that schools across Maryland have experienced outbreak-associated cases in schools. Grace Academy in Washington County currently tops the list with 19 total positive cases, with the Glenelg Country School in Howard County and the Bullis School in Montgomery County following behind with 11 and 10 positive cases, respectively. \n\nWhile almost all Maryland school systems announced in November that they\u2019re going all virtual, some of them made the call sooner. Dorchester County was among the first counties in the state to shut back down at the end of October after Health Officer Roger Harrell announced that test-positivity rates in the county went from 2.9% to 6.1% in an eight-day period.\nSome school systems have already set dates for when they anticipate bringing students back into the classroom.\nPublic school districts like Worcester and Carroll are aiming to reopen for in-person learning in early January. Worcester aims to reopen on Jan. 4 and Carroll County has set Jan. 7 as a tentative date.\n\u201cWe recognize the importance of our students being able to return to the classroom environment, but the health and safety of our students and staff is always our top priority,\u201d said Taylor, Worcester\u2019s Superintendent.\nA few school districts are projecting a later start for in-person learning due to safety concerns. Howard County Board of Education has extended virtual learning for its school districts through mid-April at the earliest.\nLavanya Sithanandam, a mother in Montgomery County and local pediatrician, noted feeling disappointed in the Montgomery County Public School district\u2019s approach to instruction delivery.\n\u201cI think Montgomery County Public Schools has failed my patients, especially my minority patients, by not releasing a plan earlier,\u201d Sithanandam said. \u201cWe have documented a 30% increase in mental health referrals in our practice since March. A lot of children are coming in with symptoms of depression, anxiety, even suicide attempts relating to social isolation.\u201d\nJessica Hasson, a mother in Montgomery County and local psychologist, shared similar sentiments. Hasson noted that students are overwhelmed by virtual learning and stated that students with disabilities and younger children should be prioritized for hybrid education.\n\u201c[Young children] are not designed to sit in front of a computer\u2026 Mentally, emotionally, cognitively \u2014 it\u2019s not where they are developmentally,\u201d Hasson said. \u201cWe have the equity hubs, we have the educational hubs, right in the school buildings\u2026 We can use what [the schools] have done and have done successfully to bring in small groups.\u201d\nMaryland has recently surpassed 200,000 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, and on Dec 2, the state reported the most COVID-19 deaths since June.\nOn Dec. 1, Hogan held a press conference to comment on the rising numbers and ask for more medical professionals to step up to work at hospitals as capacity rose by 51 percent in two weeks.\nTowards the end of last month, Hogan ordered bars to close early, limited capacity at hospitals and nursing homes and banned fans from stadiums \u2014 all changes that went into effect Nov. 20.\n\u201cThis is not the flu. It\u2019s not fake news. It\u2019s not going to magically disappear just because we\u2019re all tired of it and we want our normal lives back,\u201d Hogan said on Nov. 17, during the time when many schools began to close back down. \u201cWe are in a war right now and the virus is winning.\u201d",

    "summary": "Kimberly Vasquez and Dawn Vanmeter's families in Baltimore and rural Allegany County, respectively, face significant challenges with inadequate internet bandwidth and connectivity, hindering their ability to participate effectively in remote learning. These cases highlight the broader issue of digital inequality affecting many Maryland households during the pandemic.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 After Kimberly Vasquez\u2019s two younger sisters log into their virtual classrooms from their Baltimore home, there\u2019s barely enough bandwidth left for the high school senior to get into her class.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant conflict and battle, trying to get connected, trying to learn,\u201d the 17-year-old Vasquez said.\nHer family has Comcast Internet Essentials, a low-cost broadband plan for low-income households that promises no more than the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s minimum bandwidth for high-speed internet. But FCC guidelines caution that if several users are on a network simultaneously, the bandwidth that Internet Essentials provides may not be sufficient for video streaming on multiple devices.\nThe college-bound student said watching her grades fall because of remote-learning obstacles is \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and makes her feel \u201clike a failure.\u201d\nAcross the state in rural Allegany County, the mountains on either side of Dawn Vanmeter\u2019s home block a cell signal from reaching her family\u2019s school-issued hotspot, a device the size of a cell phone that acts as a WiFi router. \nSo each day, Vanmeter stuffs a backpack with books, supplies, a computer and snacks before driving her two granddaughters, Abby, 8, and Ayedann, 10, just a few miles away to her son\u2019s house atop a hill.\n\u201cHe has better access to the cellphone tower than I do,\u201d she said.\nHigh school senior Kimberly Vasquez sits in front of her laptop in her Baltimore home. The 17-year-old senior struggles to access her online classroom because the family\u2019s low-cost broadband plan, Comcast Internet Essentials, does not provide the bandwidth for her and her two sisters to stream teleconferencing applications at the same time. Courtesy photo/Kimberly Vasquez\nThese families live in two of the most digitally disadvantaged parts of Maryland, and are just an example of the thousands of households who have lacked the equipment or the internet access to attend virtual school during the pandemic. \nState officials since 2018 have been addressing rural access issues where broadband infrastructure does not yet exist. But lawmakers who say progress has been too slow are already earmarking legislation that would address statewide broadband access. \nIn both Baltimore City and Allegany County, the number of households without a broadband connection hovers around 40%, but usually not for the same reasons.\nAllegany County residents are hamstrung by topography that blocks cell signals, and a population density too low to justify the investment of broadband providers. \nIn Baltimore, broadband infrastructure is plentiful. But urban connectivity often comes down to affordability, according to state officials and city stakeholders. Broadband capacity may also be a culprit.\nThe burden of the state\u2019s digital deficit landed on the shoulders of school districts in March when schools transitioned to remote learning. And to keep children \u201cin school,\u201d officials across Maryland had to act fast to get computers and internet service to those without.\nStill for some, the Vasquez sisters and Vanmeter\u2019s granddaughters, the tools provided are inadequate to give them a virtual ride to school.\nThe chief information technology officer of Allegany County Public Schools, Nil Grove, said she and her team gave out 8,000 Chromebooks and 1,300 hotspots to families. But there were still students in the areas around Flintstone, Mount Savage and Old Town, where Vanmeter lives, who do not have the option of high-speed lines, and cannot get a signal through a hotspot.\n\u201cWe tried with most every one of them,\u201d Grove said. \u201cWe tried to see if  \u2018Oh, take the hotspot and put it in this window. Now let\u2019s try it in your bathroom.\u2019 \u201d But Grove said there was nothing more she could do for about 200 students.\n\nAt the end of September, the county bused approximately 25 unable-to-connect elementary and middle schoolers to Flintstone Elementary to use the building as an internet hub. \nVanmeter\u2019s oldest granddaughter joined them. The students connected to virtual class from their socially distant desks in the school gymnasium. Weeks later, the county allowed a few grades at a time to begin hybrid learning, with teachers coming in person to lead classes.\nBut as COVID-19 cases spiked statewide in early November, Allegany County officials sent students back home, including Abby and Ayedann. Wednesday the county reported a case positivity rate of 13.22% \u2014 the highest in the state.\nOne Baltimore technology advocate said addressing the problem takes more data than just knowing where broadband exists and doesn\u2019t exist; it\u2019s about knowing how efficient it is for those who have it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this voiced frustration from within communities that are saying, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting access. We aren\u2019t getting connected, even when we have a connection,\u2019 \u201d said Andrew Coy, the executive director of the Digital Harbor Foundation.\nThe former senior adviser to the Obama administration\u2019s technology and innovation team said the standard minimum FCC delivery speeds internet service providers, like Comcast, boast are inadequate and need updating.\n\u201cThese gaps are chasms, and they are going to have immediate and long-term health implications, educational implications, economic implications,\u201d Coy said.\n\nKristie Fox, vice president of communications for Comcast\u2019s Beltway Region, declined to be interviewed but wrote in an emailed statement: \u201cThe digital divide is a vast and complex problem that requires collaboration \u2013 with the school district, elected officials, nonprofit community partners, and other private-sector companies \u2013 so everyone is part of the solution.\u201d \nThe state so far has invested $14 million in partial grants projected to expand rural broadband to 15,000 households through its Office of Rural Broadband. Gov. Larry Hogan, R, created the office by executive order in 2017 \u201cto provide affordable high-speed internet service to every Maryland home by the year 2022.\u201d\nTo get state funds, jurisdictions, cooperatives or neighborhoods partner with an internet service provider and raise half of the project\u2019s funding through federal grants or in-kind donations. The office grants the funds for the other half.\nDirector Rick Gordon said that even though his office is \u201coff to a good start,\u201d challenges exist, like enticing service providers to expand into broadband deserts. \n\u201cI\u2019m an engineer, given enough time and money, anything\u2019s possible,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThe goal is to make sure that the time is managed and the money is being used appropriately to reach the end result.\u201d\nStill, he said, the office is on track to achieve their goal and to date the governor has given them the annual funds they\u2019ve requested. Gordon said his initial cost projection was $100 million to get broadband to around 71,000 rural unserved households. \nBut that projection is based on an FCC definition that classifies \u201cunserved households\u201d as those without the infrastructure for download speeds above 25 Mbps. Census data shows that, in fact, nearly 200,000 households in rural counties lack a broadband connection, regardless of whether the infrastructure exists.\n\nThe office focuses on the 18 of Maryland\u2019s 24 jurisdictions that are defined by state law as rural, and some rural portions of other counties. No similar state entity exists to tackle urban digital disparities. This year marked the first that the office directed funds into Baltimore in the form of federal pandemic relief grants.\nEconomist Alex Marr\u00e9 said it\u2019s key for states to have a comprehensive approach because broadband provides rural and urban consumers similar economic benefits, like shopping for low-cost goods and accessing healthcare and education. But rural areas are just that much further disadvantaged when it comes to the internet because the infrastructure may not even exist in their area.\n\u201cEven if everybody could afford an internet subscription, there\u2019s just not the fiber laid out there,\u201d said Marr\u00e9, who studies broadband infrastructure as a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, Marr\u00e9 said, has \u201creally just driven home how broadband, which used to be thought of as kind of this luxury 10 years ago; I mean, it is a necessary utility today.\u201d\nMaryland lawmakers interviewed by Capital News Service agreed that a statewide solution is needed and that it\u2019s time to start thinking about the internet as a necessity.\nAllegany County Delegate Jason Buckel, R, said the lack of connectivity is \u201cclearly disadvantaging\u201d his more isolated constituents. The government, he said, should facilitate internet access for all Marylanders as they do roads, water and sewer service.\n\u201cWe need the government to make it possible, and subsidize it to an extent so that the private sector provider could get that high speed internet real real close to our house,\u201d he said.\nDelegate Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, wrote in an email: \u201cState and private actors have been trying different strategies over the years to push connectivity forward, but none of it has been fast enough or comprehensive enough.\u201d\nIn the next Maryland General Assembly, Lierman said she plans to introduce legislation with Sen. Sarah Elfreth, D-Annapolis, to \u201cbroaden the reach and mandate\u201d of the Office of Rural Broadband to address disparities in all 24 jurisdictions, \u201cnot only so that every resident in Maryland can be connected to the internet, but also that every resident in Maryland knows how to use the internet.\u201d\nSen. Katie Fry Hester, D-Carroll and Howard, who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology and Biotechnology, said she will introduce legislation to address the per pupil and school staff member digital costs.\nExpanding the Office of Rural Broadband, Hester said, is important because \u201cneeds change, and the amount of work has changed, and it\u2019s not just rural broadband.\u201d\nPolicy advocates expect to throw their support behind broadband expansion efforts in January\u2019s General Assembly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the big picture, obviously, of how we can move the ball forward,\u201d said Drew Jabin, a policy associate with the Maryland Association of Counties. \nIn the meantime, Vasquez has taken matters into her own hands by becoming a connectivity activist. In partnership with Coy\u2019s Digital Harbor Foundation, she produces a podcast on Baltimore\u2019s internet disparities. \nAnd her student-led advocacy group, Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society, or SOMOS, in May sent a letter to Comcast with a list of demands, including faster speeds and free access for low-income families. \nIn its response, Comcast \u201cwelcomed a partnership\u201d with SOMOS to \u201craise awareness of the Internet Essentials program\u201d to get more Baltimoreans connected to the internet, and detailed assistance they had already established during the pandemic, like canceling late fees and providing two months of free service for new customers.\nVasquez says the mental exhaustion of getting repeatedly \u201ckicked out\u201d of her virtual classroom sometimes makes her want to give up trying to connect.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to remind myself that it\u2019s not because of me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019m not provided with the tools that I need.\u201d",

    "content": "ELLICOTT CITY, Maryland \u2014 Learning has changed in Maryland since the coronavirus outbreak. Teachers and students have been forced to turn to online platforms across all education levels due to the closing of classrooms.\nLast week, the Maryland State Department of Education extended its closure of public school systems through at least May 15.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the right decision for the safety and health of our students, educators, and state,\u201d Maryland State Education Association President Cheryl Bost said, pointing to challenges such as technology access and food insecurity that hamper distance education for some students. \u201cThis type of learning is no substitute for in-person learning, and we will need to be thoughtful and serious about how we help students recover from this crisis.\u201d\nHigher-education institutions within the University System of Maryland and around the state had already moved to online-only at least for the rest of the spring semester.\n\u201cWhat we had to do was really set expectations,\u201d Montgomery County Public Schools spokesman Derek Turner told Capital News Service. \u201cFirst we need to focus on student health and wellness, and then we need to focus on what a new world of instruction looks like.\u201d\nK-12 education faces some of the toughest challenges. There is a wide array of ages and behaviors among students, and varying access to online platforms, according to Turner.\nMontgomery County schools have loaned out more than 43,000 Chromebook laptops to students in order to give them access to the online learning environments, according to Turner.\u00a0\n\u201cThe biggest problem we\u2019re facing is internet connectivity,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking for opportunities to make sure we are closing gaps in the digital divide.\u201d\nMontgomery County Public Schools has been working with Comcast to allow students to access the internet and has been purchasing hotspot devices for those who lack local connections.\u00a0 Lockheed Martin donated $25,000 to the school system toward the purchase of more mobile hotspots, according to Turner.\nKeeping to a schedule can also be a challenge \u2014 for teachers and students.\u00a0\nAnne Arundel County Public Schools, for example, published a suggested daily calendar for students. Each calendar \u2014 for elementary, middle and high school levels \u2014 gave guidance as to how students could tackle their days at home in the online environment.\n\u201cThe notion is that we wanted to build a structure for students that was flexible and provided structure and support for them,\u201d Anne Arundel schools spokesman Bob Mosier said.\nColleges and universities across the state took recommendations from the University System of Maryland, which on March 10 announced they were shutting down campuses and moving classes online. This policy has stayed in place for the remainder of the semester.\u00a0\nMany have attempted to ease pressure on students by implementing campus-wide changes to grading policies. The University of Maryland, College Park implemented a pass/fail system, Towson University implemented its Pass Grading Option and Salisbury University opted for a pass/no pass system.\n\u201cWorking in concert with some of the other University System of Maryland schools, it was determined that, for this semester only, that it would be a good option for some of our students\u201d\nwho have been disrupted by having to take classes online and/or the virus affecting their personal lives, Salisbury University spokesman Jason Rhodes said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe know this is a stressful time for a lot of students, as well as faculty and staff, and we\u2019re always looking to do the right thing for our university community,\u201d Rhodes said.\u00a0\nRhodes also mentioned that Salisbury, and likely other University System of Maryland campuses, had a pandemic plan in place that was drafted when the avian flu and swine flu presented threats in 2008 and 2009, respectively, so the transition was not unforeseen.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve had to put that (plan) into action,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cAnd certainly once this is all over, there\u2019ll be a debrief about what can be done different, what can be done better, next time. But this is something that we prepared for and we\u2019re certainly happy that we did.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland's House Bill 106 aims to ease apprenticeship rules for mortuary science students by allowing them to begin their apprenticeships earlier in their academic programs. The bill passed unanimously in the House of Delegates and is now under review by the Maryland Senate's Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 An emergency bill would deaden the requirement that Maryland mortuary science students must complete the majority of their education prior to starting an apprenticeship.\nHouse bill 106, a bipartisan effort from Delegates Susan Krebs, R-Carroll, and Joseline Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, would allow anyone enrolled in a mortuary science program the ability to begin an apprenticeship.\u00a0\nUnder current law, mortuary science students must have completed at least two-thirds of their academic program with at least a 2.0 GPA in order to begin an apprenticeship program.\u00a0\nAn apprentice currently must complete at least 1,000 working hours under the direction of an apprentice sponsor in a licensed funeral establishment, according to a state report. Those hoping to become funeral directors must also take part in 20 funerals, while those aiming to become a mortician must participate in the embalming of 20 human bodies under supervision. These requirements would not change.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are having an issue where people can\u2019t start their apprenticeship until they finish school,\u201d Krebs said. There are clear benefits to students being able to gain work experience while learning, she said.\u00a0\nAccording to Mark Bailey of the Maryland Board of Morticians, there are 50 active mortician apprentices and 120 students enrolled in the state\u2019s only certified program \u2014 at the Community College of Baltimore County, Catonsville.\nThe changes that this bill ushers in would hopefully raise the number of active apprentices from 50 to more than 100, according to Bailey.\nHouse bill 106 passed through the House of Delegates on Feb. 27 by a vote of 134-0. It has since crossed over to the Maryland Senate and been referred to the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee. That committee has not yet voted on the measure. If passed, the emergency legislation would go into effect immediately.\u00a0\nAs of May 2018, there were approximately 410 morticians, undertakers and funeral directors in the state of Maryland, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cThis (bill) expands opportunities for students who are in mortuary science school,\u201d said attorney Jim Doyle, representing the Maryland State Funeral Directors Association, at a Health and Government Operations Committee hearing on Feb. 4. \u201cIt allows them to earn money. It allows them to gain more experience.\u201d\nDoyle added that the requirement of completing two-thirds of the educational program before gaining field experience \u201cdeprives (students) of the opportunity to know if they like and want to actually be a funeral director.\u201d\u00a0\nThis bill would allow students to figure out their feelings toward the profession earlier, save time and money, as well as make money while in school, according to Doyle.",

    "summary": "A Maryland bill proposes requiring colleges to clearly outline course material costs in their catalogs, initiated by student concerns over unexpected expenses. The bill aims to enhance transparency and support better financial decision-making for students, though it faces some opposition from university representatives who view it as redundant.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Maryland universities, colleges and community colleges would have to clearly outline free and lower-cost course materials, along with textbook and other fees associated with a course, in the institution\u2019s catalog, per a bill under the Maryland General Assembly, should it pass.\nThe idea came out of a University of Maryland Student Government Association meeting, according to the group\u2019s director of government affairs, Samay Kindra, who pitched the idea to the House sponsor of the bill, Delegate Vaughn Stewart, D-Montgomery.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for money or anything, we\u2019re asking for information,\u201d Kindra, a senior international business and economics major at the University of Maryland, told Capital News Service last week.\nKindra said that many students register for classes not knowing how much they will actually be spending on the course. He used himself as an example: \u201cI\u2019m dropping close to a thousand dollars on materials,\u201d adding that he didn\u2019t know he would have to do so beforehand.\nColleges and universities under the University System of Maryland would be required to publicize which courses would provide students with free digital course materials, and may provide access to low-cost print options to students as an alternative, according to the bill\u2019s legislative analysis.\nThe process may require a one-time programming cost in fiscal year 2021 for the update in course catalog, though the costs have not been estimated, according to the state analysis.\nBy spreading information to students and faculty, Kindra said, it\u2019ll encourage faculty to adopt free or low-cost course materials going forward.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind this is to give students more information so that they can make better financial decisions for themselves,\u201d said Kindra.\nThe bill faced opposition at its House hearing on Feb. 11, with a representative of the university system calling the bill\u2019s intention \u201cduplicative\u201d of the policies currently in place, but supporting the bill\u2019s idea and implementation of open educational resources, an idea that encourages instructors to mix-and-match free or low-cost materials.\nThe Senate version of the bill, 667, has bipartisan support with lead sponsor Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, and co-sponsor, Justin Ready, R-Carroll, saying that the bill would basically be \u201ctruth in advertising.\u201d\nA similar measure was passed in Oregon in 2015, in order to make material more affordable and accessible to students, Kindra said.\nKindra said that the Student Government Association is in the process of trying to push lawmakers in voting in favor of the bill by sending them emails.\nNeither the House nor the Senate committee has yet voted on the legislation.",

    "summary": "Maryland lawmakers anticipate education reform, school construction, gun safety, and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to be key issues in the 2020 legislative session. New leadership, including Sen.",
    "content": "*32nd paragraph of story has been updated to reflect that upcoming legislation will require local permission for toll roads. \nANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Reforming Maryland\u2019s public education system. Building new schools. Addressing gun safety. Funding the state\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. These are some of the issues that Maryland state lawmakers expect to dominate the 2020 General Assembly session.\nWhen legislators return to Annapolis in early January, much will be different.\nThere will be new committee assignments. With multiple lawmakers having resigned during the fall, there will be new faces at the State House.\nBoth chambers will also likely have new leaders for the first time in years. The Senate Democratic Caucus unanimously tapped Sen. Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore, to succeed Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., D-Calvert, Charles and Prince George\u2019s, in 2020. Miller, the Senate president for more than three decades, has been battling cancer and announced in October that he is giving up his gavel next month but remaining in the General Assembly.\nThis will also be the first full session as speaker of the House for Delegate Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County. After the death of longtime Speaker Michael Busch in April, Jones emerged as his successor following a scarring fight among House Democrats that nearly saw their Republican counterparts essentially naming the next speaker.\nJones told Capital News Service in an interview that she\u2019s been \u201call over the state\u201d and in \u201cback-to-back meetings\u201d to prepare for her first full session as speaker. She said she will be a \u201cfair\u201d but \u201cno-nonsense\u201d leader.\nDelegate Kathy Szeliga, R-Baltimore and Harford Counties, told Capital News Service that she is \u201cvery excited\u201d about Jones leading the House. Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Baltimore and Howard Counties, said Ferguson will bring a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d to the Senate. Sen. Arthur Ellis, D-Charles, said both new leaders represent a \u201cgenerational shift\u201d for the General Assembly.\nThe General Assembly will have a number of priorities for the three-month session \u2014 likely none bigger than determining how to fund recommendations from a special commission that had been studying over the past few years how to transform Maryland\u2019s public education system.\nDuring its final meeting in November, the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education \u2014 referred to as the Kirwan Commission after its chair, William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan \u2014 voted to advance its plan that would phase in increased education funding over the next 10 fiscal years. In fiscal year 2030, direct state aid would exceed $10.2 billion, which is $2.8 billion \u201cmore than would be allocated under current law,\u201d according to the commission\u2019s proposal.\nThe commission\u2019s recommendations on improving education in the state include increasing teacher salaries and \u201cassisting schools with high concentrations of poverty,\u201d according to the proposal.\nNow, the General Assembly will debate how to fund the Kirwan Commission\u2019s recommendations.\nRepublican Gov. Larry Hogan has frequently chided the commission; in a November statement released following the final meeting, he said, \u201cAfter more than three years of meetings, the Kirwan Tax Hike Commission has still failed to produce any plan to pay for its massive spending proposals.\u201d\nBut Democratic lawmakers are confident that the recommendations will be funded in 2020.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna pass it,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher, D-Montgomery. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s the most important package that we can pass in this upcoming legislative session.\u201d\nMaryland Speaker of the House Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, stands in her office in the State House on Dec. 10, 2019. (Capital News Service photo by Elliott Davis.)\nJones said she is \u201cfirm that we have the funds.\u201d She added that with regard to the discussion around tax increases, the \u201cgovernor is the only one saying that.\u201d\n\u201cWe are the ones that sat on this commission,\u201d the speaker of the House added.\nSen. Jill Carter, D-Baltimore, told Capital News Service that she has \u201cconfidence and hope\u201d that legislators will \u201csecure a veto-proof piece of legislation\u201d to fund the recommendations. Delegate Darryl Barnes, D-Prince George\u2019s, said the debate over Kirwan is \u201ceveryone\u2019s concern right now.\u201d\nSzeliga, the House minority whip, told Capital News Service that Kirwan is a \u201chuge hurdle with the $4 billion price tag.\u201d She said that her party stands \u201cbetween taxpayers\u2019 wallet(s) and the teacher\u2019s union,\u201d which has put its strong support behind the plan.\n\u201cI hope that the leadership in Annapolis can utilize our reasonable, good math skills to protect taxpayers,\u201d Szeliga added.\nDelegate Susan Krebs, R-Carroll, echoed Szeliga\u2019s concerns, saying that while she applauds the work done by the commission, she\u2019s concerned about throwing \u201cmoney at something to say you\u2019ve done something\u201d and repeating \u201cthe mistakes of the past.\u201d\nPJ Hogan, a senior vice president at Cornerstone Government Affairs in Annapolis, told Capital News Service that the debate over funding the Kirwan recommendations is \u201cgoing to suck most of the oxygen out of the room.\u201d Delegate Jared Solomon, D-Montgomery, said he\u2019s heard that legislators are being told not to \u201cput bills in with fiscal notes\u201d due to the focus on education funding. Fiscal notes are prepared by the Department of Legislative Services to explain the economic impact of a given bill.\nBut House Majority Leader Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service that while the Kirwan recommendations will \u201cdominate a lot of the press conversation,\u201d there are many other items on the agenda for 2020.\nOne major item also has to do with education. Democratic General Assembly leaders announced last month a $2.2 billion plan to build and renovate schools across the state that will be taken up during the session. The plan, called the Built to Learn Act, was referred to as \u201cHB1\u201d and \u201cSB1\u201d at the announcement news conference. It will be funded at least in part by bonds from the Maryland Stadium Authority as well as dollars from the state\u2019s casinos, Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore, said at the news conference.\nAnd Hogan announced his own school construction plan this month, called the Building Opportunity Act. The plan would provide $3.8 billion in school construction funding over five years, some of which would \u201ccome from a share of casino revenues in the education lockbox,\u201d according to a news release distributed after Hogan\u2019s announcement.\nWhile education will dominate the session from multiple fronts, both Hogan and state lawmakers have plans to address other issues in the state.\nOn Wednesday, the governor announced a bill aimed at \u201csignificantly\u201d increasing sentences for \u201cviolent offenders who commit crimes with guns,\u201d as well as other \u201cmajor crime\u201d legislation, according to a news release.\nOn the same day, Hogan announced initiatives to address violent crime in Baltimore City, including funding for 25 new prosecutors, $21 million in additional funding for the city and State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d strategy to curb youth violence there, according to the release.\nHogan also pledged in a November release that he will reintroduce political redistricting legislation \u201con the first day of the 2020 legislative session.\u201d\nThe Republican governor has frequently spoken out against gerrymandering in Maryland without much success; the General Assembly is controlled by Democrats in both chambers. Krebs referred to redistricting as a \u201cfiasco\u201d and said she hopes it is addressed in 2020.\n\u201cLet a computer do it if we have to,\u201d she said.\nSome lawmakers told Capital News Service that they will fight Hogan on another one of his priorities: a plan to expand major highways in the state in order to relieve traffic congestion.\nSolomon, the Montgomery County delegate, said he will bring back a bill requiring an environmental study around the effects of Hogan\u2019s plan. Delegate Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, told Capital News Service that there also will be a bill that would require local consent for toll roads. \n\u201cIf the Maryland Department of Transportation is going to agree to the largest (public-private partnership) in the country, I think the General Assembly should have a role to play,\u201d she added.\nLegislators are also hoping that there will be a resolution to a lawsuit between the state and its Historically Black Colleges and Universities over \u201cillegal program duplication\u201d between the institutions and Maryland\u2019s traditionally white universities, according to November release from the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus.\nThe caucus organized a rally in Annapolis last month aimed at urging Hogan to increase his most recent offer of $200 million to be shared among the state\u2019s four HBCUs over 10 years, according to the release. Jones attended the rally and said she wrote in a letter to Hogan that $577 million \u201cis the amount\u201d needed by the universities. In a written statement after the rally, Hogan defended the $200 million offer as a \u201c500 percent increase\u201d over the final offer from the administration of Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. Multiple legislators told Capital News Service they expect funding for HBCUs to be a big talking point during the session.\nLawmakers also expect crime and health issues to be addressed in 2020.\nLuedtke said gun safety bills that passed the House but not the Senate during the last session \u201cwill be coming back.\u201d Senate Majority Whip Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, said she plans to re-introduce her bill that would regulate sales of long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, in the state and has a \u201cgood feeling\u201d about it passing in 2020.\n\u201cCongress hasn\u2019t been able to pass anything,\u201d Lee said. \u201c \u2026 We\u2019ve gotta do something more than thoughts and prayers.\u201d\nWaldstreicher has plans of his own. He said that while Maryland has \u201cvery strict\u201d gun laws, there are also \u201cloopholes that we have to close,\u201d such as background checks and gun storage-related issues. Waldstreicher also plans to introduce a bill that would ban the AM-15 semi-automatic rifle, which he said is legal under Maryland law. Police say the weapon was used in the Dayton, Ohio, mass shooting in August, according to NBC News.\nThere are also plans to address the increasing health issues associated with e-cigarettes. Comptroller Peter Franchot, a Democrat, formed a task force to examine the \u201cpublic health and safety implications\u201d of these devices, and the group had its first meeting in December, according to a news release. The goal of the task force is to produce a report and submit related legislation to the General Assembly during the 2020 session, according to the release.\nLam, a physician, announced last month that he will file a bill banning certain flavored vapes, such as bubble gum and mint. He told Capital News Service that he expects pushback from the vaping industry, and said he feels that the devices are \u201cobviously\u201d targeting young people to \u201cget them hooked\u201d with these flavors.\nBut Lam also sees a \u201cgeneral concern over the state\u2019s budget\u201d to be a \u201cbig driver of things\u201d during the session, with major additional funding toward education being considered amid the possibility that the economy will \u201cnot be doing as well\u201d in the near future.\nIt\u2019s a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d Lam said.",

    "summary": "Student loan debt in the U.S. has reached $1.48 trillion, with federal loans making up 81% of this total and carrying lower interest rates compared to private loans.",
    "content": "Student loan debt has reached an all-time high of $1.48 trillion as of June 2019, and is expected to increase, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nRoughly 81% of this debt is composed of federal direct loans, as reported by Federal Student Aid (FSA), an office of the U.S. Department of Education.\nThere are two main components of student loan debt \u2014 federal loans and private loans. Federal loans are lent by the government; whereas, private loans are lent by banks and other private financial institutions. Private loans can have high, variable interest rates.\nFederal loans tend to have low, fixed interest rates. The current interest rate for both direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 4.53%.\n\u201cThe latest student loan debt statistics for 2019 show how serious the student loan debt crisis has become for borrowers across all demographics and age groups,\u201d Zack Friedman, entrepreneur and bestselling author of The Lemonade Life, wrote in an article published by Forbes.\nFriedman also stated that student loan debt is now \u201cthe second highest consumer debt category\u201d in the U.S.\nSome students, however, feel that there is a general lack of knowledge about the impact that student loans can have on post-graduation life.\n\u201cThankfully, I had the guidance of my mother, who calculated what my loans would be for each of the schools I [was] accepted to. She made the facts about student loans incredibly clear \u2013 facts I previously turned a blind eye to, thinking that finances and scholarships would just work out,\u201d Nichola Merkel, a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), said. \u201cWithout her, I probably would have ended up at an out-of-state school, ignorant to the debt that awaited my upon graduation.\u201d\nMerkel, along with other students at UMD, agreed that without the guidance from parents or older siblings they, too, would turn a \u201cblind eye\u201d to the debt acquired from taking out a loan.\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to have an older brother who went through the entire student loan process so my family was able to assist me with what sorts of loans would have the lowest interest and would be easiest to take out and pay off,\u201d Kathryn Ozeroff, a junior at UMD, said.\nWith or without family guidance, the balance of federal student loan debt is still high in comparison to previous years.\nThe balance of all federal loans in the U.S. and Puerto Rico is $1.36 trillion as of June 2019, reported in the Federal Student Loan Portfolio published by FSA. California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Tennessee are the top 15 states with the highest federal loan balance. These states alone comprise 66% of the total balance.\n\nColleges within each state offer different federal loan packages for their students.\nIn Maryland, Johns Hopkins University has the highest reported tuition and fees but has the lowest average federal loan amount per undergraduate student from 2017 to 2018 at $5,035. Washington College is next with an average amount of $6,206, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do any research prior to applying for a loan. I had a lot of support from my parents and they helped me through the process,\u201d Molly Briguglio, a senior at UMD, said. \u201cEven now, I am still very unaware of what the entire federal loan process entails. When applying to these loans, I went in with a very indifferent attitude because it is so common these days to have loans, and nearly every college student I talk to has some form of a federal loan.\u201d\nNCES reported that UMD gave an average amount of $6,395 to each of its undergraduate students from 2017 to 2018.\n\nStrayer University has one of the lowest tuition rates in Maryland but has the highest average federal loan amount at $11,238.\nBriguglio and Ozeroff, along with about 787,700 borrowers in Maryland, have at least some form of federal student loan debt.\n\u201cI try to look on the bright side of things and figure, if I\u2019m having to take out these loans to learn, I should then be more motivated and successful and ideally have a job that enables me to pay off my loans quickly,\u201d Ozeroff said. \u201cWhen I think about it that way, it acts as more of a motivator than weight.\u201d\nAlmost half of those borrowers have at most $20,000 in debt and about 21% have anywhere from $20,000 to $40,000 in federal student loans.\n\nAbout 10% of borrowers have at least $100,000 in debt.\nDespite having debt, students from UMD say that they hope to get a well-paying entry level position to be able to start making monthly loan payments.\n\u201cI am constantly thinking about getting a job in order to start saving up money for when I graduate,\u201d Briguglio said.",

    "summary": "Maryland lawmakers have announced a $2.2 billion plan, called the Built to Learn Act, aimed at constructing and renovating schools across the state, with annual payments of about $125 million funded by bonds and casino revenues. The initiative, set for discussion in the 2020 legislative session, aims to prioritize education and return Maryland to its former top ranking in school quality.",
    "content": "FOREST HEIGHTS, Maryland \u2014 Sen. Bill Ferguson, likely Maryland\u2019s next Senate president, stood in Forest Heights Elementary \u2014 a school shut down temporarily for safety reasons \u2014 on Wednesday, and said the building \u201ctells its own story\u201d when it comes to education in the state.\n\u201cWe can, we must and we will do better,\u201d Ferguson, D-Baltimore, said during a news conference.\nFerguson, along with other Democratic leaders from both the Maryland Senate and House of Delegates, and other officials, announced Wednesday a $2.2 billion plan to build and renovate schools across the state that will be taken up during the 2020 legislative session.\nThe plan, called the Built to Learn Act, will be funded at least in part by bonds from the Maryland Stadium Authority as well as dollars from the state\u2019s casinos, said Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore. McIntosh said the $2.2 billion total will be broken up into approximately $125 million annual payments.\n\u201cThis bill has nothing to do with taxes,\u201d McIntosh told reporters after the announcement.\nJake Weissmann, chief of staff to outgoing Senate President Thomas V. \u201cMike\u201d Miller Jr., told Capital News Service that determining the split between building new schools and renovating current ones will \u201cdepend on the jurisdiction\u201d and its needs.\nMiller, the first to speak at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, said the plan is about getting Maryland \u201cback to No. 1\u201d in education.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make school construction and school operating funds our No. 1 priority,\u201d Miller said. \u201c \u2026 It\u2019s going to be astounding.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s announcement further means that education will dominate the 2020 session, with the legislature also taking up recommendations from a commission created for the purposes of studying how to transform Maryland\u2019s public education system.\nThe current proposal by the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, chaired by former University of Maryland President William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, recommends phasing in increased funding over the next 10 fiscal years. In fiscal year 2030, direct state aid would exceed $10.2 billion, which is $2.8 billion \u201cmore than would be allocated under current law,\u201d according to the commission\u2019s proposal.\nSen. Bill Ferguson, D-Baltimore, speaks at a news conference at Forest Heights Elementary School on Nov. 6, 2019 announcing a $2.2 billion school construction and renovation plan for the state. Capital News Service photo by Elliott Davis.\n\u201cWe will move forward with both because we cannot afford not to,\u201d Ferguson said Wednesday, referring to the commission\u2019s recommendations and the school construction plan.\nThe General Assembly attempted to pass a bill during the 2019 session \u2014 similar to the one announced Wednesday \u2014 that would have created a public-private partnership in Prince George\u2019s County allocating over $2 billion in funds for public school construction. The bill, known as the Build to Learn Act of 2019, died in the Senate.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan referenced the bill in an October statement that criticized the Kirwan commission.\n\u201cNo governor has ever invested more in our schools,\u201d Hogan said in the statement, while also referring to the commission as the \u201cTax Hike Commission\u201d that it is \u201chellbent on spending billions more than we can afford.\u201d\nMiller, D-Calvert, Charles and Prince George\u2019s, said Wednesday that Hogan wants to \u201cbuild schools, but nothing inside the schools.\u201d\nHogan previously proposed a $2 billion school construction investment, which he called in the October statement \u201cthe largest in Maryland history.\u201d\n\u201cWhile they are a year late, we are glad that General Assembly leaders are now endorsing our historic school construction plan,\u201d Hogan said in a statement following Wednesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cClearly, they recognize that we need to provide school systems \u2014 and most importantly, our students \u2014 with the healthy, efficient, and modern school buildings they deserve. Now that our legislators are finally making school construction a priority, I certainly look forward to working with them to get it done.\u201d\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, said that improvements to school buildings are \u201clong overdue.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that student literacy is on a rapid decline,\u201d Jones said. A recent national report found reading scores among Maryland fourth and eighth graders in decline. \u201c \u2026 Students can\u2019t learn if their classrooms are deteriorating.\u201d\n\u201cThe 2020 legislative session will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make sure that every student in every neighborhood has a great public school,\u201d said Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, in a statement. \u201c\u2026as well as expanded career technical education, increased educator pay, and more educators in our schools to increase individual attention for students.\u201d\nSen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s, told Capital News Service prior to the news conference that the announcement is part of a \u201cmajor push in both chambers\u201d toward school construction. Pinsky is the chair of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee.\nPinsky added that lawmakers want school construction to be \u201cHB1 and SB1\u201d \u2014 in other words, the first bills of the 2020 legislative session. A sign at the news conference, referring to the Built to Learn Act as \u201cHouse Bill 1\u201d and \u201cSenate Bill 1,\u201d reflected Pinsky\u2019s words.",

This semester, the organization has rescued over 7,000 pounds of food and is reviving efforts to recover food from sports events.",
    "content": "Although the average college campus generates about 169,000 pounds of uneaten food every year, the College Park chapter of the Food Recovery Network has recovered over 274,000 pounds of food waste to date, and this number is still growing.\u00a0\nThe Food Recovery Network (FRN), a nonprofit food waste recovery organization founded by four University of Maryland students in 2011, donates uneaten food from college dining halls to groups such as Christian Life Center in Riverdale Park and, in the past, other organizations such as Family Crisis Center in Brentwood. There are now eight FRN chapters in Maryland and\u00a0 230 chapters across the nation, accounting for over 3 million pounds of food recovered.\n\u201cThe Food Recovery Network started off at the 251 North diner, so we recover from 251 every single week night, while we recover from North Campus Diner only a couple times a week,\u201d said Nishu Hosamane, vice president of FRN. In the past, the organization has also saved food from South Campus Dining Hall and the Adele H. Stamp Catering Kitchen.\nAccording to Hosamane, FRN goes to 251 North and packages uneaten food in pans, sometimes with the help of dining hall staff if not enough volunteers are present.\u00a0\nThis semester, the organization is reviving \u201csports recoveries,\u201d essentially going to stadiums like the Xfinity Center and the Maryland Stadium after basketball and football games to recover uneaten food.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s super important because it provides food for [our partners] during the weekends because we\u2019re only at diners on the weekdays,\u201d she said.\nThis semester, the organization has rescued over 7,000 pounds of food so far. This includes protein, dairy, grains, produce and desserts.\n\n\u201cWe follow pretty strict guidelines when it comes to splitting up vegetarian food and meat so it\u2019s not cross-contaminated for people who are vegetarian,\u201d said Hosamane. \u201cThen we package up the food and we take it to the Christian Life Center.\u201d\nFrom there, Christian Life Center redistributes it to nine other partner organizations, including Meals on Wheels, Bread for the City, the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Day Center for Homeless, among others.\n\n\u201cIdeally we\u2019d like to [recover food] every single night at every single diner but funding is our main issue and that\u2019s why we aren\u2019t able to do that right now,\u201d said Hosamane. \u201cWe have enough volunteers for it because we have a lot of interest in volunteering.\u201d\nCompared to other universities, the College Park chapter is in the lead. The Towson University chapter has recovered over 12,000 pounds of food waste and Goucher College is close behind, with 7,000 pounds recovered.\n\nForty percent of food in the United States goes uneaten. This has a few implications.\nAccording to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), this uneaten food contributes to a loss of $160 billion per year. College campuses nationwide produce 22 million pounds of food waste annually, but some are making changes to divert food waste altogether. Trayless dining, which contributes to a 25 to 30 percent drop in food waste according to an Aramark study, as well as food recovery programs like FRN, are more common.\nHosamane is unsure if the amount of food waste at the University of Maryland has changed since she began volunteering for FRN three years ago. \u201cThe amount of food we\u2019ve gotten hasn\u2019t changed, but that\u2019s based off of the diners, not the students themselves and if they\u2019re consciously making an effort not to waste food.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland officials and lawmakers are questioning U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos about the high denial rate of applications for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which was established to forgive student loan debt for those who work in public service for 10 years.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and a coalition of state lawmakers have asked U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos why so many people are being denied by the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\nThe program, which was established by Congress in 2007, allows borrowers to have their student loan debt forgiven if they have worked for a qualifying public service organization for at least 10 years with 120 payments, according to the Federal Student Aid website.\nQualifying employers include federal, state or local government organizations, 501(c)(3) organizations and nonprofit organizations that provide a qualifying public service but are not tax-exempt, according to the Education Department.\nBorrowers first became eligible for forgiveness in September 2017, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. But even though 19,321 people had applied by April of last year, only 55 had been granted loan forgiveness, the office reported.\nCongress funded the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program last year to help borrowers who had issues being accepted due to being in a non-qualifying payment plan, according to the government\u2019s office of Federal Student Aid. A new Government Accountability Office report this month found, however, that 99% of the 54,184 applications under the expanded program had been denied.\nNow, Maryland officials and lawmakers are asking DeVos for answers.\nFrosh joined a coalition of attorneys general in sending a letter to DeVos in late August urging the Education Department to provide data to help states address issues with the program, according to a news release. A similar coalition asked the department for data last year, but the response provided \u201cincomplete\u201d information.\n\u201cThousands of Marylanders have committed to 10 years of service to their communities, because they relied upon the promise of (Public Service Loan Forgiveness),\u201d Frosh said in a statement. \u201cInstead of honoring that promise, Secretary DeVos has met them with confusing guidelines, lack of information and, ultimately, denial of loan forgiveness.\u201d\nRaquel Coombs, a spokeswoman for Frosh, told Capital News Service that the number of people approved for the loan forgiveness program is a \u201cwoefully small number.\u201d The data provided to the attorneys general by the Education Department indicated that 864 of 76,002 people nationwide who applied to the program since it began were accepted, according to the release.\nDelegate Lesley Lopez, D-Montgomery, led a coalition of 43 Maryland state senators and delegates in sending a letter to DeVos also asking for information about the implementation of the loan forgiveness program. The lawmakers discuss in the letter the \u201cgrowing body of evidence documenting that the Department has mishandled this program.\u201d\n\u201cThousands of Marylanders will likely not be able to receive the debt relief they were promised and will face financial hardship if this mishandling continues,\u201d the letter adds.\nLopez told Capital News Service that student loan debt is something she has been thinking about for a \u201clong time.\u201d She said that after hearing a National Institutes of Health employee speak about being denied by the loan forgiveness program, she decided to \u201cdig into it.\u201d It eventually became \u201creally clear\u201d that the program \u201cwasn\u2019t being managed in the way it was originally designed,\u201d Lopez said.\n\u201cEligibility was intended to be pretty expansive,\u201d Lopez said.\nNow, it is \u201cnebulous \u2026 it means nothing,\u201d she added.\nThe Montgomery County delegate said the current conversation is \u201cjust the starting point of a whole portfolio of bills\u201d that will address student loan debt in the next General Assembly session.\nAngela Morabito, the press secretary for the U.S. Education Department, said in a written statement that the department \u201chas been faithfully administering the complex program designed by Congress.\u201d\n\u201cComplexities in the (Public Service Loan Forgiveness) program include restrictions on the types of eligible loans and no authority to require borrowers to annually report their participation in the program,\u201d Morabito added. \u201cThe framework designed by Congress is confusing for borrowers, and we are working to make it as straightforward as the rules allow.\u201d\nSunshine Brosi, an associate professor in the biology department at Frostburg State University, said she found out about the program when it launched in 2007. She said she was told she was \u201con track\u201d for forgiveness. She ended up being denied.\nHandout photo of Sunshine Brosi. Courtesy Sunshine Brosi.\nBrosi said she was denied because she was in the wrong repayment plan. Later, the reasoning given to her was that she was working with the wrong kind of service provider. She said she thinks of these reasons as \u201clittle excuses,\u201d and feels that she has been \u201cmisled\u201d on the qualifications of the program.\n\u201cHow can 99% of people have done something wrong?\u201d Brosi asked.\nBrosi said she turned down a job with a higher salary so she could stay in a qualifying position for the forgiveness program, and even chose her profession originally because of it.\nShe added, \u201cI definitely assumed that my loans would be paid off by this point \u2026 People make decisions thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to have this thing paid off.\u2019 \u201d\nShahryar Rizvi, a Burtonsville, Maryland, resident and federal employee of 15 years, told Capital News Service that while he has not been denied for loan forgiveness, he has had his own frustrations with what he described as a \u201chorribly administered program.\u201d He would not disclose his employer.\nRizvi, 38, said the problem \u201cfirst and foremost would be the communication\u201d from the Education Department regarding the qualifications needed to be accepted. He has spoken about the issues with the program at town halls because he has been \u201cburned by it so bad.\u201d The application process, he said, is a \u201cformality and unnecessary hoop.\u201d\nAfter originally being in the wrong repayment plan, Rizvi said he is now on track for forgiveness and is three years into qualifying payments. Because of the strict requirements, Rizvi said, he has to stay in his current federal job in order to get his debt forgiven.\nRisvi added that while he does not necessarily want to leave his job, he wants \u201cthe freedom to search and leave.\u201d He said he does not have that freedom.",

One bill, sponsored by Delegate Pam Queen, proposes teaching students about organ donation starting at age 14, while another, by Sen.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Several bills progressing in the Maryland General Assembly would provide support for living organ or tissue donors, and educate high school students about becoming a donor.\nSponsored by Sen. Shirley Nathan-Pulliam, D-Baltimore City and County, Senate bill 954 could require county boards of education to begin teaching students about organ donation in public schools starting in the 2020-2021 school year.\nThat bill, and an identical piece of legislation sponsored by Delegate Pam Queen, D-Montgomery, are intended to begin teaching students about organ donation at the age of 14, before they receive their driver\u2019s licenses and decide whether they want to be a donor, Queen said.\nThis bill is intended to get more young people registered as organ donors to combat the long waiting list for organ donation, Queen said. The bill is also aimed to promote awareness of live organ donation, she said.\nAs of February 2018, there were 3,375 people in Maryland waiting on organ donations according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Almost 2,500 of these people are waiting for a kidney\u2014an organ that can be donated from a living individual\u2014transplanted, according to department data.\nIn May 2017, Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel, received a living donor liver transplant from his sister, Kathleen Bernhardt, according to a 2018 report from the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nQueen\u2019s bill, House bill 567, was heard by a Maryland House of Delegates committee February 21. Nathan-Pulliam\u2019s bill is expected to be heard by a Maryland Senate committee Wednesday.\nOther Maryland legislation, sponsored by Sen. Brian Feldman, D-Montgomery, would ensure 60 days of unpaid leave for a recovering organ donor and 30 days for a bone marrow donor if the donor\u2019s employer has at least 15 employees.\nJohns Hopkins University\u2019s Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation Director of Data and Analytics Allan Massie told a House committee about his experience as a bone marrow donor.\n\u201cIn 2013, I won a strange kind of lottery,\u201d Massie said. \u201cI was found to be a genetic match for a young child in Utah who I had never met, who had a terminal disease I had never heard of and who hadn\u2019t even been born when I joined the marrow registry,\u201d he said.\nBecause he works for a transplant group, Massie said he didn\u2019t have to worry about taking time off after the donation. He said that because not everyone has this luxury, this bill would be necessary to ensure that people can make donations without risking their job.\nAmerican Kidney Fund employee Shayla Harris said this bill would continue to encourage people to become living donors like her sister, who donated Harris a life-saving kidney while she was in college in 2010.\n\u201cOrgan donation saved my life and I believe living organ donors are real-life superheroes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere are thousands of people in our state that need a transplant and whose health and life could be improved by the generosity of a living donor,\u201d she said.\nEight other states offer some form of leave for either bone marrow or organ donation, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\nSenate bill 705 and a corresponding bill in the Maryland House of Delegates would also prevent insurance companies from prohibiting organ donation or altering an insurance plan based on one\u2019s status as a donor, according to the House bill\u2019s sponsor, Delegate Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery.\nAbout a quarter of kidney donors in Maryland have difficulty finding life insurance according to Massie.\nA Maryland Senate committee voted favorably with amendments Monday on Senate bill 705. Luedtke\u2019s counterpart, House bill 1284, was heard by a Maryland House of Delegates committee Feb. 28.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Students in Maryland public schools who fail required vision screenings and do not receive recommended services would be provided free eye examinations and eyeglasses by a new Maryland Department of Health program, under legislation expected to be heard by a Senate committee on Wednesday.\nSenate bill 915 and House bill 1242 would create the Vision for Maryland Program, which would coordinate with Johns Hopkins University, local boards of education and local health departments to carry out the eye exams for students and give glasses to them if necessary.\nThe Ways and Means committee had a hearing for the House bill on March 7, but it has yet to receive a committee vote.\nLocal boards of education or local health departments are mandated to screen vision and hearing for all public school students when they enter the school system, in first grade and in eighth or ninth grade under current law. This would remain largely unchanged under the legislation.\nStudents who have behavioral or learning problems would be given eye exams \u2014 regardless of their grade \u2014 when documentation of the problem begins, or when the school is notified of a medical change, according to a legislative analysis of the bill.\nParents and guardians of students are required to receive results of the screenings, and if a student fails, would be given additional information on how to follow up with an eye exam, under a 2017 state law.\nThe bill ensures students in the state who otherwise could not see the blackboard have access to success, lead sponsor Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, told Capital News Service last week.\n\u201cWhere learning is concerned \u2026 the ability to read and see is critical,\u201d Delegate Terri Hill, D-Howard and Baltimore counties, also a lead sponsor, told legislators at a committee hearing on March 7.\nBefore passage of the 2017 legislation, 50 percent of students who failed the screening never got an eye exam, and a significant portion never got the glasses, Hill told legislators.\n\u201cEarly diagnosis and treatment of children\u2019s vision problems is a necessary component to school readiness and academic learning,\u201d Latisha Corey, president of the Maryland Parent Teacher Association, said in written testimony to a House committee. \u201cVision screening is not a substitute for a complete eye and vision evaluation by an eye doctor.\u201d\nHowever, the government organization tasked with operating the program opposed the bill, because it would place a \u201csubstantial fiscal burden\u201d on the Maryland Department of Health, and would put \u201clogistical burdens\u201d on school systems, according to written testimony from Robert Neall, secretary of the Maryland Department of Health.\n\u201cDuring the 2017-2018 school year, 38,638 students received a referral after vision screening,\u201d Neall wrote. \u201cThe cost for the provision of an eye examination and glasses for these students could be approximately $5,449,688 annually.\u201d\nAn estimated 9,349 students in special education programs and 5,000 students in different learning environments were reported by Anne Arundel County Public Schools, the Maryland Association of County Health Officers said in a written statement on March 7. \u201cExtrapolating this to the population of the state, the annual cost to the local Board and Health Departments is estimated at over $20,000,000.\u201d\nBut according to a legislative analysis, the bill would cost the Maryland Department of Health an estimated $231,889 to hire employees to coordinate the program.\nThe same analysis said it would cost local boards of education and local health departments an estimated $900,000 a year to provide eye exams to students who begin a special education program or notify their schools of a change in medical history. This estimate did not include local costs for students who need behavior or learning intervention, who would also be covered under the bill.\nSome local boards of education and local health departments opposed the measure, saying it is overreaching and questioning the practicality of its mandates.\nThe \u201cunfunded mandate,\u201d would require \u201cthe hiring of ophthalmologists and a mobile van to travel between schools to provide services required by the bill,\u201d the Montgomery Department of Health and Human Services said in a written statement on March 7.\n\u201cWhile this legislation is well-intentioned, (Anne Arundel County Public Schools) has concerns with the requirement that county boards of education coordinate with the Vision for Maryland Program,\u201d Anne Arundel County schools attorney Jeanette Ortiz said in a written statement on March 7. \u201cSuch a responsibility does not fall on a county board of education.\u201d",

This year, the legislation is co-sponsored by multiple Republicans and Democrats.\n\u201cFamiliarity with computer languages is one of the few skills that can lead directly to high-paying jobs without the need for a 4-year degree,\u201d Jeffrey Jerome, chairman of a science and technology advisory panel for Baltimore County Schools, said in a written statement about last year\u2019s bill.\n\u201cThis proposal provides accommodation for students of different abilities,\u201d who are \u201cunable to process traditional foreign languages,\u201d Jerome said.\nMembers of the autism community are supportive of the bill, because those affected by autism often struggle with language, but excel with computers, Rose said.\nHowever, opponents say not learning a foreign language would be detrimental to students\u2019 understanding of world culture and chances of getting into college.\nWhile computer programming is important, \u201cMaryland students need to be prepared to participate in the world community both inside and outside our borders,\u201d Public School Superintendents\u2019 Association of Maryland Executive Director Renee Spence said in a written statement for last year\u2019s bill.\nThe role of \u201cCurriculum, courses of study or graduation requirements \u2026 belongs to local boards of education working together with the State Board of Education,\u201d not legislators, Spence said.\n\u201cWhile this bill does not increase existing requirements for high school students to obtain a diploma, it would severely limit college entrance competitiveness,\u201d Latisha Corey, president of the Maryland PTA said in written testimony for last year\u2019s bill.\nStudents who decide to use the option of learning a programming language for foreign language credit may be denied entry into Maryland\u2019s flagship university and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, an analysis of the bill said.\nRose said altering foreign language acceptance requirements is something both universities should think about changing, and stressed the bill would not require students to take a programming course, rather it would just create another option.",

The bill will also heighten the rigor of state certification standards for teachers, Kirwan said.\nThis bill would provide early support and intervention for low-income families, including full-day prekindergarten for children ages 3 and 4, according to Kirwan.\nThe blueprint will set a \u201ccollege and career readiness standard,\u201d one that is aimed to ensure that by the time a student completes the 10th grade (if not, by the time of high school graduation), they will have the English and mathematical literacy necessary to succeed in the first year of a community college program, according to Kirwan.\nThe \u201cblueprint\u201d will also provide pathways to free early college programs that would allow students who have met these standards to earn an associate\u2019s degree while still in high school. \u00a0The bill will also provide access to career and technical education for those who have met the college and career readiness standards.\nThe measure would provide additional support and services for English learners, students with disabilities and students from low-income families who have not met their college and career readiness standards.\nThe bill would also provide an accountability system to ensure that school districts are implementing the improvements identified by the commission, according to Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, R, underlined the importance of making sure the bill\u2019s accountability system is air-tight in a letter he sent to legislative leaders Nov. 27.\n\u201cIncreased funding and strong accountability are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they must be aligned to ensure that Marylanders are receiving a world class education and good value for the state tax dollars invested,\u201d Hogan said in the letter. \nStudents and educators, clad in red Strong Schools Maryland T-shirts, came to Annapolis to show their support. \nEleven-year-old City Neighbors Charter School student Mallory Lerch said increased funding and access to teachers would make for a better, more creative classroom environment at her school in Baltimore.\n\u201cI think our schools are really underfunded and we deserve more,\u201d Mallory said. \nThe Maryland State Education Association said they are in support of the bill and the school improvements and teacher salary increases it addresses, according to the president, Cheryl Bost.\nThough no hearing date has been set, identical legislation, Senate bill 1030, is scheduled to be heard by a Maryland Senate committee Wednesday.",

The Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education seeks $3.8 billion over ten years for these improvements, with legislative action anticipated next year.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Maryland\u2019s congressional delegation has voiced strong support for a sweeping plan to reform the state\u2019s educational system.\nThe Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education has been investigating how to improve Maryland\u2019s public schools for more than two years.\nIn a meeting in the House Tuesday with some of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, commission chairman William E. \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, former president of the University of Maryland, College Park and former chancellor of the University System of Maryland, said the state\u2019s educational system is \u201cmediocre\u201d and more needs to be done to strengthen it.\n\u201cWe are at a huge crossroads moment for our state,\u201d Kirwan said. \u201cOne of the hurdles we have to overcome is the complacency about the quality of our education.\u201d\nOne problem the commission has identified is insufficient financial support for schools located in low-income areas.\n\u201cWe just aren\u2019t investing enough money as other states and other countries do in these schools,\u201d Kirwan said.\nThe commission is recommending expanding access to high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds and career and technical education for high schoolers.\nAnother top concern of the commission is the high turnover rate for teachers in the state. According to Kirwan, 47 percent of second-year teachers do not return for a third year.\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said \u201celevating the profession of teaching as a high profession with adequate training and compensation\u201d is imperative to improving the quality of education in the state.\nThe commission is currently requesting $3.8 billion for the necessary improvements. Cardin said this money would be phased in over a ten-year period in a \u201cfiscally responsible manner.\u201d\nKirwan said he expects the Maryland General Assembly to address several of the commission\u2019s findings in the coming weeks. No significant legislation, though, is expected until next year\u2019s legislative session as the commission continues to work through the fall of 2019.\nKirwan said the leaders of the Maryland General Assembly are committed to considering legislation that implements the recommendations of the commission.\nThe delegation members made it clear that they consider education reform one of their highest priorities at the state and federal level.\n\u201cI think implementing the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission (has) to be the top, number one priority of the state,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said.\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, said \u201cthe greatest threat to our national security is our failure to properly educate every single one of our children.\u201d\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said in a statement that \u201cwe must ensure that every student has the opportunity to succeed, from early childhood education through secondary education.\u201d\n\u201cIt is critically important that we bolster school readiness and college and career readiness as well as address disparities for students of color and students in low-income communities,\u201d Hoyer added. \u201cThe delegation is committed to supporting the implementation of Dr. Kirwan\u2019s recommendations and working with local leaders and stakeholders to improve public education in our state.\u201d",

The legislation follows criticism of the board's handling of an investigation into the death of a University of Maryland football player.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 The University System of Maryland Board of Regents structure would be altered and its decision-making would be made more public under legislation the state Senate and House of Delegates are considering.\nThe two identical bills would make several changes to the composition of the board. It would add four members; the Senate President and speaker of the House would appoint one each, the state secretary of commerce would join as an ex-officio member, and a second student member would be added. One student member would be allotted one vote for one year.\nThe board\u2019s meetings would be live-streamed and an archive would be made available to the public.\nDelegate Ben Barnes, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, sponsored the House bill and Sen. Sarah Elfreth, D-Anne Arundel, sponsored the Senate bill.\nElfreth, who served on the Board of Regents as a student member, called the bill a \u201chealthy review of a state organization.\u201d\nThere are 17 members of the board. Sixteen are appointed by the governor to five-year terms and the student member serves a one-year term.\nThe measures are reasonable steps to add diversity to the board and keep the fundamental structure of the panel in place, Barnes said.\nThe bill would also open up the board\u2019s decision making to the public, forcing it to make public all votes from open and closed meetings, as well as votes from any sessions relating to the employment or termination of university presidents.\nThe introduction of these bills comes months after the board received criticism for its handling of an investigation into the University of Maryland football program following the death of 19-year-old offensive lineman Jordan McNair.\nMcNair died in June after suffering heatstroke at an offseason workout. His death sparked two investigations \u2014 both of which the board oversaw \u2014 into the football team\u2019s medical staff and its culture under head coach DJ Durkin.\nAfter a months-long investigation, the board recommended in October that the university retain Durkin, despite reports that University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh wanted to dismiss the coach.\nThe board met in a closed session the week before announcing its decision.\nAt the news conference, Loh announced he would retire in June 2019. And after widespread backlash from fans, alumni, and even Gov. Larry Hogan, R, he fired Durkin one day later.\nThe board announced in January that Loh will continue to serve as president through June 2020, and a search committee would be assembled to select his successor.\nRegents Chair James T. Brady also resigned following the saga, saying, \u201cmy continued presence on the board will inhibit its ability to move Maryland\u2019s higher education agenda forward.\u201d\nSen. Jim Rosapepe, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, co-sponsor of the Senate bill and a former regent, said he has kept in contact with the board since the fallout.\nHe acknowledged the board made a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d but said it recognized its misstep and took action to fix it. Rosapepe said he was unsure whether there would be any pushback to the legislation at next week\u2019s hearings, but called the changes \u201cmodest.\u201d\nA House committee is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss House bill 533, while a Senate committee would meet on Wednesday for Senate bill 719.\nThis isn\u2019t the sole piece of legislation to be proposed as a result of the debacle at College Park. The House of Delegates introduced a bill, sponsored by Brooke Lierman, D-Baltimore, which would allow student-athletes to unionize. A hearing for that bill is scheduled for March 1.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Maryland lawmakers are proposing a bill to simplify the process of applying for federal aid for students who have no contact with their parents. \nReps. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, and John Sarbanes, D-Towson, introduced the FAFSA Fairness Act of 2019 in the House, while Maryland Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin will introduce companion legislation in the Senate. \n\u201cWe believe this is an important piece in making college more affordable for more students,\u201d Van Hollen told Capital News Service in an interview. \u201cThis is a small but important measure to help students who, for all practical purposes, do not have parents who can help them participate in paying for college.\u201d \nThe bill would apply to students who do not have contact with their parents because they escaped abusive homes, were abandoned or have incarcerated parents.\n\u201cStudents that have faced difficult and abusive life circumstances that leave them unable to contact their parents should have the same chance as their peers to apply for federal student aid and make informed financial decisions,\u201d Cardin said in a statement.. \nThe current FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) does not allow for students to apply under independent status. \nStudents with special circumstances must contact each college or university to which they applied and request a \u201ddependency override\u201d before their aid package is calculated. This process can be arduous and dissuade students from completing their applications, Van Hollen said. \nThe bill includes a key provision that would allow students to apply under a \u201cprovisionally independent\u201d category. They would instantly receive a conditional calculation of their financial aid award and complete the dependency override only with the school at which they are enrolling. \n\u201cThis bill will help prevent our financial aid process from continuing to be an unintended barrier to higher education,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \nVan Hollen said simplifying the FAFSA application process became important to Maryland lawmakers because of concerns voiced by their constituents.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing about the need to do this\u2026from students across the state,\u201d he said.\nCummings, Cardin and Van Hollen first introduced the bill last year as the FAFSA Fairness Act of 2018, but it did not pass the Republican-controlled House. Democrats took control of the House in January. \nThis time, Van Hollen said he expects the bill to garner bipartisan support. \nThe FAFSA bill is expected to be part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which Van Hollen says the House will take up this year. \n\u201cThe most likely route to success would be to include this provision as part of that larger bill,\u201d Van Hollen said. \nSeveral educational organizations have announced support of the bill, including the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators and the American Council on Education.",

Hogan plans to introduce a competing bill requiring local school systems to put the decision to start before Labor Day on the ballot for voter approval.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 After several days of debate, a Senate bill to effectively rescind Republican Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s executive order starting Maryland public schools after Labor Day passed 31-13 on Tuesday, with Democrats voting yes and Republicans voting no.\nThe governor said last week he planned to introduce a competing bill that says that any local school system that aims to start school before Labor Day will be required to put that decision on the ballot, giving \u201cgenuine local control\u201d over the issue.\nHogan said his plan to introduce legislation came after special interest groups painted his initiative as a \u201ccrazy idea of the governor\u201d to force schools to change, all while he was following recommendations set forth under a Democratic administration.\nThe executive order mandated the school year start after Labor Day, last 180 days and end by June 15, with five days additional discretionary days for emergencies or weather-related closures.\nTaking effect in the 2017-2018 school year, the move had support from over 70 percent of Maryland residents, Hogan said Thursday morning in a press conference.\nLocal school systems could set their own academic calendars, provided they follow Hogan\u2019s start and end dates and length of school year set in the order.\nThe move to start schools after Labor Day started in 2013 under former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, D, when a task force to study a post-Labor Day start date was established.\nSince then, five bills supporting school after Labor Day have been introduced, with bipartisan support from nearly 60 sponsors. Of those, 29 still serve in the General Assembly, according to a press release from the governor\u2019s office.\nHogan pointed to the task force recommendation, as well as independent polls from Goucher College taken in 2014 and 2015 indicating about 70 percent of Marylanders supported the later school-start initiative.\nPrior to Hogan\u2019s order, school districts had the choice to start school when they wanted, according to Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George\u2019s. \u00a0\nHowever, when they had the choice, out of the 24 jurisdictions, 23 chose to start before Labor Day, said Pinsky, a lead sponsor of Senate Bill 128, which fights back against Hogan\u2019s order in this year\u2019s legislative session.\nHis bill requires that each local board of education set the start and end dates for the school year for public schools, along with repealing the provision that authorizes a five-day extension after June 15 without approval from the State Board of Education.\n\u201cWe are not telling people when to start school, we want to put it back in their hands,\u201d Pinsky said on his bill\u2019s goals during a debate on the state Senate floor later Thursday morning.\nHowever, Hogan argues that the Democrats\u2019 legislation \u201cmasquerades under the guise of more local control, which would do the opposite of what local citizens want and instead empower a handful of unaccountable bureaucrats and administrators,\u201d he said in the press conference last week.\n\nVideo by Julia Kim & Joe Ilardi\nPinsky also argued that Hogan\u2019s order constrains religious holidays, spring breaks, staff trainings and eliminates counties\u2019 flexibility to address local concerns such as severe weather.\nMaking decisions on school calendars is tough work, and the best decisions for scheduling can be made by the teachers, parents, students and support staff, said Steven Hershkowitz, press secretary for the Maryland State Education Association, which supports Pinsky\u2019s bill.\nIf approved in the House, the bill will take effect on July 1. \nHogan can veto the bill but the Democrats in the legislature hold a veto-proof three-fifths majority and can override it.\nHogan can also organize constituents to overturn the Democrats\u2019 legislation through a popular referendum, which requires a petition with signatures and support from 3 percent of registered voters in the state, calculated based on the number of votes cast for governor in the most recent election. \u00a0\u00a0\nHogan last week said there\u2019s a 100 percent chance that voters will gather the signatures they need to put a referendum on the ballot, with a majority of the voters in favor of mandating a later start.\nHogan released a statement on his Facebook page Tuesday, criticizing senators who voted to repeal his executive order after previously endorsing post-Labor Day school starts.\n\u201cIf that isn\u2019t blatant, partisan hypocrisy, then I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he wrote in a post on Facebook.\nHogan\u2019s competing bill will be introduced in the coming days, according to spokeswoman Shareese Churchill. It is unlikely to pass in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly.\n\u201cRegardless of the actions they take, legislators will fail,\u201d Hogan said.\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be the end of it,\u201d Minority Whip Sen. Stephen Hershey, R-Kent, Queen Anne\u2019s, Cecil and Caroline, said after the bill passed in the Senate Tuesday. \u201cThe governor and the comptroller might team up again and go to referendum, and maybe we can get the people to vote on this issue to determine what\u2019s most important for the state of Maryland.\u201d\nComptroller Peter Franchot, D, cited increased tax revenue in his support for the governor\u2019s later school start.",

Anne Arundel County opposes the bill due to fiscal impacts and preference for local control over curricular decisions.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Legislation that would require 150 minutes of physical activity, including 90 minutes of physical education, a week for elementary school students in Maryland was heard by the House Ways and Means committee on Thursday.\nThe Student Health and Fitness Act requires schools to create a physical leadership activity team to fill the remaining 60 minutes with \u201cmoderate to vigorous\u201d activity.\nAllegany, Anne Arundel, Cecil, Montgomery, Queen Anne\u2019s and Somerset counties would need to hire more teachers to account for the new physical education \u2014 or P.E. \u2014 requirements.\nAn increase of $19.9 million or significantly more would be needed in the 2020 fiscal year to fund these counties that have maximums of 45 or 60 minutes per week in P.E., according to the Maryland Department of Education.\nDelegate Jay Walker, D-Prince George\u2019s, sponsored the bill \u2014 which failed last legislative session \u2014 and said it was not helpful that his daughters were only receiving one day of P.E. a week.\n\u201cI realized that children in my county, throughout the state, we have a problem with childhood obesity,\u201d Walker told Capital News Service.\nThe Anne Arundel County Board of Education is opposing the bill because of the fiscal consequences, and argued allotting P.E. time should be up to local jurisdictions.\nAnne Arundel currently has 60 minutes of P.E. required a week, and officials estimated it would cost the county $3.5 million to rollout changes in fiscal year 2020.\n\u201cIt is critical for a local board of education to retain the authority to address curricular issues for its schools,\u201d the board said in a written testimony.\nMatt Slatkin, a physical education teacher in Montgomery County, told lawmakers the time set aside for physical education is a proactive and cost-effective strategy for boosting students\u2019 well-being.\n\u201cThis falls under the moral obligation of \u2018see something, say something\u2019 for me,\u201d Slatkin said.\n\nVideo by:  Chandler Parr\nDelegate Eric Luedtke, D-Montgomery, said physical education has been proven to help health disparities, but said there was an argument on how much the legislature should get involved.\nLuedtke said schools have changed their priorities based on academic subjects the federal government measures and tracks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural that schools would de-emphasize some of these things,\u201d said Luedtke.\nWalker said making the change to P.E. policy would save money down the road, by helping prevent health care issues.\nA 2018 CDC report found 60 minutes of physical activity a day helps prevent obesity. The report also cited a Washington State Institute for Public Policy study that determined increased physical activity boosts academic achievement.\n\u201cThe parents think they\u2019re getting the P.E. in school, but they\u2019re really not, so we need to bring it back,\u201d said Walker.\nWalker, who was a National Football League quarterback for the New England Patriots in 1994, said 90 minutes of physical education a week helps with test taking, physical being and wellness.\n\u201cIt teaches you about how to socialize, how to be competitive, how to have confidence and how to overcome,\u201d Walker said.",

    "summary": "The Kirwan Commission has proposed a $3.8 billion plan to reform Maryland's public schools over the next decade, focusing on early childhood education, teacher status, and equal access, among other areas. Chairman William Kirwan expects steady improvements in pre-K, tutoring, and special education, aiming for a school system that will be \"the envy of the country.\"",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland \u2014 Parents can expect to see advances in pre-K, tutoring and special education first, among all of the recommendations of a statewide education reform panel, according to its namesake chairman, William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan.\n\u201cWhat parents will see is just a steady drumbeat of improvement in the experiences that their children are having in the schools,\u201d Kirwan told Capital News Service.\nThe Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, or Kirwan Commission, finalized in December its recommendations and costs to fix large achievement gaps, boost school funding for poorer students, and improve teacher retention for Maryland public schools from 2020 to 2030.\nDetermining the geographic distribution of the funds is the next step for the commission, which presented an overview of its $3.8 billion plan to a joint legislative committee on Thursday.\n\u201cWe will see a school system in Maryland that will be the envy of the country and perform at the level of the best performing systems around the world,\u201d if all the recommendations are funded, Kirwan said.\nKirwan said the commission wants $325 million to jumpstart the program this year; Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, R, has allocated $235.8 million in his fiscal year 2020 budget proposal.\nKirwan said the commission is focusing on five major policy areas to be incorporated into the Maryland school system over the next 10 years: Investing in early childhood education; elevating teaching into a high-status profession; creating college and career-ready pathways; ensuring all students have equal access to education; and implementing an oversight board for accountability.\n\u201cWe have to think of this as a carefully quilted package of initiatives that fit together as a whole,\u201d Kirwan said.\nSteven Hershkowitz, policy director of the Maryland State Education Association, said under current funding formulas, free public pre-K is only available to 4-year-olds at income levels 185 percent of the poverty line or below.\nHershkowitz said with the Kirwan plan, free access for public programs would also include 3-year-olds, and expand to income levels at 300 percent of the poverty line or below.\nAn expanded pre-K program and revamping how college preparedness tests works by creating a 10th grade test that determines career readiness would create new pathways to success for students, Hershkowitz said.\nHershkowitz said the teachers union is more supportive than frustrated by the Kirwan recommendations, but said he is concerned about requiring National Board Certification for teachers.\nHe said there is no state that has come close to making all teachers reach the \u201cgold-standard,\u201d of certification.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a route that every teacher wants to take,\u201d Hershkowitz said. \u201cWe would like there to still be more options for teachers.\u201d\nKirwan told lawmakers that Massachusetts, which launched education reform in 1993, was an example for the committee\u2019s recommendations.\nThe changes increased state aid to schools, set higher goals for academic achievement, and required more accountability in the education system, three points the Maryland plan includes.\nHowever, Sen. Arthur Ellis, D-Charles, said in Massachusetts, minority communities did not excel following the changes; a study released in September found black and Latino students trailed behind white students in reading, grade and income level.\n\u201cWe have a lot of low income, minority, rural communities left out of the progress,\u201d said Ellis.\nEllis said Kirwan\u2019s recommendations of wrap-around services at community schools that provide mental health, nutrition and physical support in the school building would be a \u201ctremendous solution.\u201d\n\u201cA kid shows up and they\u2019re hungry, they\u2019re not going to learn,\u201d said Ellis.\nHershkowitz said Kirwan\u2019s planned investments into a community-school model would be prioritized for areas with high concentrations of poverty.\nSen. Jack Bailey, R-Calvert and St. Mary\u2019s, said a 2016 study showed recommendations for St. Mary\u2019s County would cause a 5 percent increase in funding, but still put them on the same level playing field as other counties.\n\u201cObviously we want a world-class education, but we want a funding formula that works for us, especially in rural counties,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWe want equality.\u201d\nKirwan said Massachusetts\u2019 shortcomings among minorities made the commission \u201cplace laser-like focus on equity.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned from what Massachusetts didn\u2019t do,\u201d said Kirwan. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave any kid behind, this has to be for all of our children.\u201d\nHe said equality was one of the most important recommendations, and told lawmakers that in the plan, more resources would be portioned to schools with high concentrations of impoverished students.\nFinding a revenue stream is the third stage of the Kirwan plan, and would be up to the Legislature, Hershkowitz said.\n\u201cEducation, education, education,\u201d would be the Legislature\u2019s top priority for the 2019 session, Senate President Mike Miller, D-Prince George, Charles and Calvert said earlier this month.\nLegislators have tossed around multiple ideas on how to raise the revenue required for the commission, from legalization of marijuana to sports betting.\nMiller and House Speaker Michael Busch, D-Anne Arundel, have both entertained the idea of legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s (recreational marijuana is) the future,\u201d Busch said earlier this month. \u201cIt will be much like overturning prohibition.\u201d\nBut Delegate Maggie McIntosh, D-Baltimore, said last week she is concerned about budgetary consequences with the state losing an estimated $1.3 million to $1.5 million a day due to the government shutdown.\n\u201cI think we have to be careful, and we will be,\u201d said McIntosh.\nKirwan said he recognizes the General Assembly has to deal with the realities of spending affordability and said he hopes they will do all they can to fund the recommendations.\nKirwan said Maryland\u2019s economic future is dependent on a well educated workforce, and that high quality education is the only path out of poverty.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to do this,\u201d said Kirwan.",

Larry Hogan, resigned after a closed-door meeting of the regents Thursday afternoon, just a day after University of Maryland President Wallace Loh defied the board and fired head coach DJ Durkin.\nThe rally, which was originally organized by university\u2019s Student Government Association, shifted its focus from protesting the board\u2019s recommendation to retain Durkin to backing the athletes, whose program is reeling from 48 hours of shocking twists and turns.\nCOLLEGE PARK \u2013 A sign at a student rally on the University of Maryland campus carries a quote from Ida B.

Three players walked out of a Wednesday meeting with the coach. Some donors also threatened to withdraw support from the university.\nWhile there were many in the rally who were in support of the football program, there were others who wanted to boycott the upcoming game against Michigan State.\n\u201cWe are not in opposition to the football team,\u201d said junior Alice Smith. \u201cWe do not hate those people, we know they are students too. But we want to see change for them. We want things to get better for them. And I do not think going to the games is going to help that.\u201d\nOthers wanted to hold the Board of Regents more accountable.\n\u201cGo up there and demand that this Board of Regents answers to you,\u201d said former football player Akil Patterson to counter-protesters. \u201cThis Board of Regents calls on you. Answer their call. You are the future, not them.\u201d\nCOLLEGE PARK \u2013 A student was brought to tears by a student rally at the University of Maryland in memory of Jordan McNair.

Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said Loh \u201ctook the appropriate action\u201d in firing Durkin and said the head coach\u2019s actions ultimately led to McNair\u2019s death.\n\u201cPresident Loh took responsibility for this tragedy and assured the McNair family that a full investigation would be pursued, which he initiated and the University System of Maryland Board of Regents took over,\u201d Hoyer said in a statement.\nHoyer also added he believes Loh should reconsider his retirement and continue to focus on putting the athletic department on \u201ca path worthy of respect and dignity.\u201d\nOther politicians, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore. took to social media to question why the leadership at the university was still intact.\n\u201cThe tragic death of Jordan McNair showed that there is a toxic climate at UMD,\u201d Cummings said via Twitter. \u201cI am not satisfied with the remedies enacted by the University System of Maryland to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\n\nThe tragic death of Jordan McNair showed that there is a toxic climate within the football program at UMD. I am not satisfied with the remedies enacted by the University System of Maryland to ensure this never happens again.\n\u2014 Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) October 31, 2018\n\nThe board ended its four-month investigation into Maryland\u2019s football program by concluding that it did not have a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d as was previously alleged by an ESPN story written by Heather Dinich. This contradicted a previous investigation that found Maryland culpable for McNair\u2019s death.\nHowever, the board did find that there were \u201cproblems that festered\u201d within the athletic department, Brady said Tuesday, and it did not give Durkin, a first-time head coach in his third year, the tools to succeed.\nThe board recommended that Durkin retain his job, saying that while he shared \u201csome responsibility\u201d in McNair\u2019s death, the head coach was \u201cunfairly blamed\u201d for what happened.\nThe board also recommended that athletic director Damon Evans keep his job. Loh announced his retirement at the end of the academic year in the same press conference.\nDespite the recommendation from the board, Loh fired Durkin one day later, after listening to concerns from the university\u2019s Student Government Association President Jonathan Allen and the majority of university stakeholders, all of which wanted Durkin gone.\n\u201cThis is not at all a reflection of my opinion of Coach Durkin as a person,\u201d Loh said in a statement. \u201cHowever, a departure is in the best interest of the university, and this afternoon Coach Durkin was informed that the university will part ways.\u201d\n(Capital News Service Washington bureau reporters Jared Goldstein, Samantha Rosen and Morgan Caplan contributed to this story.)",

McNair died two weeks later due to complications from heatstroke. \nIt wasn\u2019t until after ESPN published stories on the specifics of McNair\u2019s death and the alleged \u201ctoxic\u201d culture under Durkin that Loh issued an investigation into the incident. \nFans, politicians and players took to social media to criticize and praise the Board of Regent\u2019s findings, though overall sentiment was negative.\nSeveral Maryland football players showed support for their fallen teammate.\n\nEvery Saturday my teammates and I have to kneel before the memorial of our fallen teammate. Yet a group of people do not have the courage to hold anyone accountable for his death. If only they could have the courage that Jordan had.
