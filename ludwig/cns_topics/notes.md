CNS Topic Analysis
October 4, 2025

---

## Notes from browsing CNS and tag browser

### Most common topic areas I see in CNS' reporting (in very rough order):
1. Politics (seems to be evenly split between federal and local)
2. Federal policy impacts on Maryland
3. Education
4. Health
5. Economy
6. Immigration
7. Crime
8. Transportion (I have a feeling before this administration this would've been higher, above immigration and crime)
9. Housing
10. Arts & Culture (including more "feel-good" stories about communities and cultural history)
11. Military
12. Energy

### What I see largely missing:
- Science & Technology
- Animals
- Agriculture
- International Affairs (with the exception of major wars)

The missing tags are still important to most people in Maryland; their stories may just be less frequent or reported on by CNS. But we can probably consolidate some of them and remove ones that may be too broad or useless.

### Topics that are too broad:
- Federal Government and Politics
- Maryland Government and Politics (this seems to overlap with federal government and politics a lot, so we should probably consolidate government topics by their category/area rather than level of government)
- Economy (too vague since it overlaps with Commerce, Trade, Labor, Budget, Taxes)
- Law (overlaps with Justice and Civil Rights)

### Topics that overlap significantly:
- Budget and Taxes
- Commerce and Trade + Economy
- Justice and Law
- Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (and Chesapeake Bay, for that matter)
- Congress and Federal Government and Politics and Elections

### Maryland-specific observations:
I think a lot of our non-Maryland-specific topics from our current list can apply to stories CNS reports on.

When it comes to creating new CNS/Maryland topics, we should find ones that fit what CNS reports on without being overly general that they could apply to news from any part of the country.

I think there are a few Maryland-related topics that are A) unique to the state, B) important to its residents (economically, socially, culturally, etc.) and C) frequently reported on by CNS. Topics like the Chesapeake Bay and commuting would fit into that category (commuting isn't "unique" to Maryland obviously, but the specific commutes Marylanders take to D.C. and other Maryland cities have unique problems and projects related to them, like the Purple Line).

Maybe others will challenge me (and I'm definitely open to changing my mind here), but I don't think creating topics for specific, temporary things like the Purple Line would be smart because eventually you would end up with a long, unwieldly list of topics (like our CNS tags). Many topics would rotate in and out, whereas I believe a strong topic list should withstand the test of time.

## Revised Topic List

(Roughly split up into broader categories)

```
Government topics:
1. State Government
    (Specifically carving out Maryland government stories.)
2. Federal Impact
    (I chose this because it feels like CNS focuses more on the *effects* of federal government policies, rather than general federal news. Specifically creating a "federal impact" topic felt like it would be distinct from others, yet still frequently used.)
3. Elections & Campaigns

Economic topics:
4. Budget & Spending
    (This could apply for both federal and local stories.)
5. Labor & Employment
    (Same for this.)
6. Economic Impact
    (Again, I don't see CNS reporting a lot on general economic news. Rather, they focus on the impacts of economic policies on Maryland residents.)

Justice topics:
7. Social Justice
    (Carving this out felt necessary since I see a lot of social justice-related stories on CNS that feel specific-enough to warrant their own topic.)
8. State Court
9. Federal Court
    (I'm trying to separate federal and state government topics without having them be too broad for either one.)

Education topics:
10. K-12 Education
11. Higher Education
12. Public Education
13. Private Education
    (CNS does a lot of education reporting so providing more specific topics here felt necessary.)

Health topics:
14. Healthcare
15. Public Health
    (A little worried these are too broad since you could argue many different things have impacts on public health, like the environment or technology.)

Environmental topics:
16. Environment
17. Energy
18. Chesapeake Bay
19. Agriculture

Infrastructure-y topics:
20. Private Transportation
21. Public Transit
22. Commuting
23. Housing & Development

Cultural topics:
24. Arts & Culture
25. History

Others:
26. Immigration
    (The political moment right now feels like this warrants more topics, but I'm not sure what they should be without getting overly specific like "ICE".)
27. Military
28. Sports
    (Need ideas here. Not a sports person.)
29. Technology
    (I would split this into more specific topics, but CNS doesn't do enough reporting on science and technology to warrant that yet.)
```

## Limitations & Notes

We talked about it in class, but it's surprisingly difficult to distill an entire collection of stories into generalized topics like this—I definitely struggled with this assignment (payback for my vibe coding being a breeze, I guess). When making the topics, you have to make sure they're broad enough to simplify searching for stories, but specific enough to actually be useful. I don't feel entirely happy with the topics I chose, but maybe that's also a limitation of classifying stories into topics to begin with? I'm curious if others will feel the same way.

Also, I am not a sports person whatsoever! I am 100% sure others in the class will have better ideas for how we can break down the "sports" category into topics that are more specific (both to sports and Maryland/CNS).

## LLM Conversations

I chatted with my tag browser bot (which uses OpenAI OSS 120b) so I'm including that conversation here:

Me:
```
What policy areas appear the most in these tag names?
```

Bot:
```
Policy‑area terms that show up most often in CNS Maryland tag names (based on simple keyword searches of the tag‑name field)

| Policy area (keyword) | Approx. # of tag names that contain the term |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| health | 166 |
| education | 85 |
| justice (including “social justice”, “juvenile justice”, etc.) | 63 |
| environment | 55 |
| policy (the word “policy” itself) | 42 |
| energy | 39 |
| econom‑ / economic (e.g., “economy”, “economic”, “economic development”) | 35 |
| crime | 32 |
| transportation | 21 |
| housing | 18 |

How this was determined – I ran a series of keyword searches (e.g., searchtags with queries like “health”, “education”, “justice”, etc.) and recorded the totalmatches value each time. Those totals give a quick, data‑driven view of how frequently each policy‑area term appears in tag names across the entire dataset.

What this tells you

Health‑related tags dominate the tag set, reflecting a strong focus on health topics in CNS Maryland coverage.

Education is the next most common policy area.

Justice, environment, and the generic policy term also appear frequently, indicating substantial reporting on legal, environmental, and broader policy matters.

Topics such as energy, economics, crime, transportation, and housing are present but at lower frequencies.


If you’d like a deeper dive—e.g., the top individual tags within each of these policy areas, or a visual distribution of tag‑usage counts for a given area—just let me know and I can pull those details for you.
